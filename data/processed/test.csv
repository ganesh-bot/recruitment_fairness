It is not yet known whether a low-calorie diet and/or physical activity program is effective in preventing cancer in participants at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying diet and physical activity in healthy overweight, obese, or inactive participants at risk of developing colorectal cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* To compare four 12-week energy-balance interventions comprising a physical activity intervention (+2,000 kcal/wk), a dietary energy restriction intervention (DER)(-2,000 kcal/wk), or a combined physical activity and DER intervention (+1,000/-1,000 kcal/wk) vs no intervention in healthy, overweight, or moderately obese participants at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer.
* To quantify changes in circulating biomarkers (e.g., insulin, IGF-1, leptin, c-reactive protein, or isoprostanes) proposed to mediate the anticarcinogenic effects of DER in these participants.

OUTLINE: This study consists of a 2-week run-in period (baseline) followed by a 12-week intervention period.

Participants undergo three study visits at Vanderbilt University General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). Beginning at study visit 1, participants undergo a 2-week run-in period to obtain baseline measures of body composition (via dual x-ray absorptiometry), cardiorespiratory fitness (via treadmill testing), physical activity, dietary intake, energy expenditure, and metabolic activity. Dietary assessments using 24-hour dietary recalls are conducted by the GCRC dietitian during the run-in period. GCRC dietitians complete three 24-hour recalls on randomly selected days during the 2-week assessment period to provide an estimate of the participant's habitual food intake at baseline. Baseline energy needs are assessed during activity monitored run-in period to obtain measures of the participant's resting energy expenditure and total daily energy expenditure. Participants are also assessed using a brief psychological profile that is used to individualize the study intervention for each participant.

Approximately 10-14 days after the initial visit and after all baseline assessments have been completed, participants undergo a second study visit. Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms.

* Arm I (physical activity): Participants undergo an in-person, 30- to 60-minute counseling visit, followed by five brief 10- to 15-minute telephone-counseling calls over 12 weeks. During the initial counseling session, participants learn about goal setting and how to develop a personalized plan for meeting their intervention goals. Participants are instructed about wearing proper shoes and about monitoring their exercise duration and intensity. Participants are also given pedometers to help track their activity patterns and to monitor their progress in meeting program objectives. Participants must wear the pedometers for 7 days at baseline and again at 12 weeks. The information provided is used to estimate overall physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), steps per day, and time spent in different levels of activity.

Participants are monitored periodically for adherence to the exercise program through behavioral counseling and self-reported logs of daily exercise and pedometer steps. Dietary intake is measured periodically using multiple 24-hour dietary recalls to carefully assess possible changes in energy intake and dietary quality over the course of the study.

* Arm II (dietary energy restriction \[DER\]): Based on the initial estimate of energy needs determined during the run-in period, participants receive a reduced-calorie, food exchange-based diet for 12 weeks. Each diet is individualized to achieve the desired daily energy deficit of 300 calories per day based on physical activity levels. All meals are prepared by the GCRC metabolic kitchen. Participants receive one multivitamin per day and no other nutritional supplements. Fluids including coffee, water, and other drinks are allowed at the pre-study level. Each week, participants meet with the dietitian to discuss the participant's progress, submit daily reports of food intake, return uneaten food items, and to provide urine samples for assessment of urinary biomarkers.

Adherence to the diet is monitored by compliance with food pick-up, dietary records, and measures of urinary metabolites. Participants are also provided with individual instruction, counseling, and assessment by the study dietitian.

* Arm III (physical activity and DER): Participants undergo a 12-week DER and physical-activity program, as described in arms I and II, with the exception that the dose of PAEE and DER in the combined intervention (i.e., +1,000/-1,000 kcal/week) is half that of each individual intervention (+2,000 kcal/week for arm I and -2,000 kcal/week for arm II). Participants in arm III receive an individualized reduced-calorie diet designed to achieve a desired daily energy deficit of 150 calories per day based on participant physical activity levels.
* Arm IV (wait-list control): Participants are followed periodically. At study visit 3, after completion of the 12-week study interventions, participants undergo repeat assessment of body composition, fitness, diet, and activity measures.

Participants undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and at 12 weeks for correlative laboratory studies. Blood samples are assessed for circulating biomarkers that are involved in energy homeostasis and metabolic control (e.g., insulin, IGF, and leptin) and inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., c-reactive protein, PGE-2, and isoprostanes). Urine samples are examined for biomarkers of dietary protein intake (i.e., nitrogen content), dietary sodium, and potassium intake.

Participants complete the Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline and at 12 weeks for assessment of PAEE through non-occupational activities, including social activities, recreation, hobbies, housework, walking, jogging, and 14 other types of exercise.","Inclusion Criteria:

Participants are also provided with individual instruction, counseling, and assessment by the study dietitian. * Arm III (physical activity and DER): Participants undergo a 12-week DER and physical-activity program, as described in arms I and II, with the exception that the dose of PAEE and DER in the combined intervention (i.e., +1,000/-1,000 kcal/week) is half that of each individual intervention (+2,000 kcal/week for arm I and -2,000 kcal/week for arm II). Participants in arm III receive an individualized reduced-calorie diet designed to achieve a desired daily energy deficit of 150 calories per day based on participant physical activity levels. * Arm IV (wait-list control): Participants are followed periodically. At study visit 3, after completion of the 12-week study interventions, participants undergo repeat assessment of body composition, fitness, diet, and activity measures. Participants undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and at 12 weeks for correlative laboratory studies. Blood samples are assessed for circulating biomarkers that are involved in energy homeostasis and metabolic control (e.g., insulin, IGF, and leptin) and inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., c-reactive protein, PGE-2, and isoprostanes). Urine samples are examined for biomarkers of dietary protein intake (i.e., nitrogen content), dietary sodium, and potassium intake. Participants complete the Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline and at 12 weeks for assessment of PAEE through non-occupational activities, including social activities, recreation, hobbies, housework, walking, jogging, and 14 other types of exercise.

PURPOSE: This cluster randomized controlled trial will compare active and passive interventions to increase the rate of appropriate genetic counseling referrals of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at increased risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the community oncology setting.","Approximately 5-10% of all breast cancer patients have hereditary breast cancer, the majority due to an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (BRCA mutation carriers). Breast cancer patients who are BRCA mutation carriers have up to a 65% risk for a new primary breast cancer in the future. Additionally, BRCA mutation carriers have a 10-45% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer.

Effective options to decrease these high future cancer risks are available to breast cancer patients who learn they carry a BRCA mutation - including prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy. Prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy reduce the risks for future primary breast cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively, by more than 90%. Because of the high risks for future cancer and the opportunity for effective risk reduction among mutation carriers, national guidelines consistently recommend referral of breast cancer patients at increased risk for hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to genetic counseling by a qualified genetics professional. Lack of implementation of this standard of care constitutes an error of omission and jeopardizes patient outcomes.

We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare a ""passive intervention"" - dissemination of professional guidelines - with an ""active intervention"" - a multi-faceted provider education and decision support intervention to improve 1) appropriate referral of breast cancer patients at risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the community cancer center setting and 2) pre-surgical referral among newly diagnosed patients.

University of Illinois at Chicago,OTHER,NCT02337179,Male Circumcision Services for HIV Prevention in the Dominican Republic,A Pilot Study to Introduce Male Circumcision (MC) Services to Prevent HIV Infection in Two High Prevalence Areas of the Dominican Republic (DR),The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of introducing voluntary medical male circumcision as a form of HIV prevention in high HIV prevalence areas in the Dominican Republic.,"Voluntary Medical Male circumcision (VMMC) is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. Observational data and randomized controlled trails (RCTs) conducted in Africa(1,2,3) suggest that the procedure reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by 50-76% in heterosexual males. VMMC has also been shown to reduce the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections (STI), including herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papilloma virus (HPV) in men(4), and Chlamydia(5), trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and HPV in their female partners(6).

The results of the RCT's are generating increased demand for safe and affordable MC services in areas of moderate-to-high HIV prevalence where the MC rates are low. Latin America is a region where circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic (DR), which is the focus of this study, a 2007 nationwide household survey found that only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 were circumcised(8).

AIDS is the leading cause of death in the Caribbean basin among adults aged 15-44 years. There are approximately 240,000 people currently living with the disease, most of them residing in the Dominican Republic (DR) and Haiti(9). The prevalence of HIV infection in the DR is approximately 0.8% nationwide(8) but it is higher in selected high-risk populations, such as among people living in the ""bateyes"", the small towns surrounding sugar cane plantations, where the prevalence is 3.2%(10). In pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the Altagracia province HIV seroprevalence is 4.5 %(11). One of the areas of highest prevalence (1.2%) in the country is Region V of health, which includes the provinces of La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, La Romana and San Pedro de Macorís. Prevalence is also higher in the urban slums of the capital city, Santo Domingo.

The public health impact of introducing MC as a strategy to prevent HIV/STI transmission in areas of high HIV/STI prevalence and low MC rates can be significant. In addition to decreasing the rates of HIV and other STI, the intervention could indirectly help decrease the rates of HPV associated cervical cancer. The study proposed here is to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate pilot MC services in selected sites to assess the acceptability, uptake, safety and demand for these services, and to use these data to develop, in collaboration with the Dominican Ministry of Health (MoH), a proposal to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for support of operations research concerning the safety, uptake, and efficacy of MC interventions in the DR.

1. Specific Aims:

   Based on the results of numerous observational studies and the three RCTs the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have endorsed VMMC as a biomedical intervention for HIV prevention. As such, countries with a high prevalence of HIV in the population are encouraged to examine the feasibility of offering MC services as part of the portfolio of HIV prevention strategies at a national level. The specific aims for this project are:
   1. To develop culturally appropriate education materials about the benefits of VMMC for clients attending pilot healthcare centers.
   2. To train a core group of providers on proper surgical and counseling techniques to provide comprehensive VMMC services.
   3. To determine the acceptability, uptake and demand for MC services in key areas of high HIV prevalence.

      H1: The acceptability and uptake among high risk men will be around 60%.
   4. To assess the safety and adverse events of performing circumcision in resource constrained settings.

      H2: VMMC will result in a complication rate of less than 2%.
   5. To assess sexual risk behaviors, perceptions of sexual function and sexual pleasure in men before and after VMMC. H3: there will be no differences in risk behaviors, sexual function and pleasure after VMMC.
   6. Estimate point prevalence of most common STI in a subset of circumcised men and preserve a small sample of blood to test future scientific hypothesis and/or newer testing techniques as they become available.
   7. To build collaborations with the MoH and other partners in the DR and at UIC to develop a proposal to NIMH for operational research in the context of larger scale MC service provision.
2. Background and significance:

b.1. Male Circumcision to Prevent HIV Transmission Male circumcision is perhaps one of the oldest surgical procedures performed on humans. The millenary practice of removing the male foreskin has cultural, religious and medical dimensions that have been widely studied. Around the world, the procedure is mostly performed for religious reasons in persons of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Medical indications for MC include phimosis, paraphimosis and balanitis, among others(12). Early evidence of a relationship between MC and HIV infection came from a number of smaller, mostly observational studies, done in Africa(13). These historical data were validated with the completion of three large RCTs in South Africa, Kenya and Uganda, which have shown an overall decrease of 50-76% in the risk of acquiring HIV infection in circumcised males when compared to controls(1,2,3).

The pathogenesis of the initial infection at the level of the foreskin involves tissue macrophages, cell receptors and a moist, poorly keratinized inner prepuce. The first cellular target of the HIV virion on the human genitalia are the tissue dendritic cells in the lamina propria of the submucosa(14). These cells express surface CD4 receptors and CCR5 co-receptors for which HIV has high affinity. In intact human skin, the dendritic cells are shielded from the outer environment by the relatively thick layer of keratin covering the surface of the epithelia. Tissue studies of the human foreskin have shown that the inner lining of the prepuce, exposed during a penile erection, has a thin keratin layer that is very susceptible to microscopic abrasions and can expose the tissue macrophages making them vulnerable to infection by HIV(15).

b.2. MC for STI prevention: MC is an effective strategy to decrease the risk of infection with HIV and other STI in heterosexual males. A beneficial effect has also been observed in decreasing the risk of STI in females. The RCTs confirmed that VMMC decreases herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) acquisition by 29%, and HPV prevalence by 34% in men(4). Among female partners of circumcised men, bacterial vaginosis was reduced by 40%, and trichomonas vaginalis infection was reduced by 48%(6). Genital ulcer disease was also reduced among males and their female partners by approximately half(16).

b.3. HIV in the Caribbean and the Dominican Republic: The significant decrease in the rate of HIV acquisition observed among circumcised males who participated in the African RCT is generating an increased demand for safe and affordable VMMC services in areas of high HIV prevalence where the procedure is not routinely performed. Latin America is one of such areas where routine circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic, only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 years are circumcised(8). The Caribbean is the region of the world with the highest HIV prevalence outside of sub-Saharan Africa (1.0%)(9). Approximately 240,000 individuals are currently living with the disease. Among the Caribbean countries, the Dominican Republic and Haiti report the highest prevalence in the region. According to data from a recent In the DR, the prevalence of HIV infection is 0.8% nationwide(8), however, the numbers are higher in selected populations and in certain geographic locations.

The Dominican healthcare system is administratively divided in 9 regions, which include the country's 31 provinces. Region 0 of health includes the National District and the provinces of Santo Domingo and Monte Plata. The city of Santo Domingo is the capital and financial center of the DR. It has an estimated population of 2.7 million people spread in an area of about 1,400 KM2. 90% of the population lives in an urban setting in this province(17). The overall prevalence of HIV is around 0.7 % in the entire region but is higher in vulnerable groups such as commercial sex workers (CSW) (3.3%), Men who Have Sex with Men (MSM) (5.9%) and drug users (7.1%)(18).

Regions V and VII report the highest prevalence of HIV in the country, 1.2 % and 1.5% respectively(8). Specific populations within these provinces have rates of HIV considerably higher than the national average. For instance, prevalence is 3.2% in the bateyes, the small communities surrounding sugar cane plantations, where a mixed population of Dominicans and Haitian migrant workers cohabitate. Our team has conducted preliminary studies in the Altagracia Province, part of Region V, since it reports the highest province-specific HIV rates and the lowest circumcision rates in the country. A survey of pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the province found an HIV seroprevalence of 4.5 %11. The prevalence of HIV is 5.2% in CSW, 7.6% in MSM and 8.5 % among drug users(18).

c) Preliminary studies: The parent study for this project is a RCT of VMMC to reduce HIV incidence in Kisumu, Kenya whose principal investigator is Prof. Robert C. Bailey, a co-investigator in the current proposal(3). The main objective of that trial was to assess the effectiveness of VMMC in reducing HIV incidence in young, sexually active men. The protective effect found in an intent-to-treat analysis was 53% and in an as treated analysis adjusting for cross-overs and men found to be HIV seropositive at baseline estimated the protective effect to be 60%. Adverse events related to the surgical procedure were few, just 1.5%. Behavioral disinhibition (risk compensation) on the part of circumcised men was small and not significant.

Drs. Brito and Bailey conducted a feasibility study of healthcare facilities in the Altagracia province in the Dominican Republic during June and July of 2007. A total of 37 healthcare facilities were surveyed. The study found that most facilities lacked appropriate equipment to perform surgical procedures and only four (11%) had a surgical theater. 43 healthcare workers, the majority of them physicians (91%), were interviewed for the study. Only 23 % of the personnel had experience performing MC and a significant number of providers (76%) believed they needed comprehensive training in the procedure prior to starting a MC program. Quantitative and qualitative studies to assess the acceptability of MC among men, women and providers in the Altagracia Province were conducted in 2008. In these studies, 73% of men thought that MC improved hygiene and approximately one third knew that it reduces the risk of penile cancer or STI. Only a small percentage (21%) knew that MC helps prevent HIV infection. When first asked, 29% of participants reported that they would be willing to be circumcised if the procedure was offered to them. However, after an educational session detailing the benefits of the procedure for HIV and STI prevention, the acceptability increased to 67%. Such increment was also observed in previous studies done in Botswana(19) and Thailand(20)where acceptability increased from 61 % to 81% and from 14% to 66%, respectively, after a similar information session. In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of men's acceptability of circumcision, before the information session, were Haitian nationality (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.41), thinking that circumcision improves hygiene (OR=2.78, 95% CI 1.29-6.0) and not believing that having a circumcision decreases sexual pleasure (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.20-3.94). These results have been published (21, 22).

We also conducted 13 focus group discussions (FGD), 6 with women and 7 with men, each consisting of 6-10 participants (mean=7.9, SD=1.3). One additional FGD was conducted with six physicians, two males and four females, working in rural clinics around the province. Findings of this qualitative study showed that a significant number of participants might be willing to be circumcised, or agree with circumcision for their partners, to improve hygiene, prevent diseases and treat medical conditions, such as phimosis, which can result in pain during intercourse. These results are consistent with our quantitative study on men's acceptability of MC. Perhaps one of the most important findings of the FGD was the enthusiastic endorsement of MC by women, a fact that has potential implications for the successful implementation of a circumcision program in the country (22).

Overall, our preliminary data suggest that men are willing to be circumcised provided they receive information about the benefits of the procedure. Before recommending the introduction of VMMC services as part of a comprehensive package of HIV and other STI prevention strategies, these findings need to be confirmed by studying the uptake of VMMC among sexually active men in selected clinics that serve clients in high prevalence areas. In addition, there is need to identify potential barriers to offering MC services in high risk communities prior to proposing to implement a large-scale intervention. In order to properly address these concerns, we will conduct a pilot study that will provide the necessary preliminary data to design a proposal to the NIMH to conduct operational research around a large-scale implementation project.

d) Experimental design and methods: d.1. Pilot study design The study will be conducted at two sites: the STI clinic at Instituto Dermatologico and Cirugia de Piel (IDCP) in Santo Domingo and the Clínica de Familia in La Romana, Dominican Republic. These sites have been selected on the basis of: 1) high numbers of male clients at risk for HIV and STI infection in communities served by the clinics; 2) high level of acceptability of MC among men in the communities served by the clinics (bateyes of Altagracia); 3) the availability of service providers willing to be trained; 4) the availability of equipment; and 5) the availability of infrastructure, including a minor surgical theater, sterilization facilities and HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and STI management.

During the first phase of the study, culturally appropriate educational material will be created in Spanish by the principal investigator and local collaborators. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews will be conducted with members of the community to learn the educational needs of the community and to assess their opinions on how to best deliver the information on MC that will be contained in the educational materials.

We plan to conduct the FGD in the communities served by the Instituto Dermatologico and the Clinica de Familia, the two main study sites. The plan is to assemble groups of 6-12 participants from the population living in these communities. Community leaders, health promoters, teachers and primary care physicians will be asked to help identify and invite volunteers from their respective communities to participate in the study. There will be no difference in the recruitment process for men and women. They will be recruited from the same venues (schools, clubs, community centers) . Participants will be invited to participate by research personnel with the help of local leaders. These local leaders may be of both genders and will help recruit participants from either gender. The focus groups will be gender-specific. The moderator will explain the purpose of the study to participants. Verbal consent will be obtained from all participants and an information sheet outlining the objectives of the study, their privacy and confidentiality rights and our contact information will be distributed. The document will highlight the voluntary nature of the subject's participation and their right to leave the discussion at anytime if they so desire. The study meets the definition of ""minimal risk"", therefore, we are requesting a waiver of written consent. We believe this will further preserve the confidentiality of the participants. The goal is to conduct no more than 15 FGD. Participants in the FGD will be divided by gender. We plan to recruit approximately the same number of men and women for the FGD.

In addition to the FGD, several in-depth individual interviews may be conducted using the same guide than in the FGD. A script will be followed to conduct the FGD. The discussions will be stimulated by using a list of carefully crafted questions on the subject of MC. These questions are designed to obtain information on the following aspects relevant to our investigation:

1. Perception of the population about the frequency of MC in community men.
2. Opinions on the best way to educate men in the community about the benefits of circumcision.
3. Opinions about the content of the educational materials educational and how information should be delivered.
4. Where should these educational material be posted or distributed to capture the most number of men.
5. Opinions on the best venue to organize educational sessions featuring a circumcised man that would be available to answer question from men in the community about his satisfaction with his circumcision.
6. Perceptions about who would be a good person to educate men about the benefits of circumcision in the community.
7. Opinions on the best way to involve women in the community in a campaign to recruit men for circumcision.

The moderator and a research assistant (RA) will lead the discussions. All FGD will be audiotaped and detailed notes will be taken. The content of the recordings will be transcribed shortly after the end of the meeting. The PI, a native Spanish speaker, will be responsible for translating the recordings from Spanish to English. The English-version transcripts will be coded using the program ATLAS.ti vers. 5.2 based on template of topical categories drawn from questions and issues covered in the discussion guides and from themes emerging from the discussions themselves. The interviews will be conducted by one of the co-investigators. Verbal consent will be obtained and a document containing information about the study will be provided to the participants. All data obtained during this study, including recordings and notes will be de-indentified. The names of the participants will not be recorded to protect their confidentiality.

Data Management All notes, audio recordings and study material obtained during the FGD and interviews will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in an office at the Instituto Dermatologico, Dominican Republic and in the PI's office at the UIC campus upon the investigator's return to Chicago. All data will be de-identified to preserve confidentiality. Names will not be recorded. Verbal informed consent will be sought; there will be no signed consent forms to identify individuals. The participants have the right to review the audio recordings. If a participant requests to listen to the recordings, one of the co-investigators will schedule an appointment for the subject to come to the research site and, in an unoccupied office, will playback the recording for him/her and answer all the questions that the subject may have. If the participant wishes to erase part or all of his/her responses, it will be done on the spot, in his/her presence, using the digital recorder. The data obtained during these FGD and interviews will inform the design of the educational materials. Once created, these materials will be tested for clarity and appropriateness of language by soliciting input from community health promoters and peer advocates working at the IDCP. Once it is determined that the educational materials are suitable to distribute to clients, we will submit to the Institutional Review Board for approval. Once approved, pamphlets and posters will be printed and distributed at the site clinics and the surrounding communities.

During the second phase, selected providers will be trained. This will include counselors in HIV counseling and testing, and medical doctors by an experienced urologist on the appropriate technique for VMMC using the ""Manual for Male Circumcision Under Local Anesthesia"" published by WHO, UNAIDS. Supervision and evaluation of trainees will be conducted following the protocol used during the parent RCT.

Study subjects will be recruited in a variety of ways. In Santo Domingo, fliers will be posted in bars and night clubs frequented by men at high risk for HIV/STI acquisition. A group of volunteer commercial sex workers working on an HIV vaccine trial will be asked to refer their clients for the study. Men seeking care for STI at the clinic will also be invited to participate. In La Romana, men attending the Clínica de Familia will be invited to participate. In addition, a group of outreach workers will visit the ""bateyes"", the communities surrounding sugar cane fields where migrant laborers live, to educate men about MC and invite them to participate in the study.

Men between 18-40 years will be provided with information about the study and will be invited to participate. If they express an interest in participating, informed consent will be obtained. The participant will go over the consent form with the counselor, who will assess his level of understanding and answer any questions. If there are no temporary or permanent excluding conditions, the participant will be asked to give informed consent for enrollment in the study. Men who elect to be circumcised will be fully informed about the benefits and risks of the procedure, as well as the surgical method to be used. After the informed consent is signed, a ""Locator Information Form"" containing confidential data such as subject's name and address will be completed. Only selected research staff will have access to this information, which will be filed separate from the rest of the study forms. A de-identified ""demographic information form and behavioral questionnaire"" will be completed next.

Testing for HIV infection will be carried out using a rapid test. The test kits to be used are the synthetic peptide test, Determine HIV 1/2, and the recombinant antigen test Unigold HIV 1/2 Recombinant. Results are provided to the clients, with appropriate counseling, at the same visit. Participants are taught to observe, read and interpret the tests for themselves in the company of the counselor. Men with positive results will be informed of their HIV status and will be followed-up at the study clinic and referred for a confirmatory HIV-ELISA and, if confirmed, for HIV treatment. Serologic testing for HSV-2, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV), and hepatitis C antibody (HCV) will be performed using an ELISA test. A serum Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR) will be performed to test for syphilis. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing will be performed in urine using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. All participants who test positive for Chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea will be offered treatment free of charge. Participants who test positive for HSV-2 and have active genital lesions will be offered treatment free of charge. Those who test positive but have no active lesions will be counseled on safe sex practices and the risk of transmission to their partners as there is no recommended treatment for asymptomatic individuals infected with HSV-2. HIV, HBV, and HCV positive participants will be referred for evaluation and treatment at Clinica de la Familia in La Romana as these are chronic diseases that require long term treatment usually covered under government programs. If a participant is found to have a treatable STD and he does not return to the site, he will be called by the study investigators using the phone number provided by the participant at enrolment to ensure treatment is provided. If there is a temporary, medically curable condition present, such that it would be advisable to defer potential surgery, then the participant will be treated and asked to return for re-evaluation for study eligibility when he is cured. Men found to have an STD or to be HIV-positive will be referred for immediate care. Once enrollment is completed, participants will be given an appointment for the surgery.

Circumcision will be performed soon after informed consent, preferably within a few days. All surgeries will be done under local anesthesia in a clinic by trained clinicians, using the standardized forceps-guided method described by Krieger and colleagues and contained in the WHO MC manual(23). Circumcised men will be counseled to refrain from sex for six weeks post-surgery and counseled about risk of HIV infection through open wounds during the healing process. They will be checked for complications and asked about their sexual activity seven days after the procedure. Men without complications will be followed six months after surgery with behavioral risk assessment, HIV testing and counseling. Men may come to the study sites for unscheduled visits at any time during the 6 month follow-up. All men will be counseled at enrollment and all follow-up visits to reduce their risk for HIV infection by consistent condom use and, where applicable, reductions in numbers of sex partners. Counselling on condom use and sexual risk reduction will be provided by trained, experienced, native-speaking counsellors.

MC services will be offered at the selected two sites for 1 year. The estimated cost per circumcision is $40. We expect to recruit five clients per week at each site for a total convenience sample of 575 subjects in one year. During the second year of the project, we will continue to assess behavioral risk factors for the first six months and work on analyzing the data during the last semester of the project.

Circumcision Procedure Prior to surgery, the clinician will obtain a complete medical history and perform a physical exam.

A brief description of the procedure follows. The patient lies on his back in a comfortable position. The pubic area is shaved clean with a disposable razor and the hair is picked up with a dressing tape. The surgeon scrubs up and puts on 2 pairs of sterile gloves. The client's skin is prepared with Betadine solution, making sure that the inner surface of the prepuce and the glans are clean and the skin is dry. The outer pair of gloves is then removed. The client is draped with two drapes and a center ""O"" towel, and then, using 2% lidocaine without epinephrine, a dorsal nerve block and a field block with special attention to the ventral nerve, is performed. Normally, no more than 10ml of 2% lidocaine will be used. The anesthetic effect of the nerve block is checked, and revised if necessary. The prepuce is held with two mosquito forceps, one on each lateral aspect, then a curved mark is made with sterile disposable marking pens, outlining the planned surgical cut. The mark is made one cm proximal to the coronal sulcus all round, and parallel to the coronal sulcus. The prepuce is clamped along the mark with a Kocher clamp while retracting the glans, ensuring that the glans itself is not clamped. The prepuce is excised using a surgical blade along the mark. Bleeders are identified, clamped and tied. They are sutured, and if necessary ligated, using 3/0 plain catgut. After ligating all the bleeders, the area is irrigated with normal saline and then inspected for more bleeders, which are identified and tied. Using 3/0 chromic catgut on a taper 4/8 circle needle, a U-shaped horizontal mattress stitch is made on the ventral side of the penis (frenulum) to join the skin at the ""V"" shaped cut, which is then tied and tagged with a mosquito forceps. Using vertical mattress stitches, four quarters are tagged, and a vertical mattress stitch added, after which a simple stitch is put at the center of every two mattress stitches (a total of at least 16 stitches). The area is irrigated with normal saline and other simple stitches added as required. The wound is dressed with Sofratulle, then with a regular dressing bandage and a strapping. The client is advised to rest for 30 minutes, and if stable, discharged home on mild analgesics. Upon completion of the procedure the surgeon completes a procedure form. The excised foreskin tissue is taken to the laboratory with no identifiers, discarded with other laboratory waste, and incinerated with other biological waste within three days. Participants will be given verbal and written instructions on postoperative wound care and counseled to refrain from sexual activity for at least six weeks after the procedure. They will also be encouraged to come to the clinic or contact a clinician at any time with medical problems.

Day 7 Post Circumcision Visit: Circumcised men will be asked to return to the clinic 7 days after the procedure to check the wound, to see if it is healing properly, to check for complications, and to ask about their sexual activity, their level of pain, resumption of work or other activities, and their satisfaction with the procedure and care at the clinic. As with all visits, any adverse events will be recorded. Blood and urine will be collected for STD testing at this visit.

Six month post operative visit: During this visit a brief exam to confirmed proper wound healing will be performed. A behavioral and satisfaction questionnaire will be administered.

Unscheduled Follow-up Visits: Ad hoc clinic visits will be encouraged to check and treat for complications of the procedure. At such visits, medical examinations and laboratory testing will be conducted as indicated, and appropriate treatment provided free of charge. Medical referral will be made if required.

d.2. Data analysis Each enrolled participant will be assigned a confidential code, which will be used in all study forms. Only the principal investigators and research assistants will have access to the ""locator information form"" containing personal information. This form, which links the subject's confidential code to his name, will be stored in separate locked filing cabinets at the local principal investigator's offices. The locator information forms, which contain the personal information on the subjects, will be kept for 1.5 years in case we need to contact one of the subjects for an unexpected occurrence or with a question. After the end of that period, these locator forms will be destroyed at the research offices at the respective study sites using a micro cut shredder. Data will be coded and entered into computer datasets by trained personnel. Data extracted from questionnaires will be tabulated and analyzed using SAS statistical software version 9.1. and will be analyzed at the University of Illinois, College of Medicine, in Chicago by the principal investigator A questionnaire asking specific demographic information will be administered. The following variables will be recorded: age, religion, place of residence (urban/rural), education level, occupation and marital status. Simple descriptive statistics will be calculated and the effect of these variables on the willingness, uptake and rate of adverse events of VMMC will be estimated. In addition, we plan to estimate the effect of demographic characteristics on sexual behavior and disinhibition after the procedure.","Inclusion Criteria:

Voluntary Medical Male circumcision (VMMC) is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. Observational data and randomized controlled trails (RCTs) conducted in Africa(1,2,3) suggest that the procedure reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by 50-76% in heterosexual males. VMMC has also been shown to reduce the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections (STI), including herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papilloma virus (HPV) in men(4), and Chlamydia(5), trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and HPV in their female partners(6). The results of the RCT's are generating increased demand for safe and affordable MC services in areas of moderate-to-high HIV prevalence where the MC rates are low. Latin America is a region where circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic (DR), which is the focus of this study, a 2007 nationwide household survey found that only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 were circumcised(8). AIDS is the leading cause of death in the Caribbean basin among adults aged 15-44 years. There are approximately 240,000 people currently living with the disease, most of them residing in the Dominican Republic (DR) and Haiti(9). The prevalence of HIV infection in the DR is approximately 0.8% nationwide(8) but it is higher in selected high-risk populations, such as among people living in the ""bateyes"", the small towns surrounding sugar cane plantations, where the prevalence is 3.2%(10). In pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the Altagracia province HIV seroprevalence is 4.5 %(11). One of the areas of highest prevalence (1.2%) in the country is Region V of health, which includes the provinces of La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, La Romana and San Pedro de Macorís. Prevalence is also higher in the urban slums of the capital city, Santo Domingo. The public health impact of introducing MC as a strategy to prevent HIV/STI transmission in areas of high HIV/STI prevalence and low MC rates can be significant. In addition to decreasing the rates of HIV and other STI, the intervention could indirectly help decrease the rates of HPV associated cervical cancer. The study proposed here is to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate pilot MC services in selected sites to assess the acceptability, uptake, safety and demand for these services, and to use these data to develop, in collaboration with the Dominican Ministry of Health (MoH), a proposal to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for support of operations research concerning the safety, uptake, and efficacy of MC interventions in the DR. 1. Specific Aims: Based on the results of numerous observational studies and the three RCTs the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have endorsed VMMC as a biomedical intervention for HIV prevention. As such, countries with a high prevalence of HIV in the population are encouraged to examine the feasibility of offering MC services as part of the portfolio of HIV prevention strategies at a national level. The specific aims for this project are: 1. To develop culturally appropriate education materials about the benefits of VMMC for clients attending pilot healthcare centers. 2. To train a core group of providers on proper surgical and counseling techniques to provide comprehensive VMMC services. 3. To determine the acceptability, uptake and demand for MC services in key areas of high HIV prevalence. H1: The acceptability and uptake among high risk men will be around 60%. 4. To assess the safety and adverse events of performing circumcision in resource constrained settings. H2: VMMC will result in a complication rate of less than 2%. 5. To assess sexual risk behaviors, perceptions of sexual function and sexual pleasure in men before and after VMMC. H3: there will be no differences in risk behaviors, sexual function and pleasure after VMMC. 6. Estimate point prevalence of most common STI in a subset of circumcised men and preserve a small sample of blood to test future scientific hypothesis and/or newer testing techniques as they become available. 7. To build collaborations with the MoH and other partners in the DR and at UIC to develop a proposal to NIMH for operational research in the context of larger scale MC service provision. 2. Background and significance: b.1. Male Circumcision to Prevent HIV Transmission Male circumcision is perhaps one of the oldest surgical procedures performed on humans. The millenary practice of removing the male foreskin has cultural, religious and medical dimensions that have been widely studied. Around the world, the procedure is mostly performed for religious reasons in persons of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Medical indications for MC include phimosis, paraphimosis and balanitis, among others(12). Early evidence of a relationship between MC and HIV infection came from a number of smaller, mostly observational studies, done in Africa(13). These historical data were validated with the completion of three large RCTs in South Africa, Kenya and Uganda, which have shown an overall decrease of 50-76% in the risk of acquiring HIV infection in circumcised males when compared to controls(1,2,3). The pathogenesis of the initial infection at the level of the foreskin involves tissue macrophages, cell receptors and a moist, poorly keratinized inner prepuce. The first cellular target of the HIV virion on the human genitalia are the tissue dendritic cells in the lamina propria of the submucosa(14). These cells express surface CD4 receptors and CCR5 co-receptors for which HIV has high affinity. In intact human skin, the dendritic cells are shielded from the outer environment by the relatively thick layer of keratin covering the surface of the epithelia. Tissue studies of the human foreskin have shown that the inner lining of the prepuce, exposed during a penile erection, has a thin keratin layer that is very susceptible to microscopic abrasions and can expose the tissue macrophages making them vulnerable to infection by HIV(15). b.2. MC for STI prevention: MC is an effective strategy to decrease the risk of infection with HIV and other STI in heterosexual males. A beneficial effect has also been observed in decreasing the risk of STI in females. The RCTs confirmed that VMMC decreases herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) acquisition by 29%, and HPV prevalence by 34% in men(4). Among female partners of circumcised men, bacterial vaginosis was reduced by 40%, and trichomonas vaginalis infection was reduced by 48%(6). Genital ulcer disease was also reduced among males and their female partners by approximately half(16). b.3. HIV in the Caribbean and the Dominican Republic: The significant decrease in the rate of HIV acquisition observed among circumcised males who participated in the African RCT is generating an increased demand for safe and affordable VMMC services in areas of high HIV prevalence where the procedure is not routinely performed. Latin America is one of such areas where routine circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic, only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 years are circumcised(8). The Caribbean is the region of the world with the highest HIV prevalence outside of sub-Saharan Africa (1.0%)(9). Approximately 240,000 individuals are currently living with the disease. Among the Caribbean countries, the Dominican Republic and Haiti report the highest prevalence in the region. According to data from a recent In the DR, the prevalence of HIV infection is 0.8% nationwide(8), however, the numbers are higher in selected populations and in certain geographic locations. The Dominican healthcare system is administratively divided in 9 regions, which include the country's 31 provinces. Region 0 of health includes the National District and the provinces of Santo Domingo and Monte Plata. The city of Santo Domingo is the capital and financial center of the DR. It has an estimated population of 2.7 million people spread in an area of about 1,400 KM2. 90% of the population lives in an urban setting in this province(17). The overall prevalence of HIV is around 0.7 % in the entire region but is higher in vulnerable groups such as commercial sex workers (CSW) (3.3%), Men who Have Sex with Men (MSM) (5.9%) and drug users (7.1%)(18). Regions V and VII report the highest prevalence of HIV in the country, 1.2 % and 1.5% respectively(8). Specific populations within these provinces have rates of HIV considerably higher than the national average. For instance, prevalence is 3.2% in the bateyes, the small communities surrounding sugar cane plantations, where a mixed population of Dominicans and Haitian migrant workers cohabitate. Our team has conducted preliminary studies in the Altagracia Province, part of Region V, since it reports the highest province-specific HIV rates and the lowest circumcision rates in the country. A survey of pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the province found an HIV seroprevalence of 4.5 %11. The prevalence of HIV is 5.2% in CSW, 7.6% in MSM and 8.5 % among drug users(18). c) Preliminary studies: The parent study for this project is a RCT of VMMC to reduce HIV incidence in Kisumu, Kenya whose principal investigator is Prof. Robert C. Bailey, a co-investigator in the current proposal(3). The main objective of that trial was to assess the effectiveness of VMMC in reducing HIV incidence in young, sexually active men. The protective effect found in an intent-to-treat analysis was 53% and in an as treated analysis adjusting for cross-overs and men found to be HIV seropositive at baseline estimated the protective effect to be 60%. Adverse events related to the surgical procedure were few, just 1.5%. Behavioral disinhibition (risk compensation) on the part of circumcised men was small and not significant. Drs. Brito and Bailey conducted a feasibility study of healthcare facilities in the Altagracia province in the Dominican Republic during June and July of 2007. A total of 37 healthcare facilities were surveyed. The study found that most facilities lacked appropriate equipment to perform surgical procedures and only four (11%) had a surgical theater. 43 healthcare workers, the majority of them physicians (91%), were interviewed for the study. Only 23 % of the personnel had experience performing MC and a significant number of providers (76%) believed they needed comprehensive training in the procedure prior to starting a MC program. Quantitative and qualitative studies to assess the acceptability of MC among men, women and providers in the Altagracia Province were conducted in 2008. In these studies, 73% of men thought that MC improved hygiene and approximately one third knew that it reduces the risk of penile cancer or STI. Only a small percentage (21%) knew that MC helps prevent HIV infection. When first asked, 29% of participants reported that they would be willing to be circumcised if the procedure was offered to them. However, after an educational session detailing the benefits of the procedure for HIV and STI prevention, the acceptability increased to 67%. Such increment was also observed in previous studies done in Botswana(19) and Thailand(20)where acceptability increased from 61 % to 81% and from 14% to 66%, respectively, after a similar information session. In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of men's acceptability of circumcision, before the information session, were Haitian nationality (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.41), thinking that circumcision improves hygiene (OR=2.78, 95% CI 1.29-6.0) and not believing that having a circumcision decreases sexual pleasure (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.20-3.94). These results have been published (21, 22). We also conducted 13 focus group discussions (FGD), 6 with women and 7 with men, each consisting of 6-10 participants (mean=7.9, SD=1.3). One additional FGD was conducted with six physicians, two males and four females, working in rural clinics around the province. Findings of this qualitative study showed that a significant number of participants might be willing to be circumcised, or agree with circumcision for their partners, to improve hygiene, prevent diseases and treat medical conditions, such as phimosis, which can result in pain during intercourse. These results are consistent with our quantitative study on men's acceptability of MC. Perhaps one of the most important findings of the FGD was the enthusiastic endorsement of MC by women, a fact that has potential implications for the successful implementation of a circumcision program in the country (22). Overall, our preliminary data suggest that men are willing to be circumcised provided they receive information about the benefits of the procedure. Before recommending the introduction of VMMC services as part of a comprehensive package of HIV and other STI prevention strategies, these findings need to be confirmed by studying the uptake of VMMC among sexually active men in selected clinics that serve clients in high prevalence areas. In addition, there is need to identify potential barriers to offering MC services in high risk communities prior to proposing to implement a large-scale intervention. In order to properly address these concerns, we will conduct a pilot study that will provide the necessary preliminary data to design a proposal to the NIMH to conduct operational research around a large-scale implementation project. d) Experimental design and methods: d.1. Pilot study design The study will be conducted at two sites: the STI clinic at Instituto Dermatologico and Cirugia de Piel (IDCP) in Santo Domingo and the Clínica de Familia in La Romana, Dominican Republic. These sites have been selected on the basis of: 1) high numbers of male clients at risk for HIV and STI infection in communities served by the clinics; 2) high level of acceptability of MC among men in the communities served by the clinics (bateyes of Altagracia); 3) the availability of service providers willing to be trained; 4) the availability of equipment; and 5) the availability of infrastructure, including a minor surgical theater, sterilization facilities and HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and STI management. During the first phase of the study, culturally appropriate educational material will be created in Spanish by the principal investigator and local collaborators. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews will be conducted with members of the community to learn the educational needs of the community and to assess their opinions on how to best deliver the information on MC that will be contained in the educational materials. We plan to conduct the FGD in the communities served by the Instituto Dermatologico and the Clinica de Familia, the two main study sites. The plan is to assemble groups of 6-12 participants from the population living in these communities. Community leaders, health promoters, teachers and primary care physicians will be asked to help identify and invite volunteers from their respective communities to participate in the study. There will be no difference in the recruitment process for men and women. They will be recruited from the same venues (schools, clubs, community centers) . Participants will be invited to participate by research personnel with the help of local leaders. These local leaders may be of both genders and will help recruit participants from either gender. The focus groups will be gender-specific. The moderator will explain the purpose of the study to participants. Verbal consent will be obtained from all participants and an information sheet outlining the objectives of the study, their privacy and confidentiality rights and our contact information will be distributed. The document will highlight the voluntary nature of the subject's participation and their right to leave the discussion at anytime if they so desire. The study meets the definition of ""minimal risk"", therefore, we are requesting a waiver of written consent. We believe this will further preserve the confidentiality of the participants. The goal is to conduct no more than 15 FGD. Participants in the FGD will be divided by gender. We plan to recruit approximately the same number of men and women for the FGD. In addition to the FGD, several in-depth individual interviews may be conducted using the same guide than in the FGD. A script will be followed to conduct the FGD. The discussions will be stimulated by using a list of carefully crafted questions on the subject of MC. These questions are designed to obtain information on the following aspects relevant to our investigation: 1. Perception of the population about the frequency of MC in community men. 2. Opinions on the best way to educate men in the community about the benefits of circumcision. 3. Opinions about the content of the educational materials educational and how information should be delivered. 4. Where should these educational material be posted or distributed to capture the most number of men. 5. Opinions on the best venue to organize educational sessions featuring a circumcised man that would be available to answer question from men in the community about his satisfaction with his circumcision. 6. Perceptions about who would be a good person to educate men about the benefits of circumcision in the community. 7. Opinions on the best way to involve women in the community in a campaign to recruit men for circumcision. The moderator and a research assistant (RA) will lead the discussions. All FGD will be audiotaped and detailed notes will be taken. The content of the recordings will be transcribed shortly after the end of the meeting. The PI, a native Spanish speaker, will be responsible for translating the recordings from Spanish to English. The English-version transcripts will be coded using the program ATLAS.ti vers. 5.2 based on template of topical categories drawn from questions and issues covered in the discussion guides and from themes emerging from the discussions themselves. The interviews will be conducted by one of the co-investigators. Verbal consent will be obtained and a document containing information about the study will be provided to the participants. All data obtained during this study, including recordings and notes will be de-indentified. The names of the participants will not be recorded to protect their confidentiality. Data Management All notes, audio recordings and study material obtained during the FGD and interviews will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in an office at the Instituto Dermatologico, Dominican Republic and in the PI's office at the UIC campus upon the investigator's return to Chicago. All data will be de-identified to preserve confidentiality. Names will not be recorded. Verbal informed consent will be sought; there will be no signed consent forms to identify individuals. The participants have the right to review the audio recordings. If a participant requests to listen to the recordings, one of the co-investigators will schedule an appointment for the subject to come to the research site and, in an unoccupied office, will playback the recording for him/her and answer all the questions that the subject may have. If the participant wishes to erase part or all of his/her responses, it will be done on the spot, in his/her presence, using the digital recorder. The data obtained during these FGD and interviews will inform the design of the educational materials. Once created, these materials will be tested for clarity and appropriateness of language by soliciting input from community health promoters and peer advocates working at the IDCP. Once it is determined that the educational materials are suitable to distribute to clients, we will submit to the Institutional Review Board for approval. Once approved, pamphlets and posters will be printed and distributed at the site clinics and the surrounding communities. During the second phase, selected providers will be trained. This will include counselors in HIV counseling and testing, and medical doctors by an experienced urologist on the appropriate technique for VMMC using the ""Manual for Male Circumcision Under Local Anesthesia"" published by WHO, UNAIDS. Supervision and evaluation of trainees will be conducted following the protocol used during the parent RCT. Study subjects will be recruited in a variety of ways. In Santo Domingo, fliers will be posted in bars and night clubs frequented by men at high risk for HIV/STI acquisition. A group of volunteer commercial sex workers working on an HIV vaccine trial will be asked to refer their clients for the study. Men seeking care for STI at the clinic will also be invited to participate. In La Romana, men attending the Clínica de Familia will be invited to participate. In addition, a group of outreach workers will visit the ""bateyes"", the communities surrounding sugar cane fields where migrant laborers live, to educate men about MC and invite them to participate in the study. Men between 18-40 years will be provided with information about the study and will be invited to participate. If they express an interest in participating, informed consent will be obtained. The participant will go over the consent form with the counselor, who will assess his level of understanding and answer any questions. If there are no temporary or permanent excluding conditions, the participant will be asked to give informed consent for enrollment in the study. Men who elect to be circumcised will be fully informed about the benefits and risks of the procedure, as well as the surgical method to be used. After the informed consent is signed, a ""Locator Information Form"" containing confidential data such as subject's name and address will be completed. Only selected research staff will have access to this information, which will be filed separate from the rest of the study forms. A de-identified ""demographic information form and behavioral questionnaire"" will be completed next. Testing for HIV infection will be carried out using a rapid test. The test kits to be used are the synthetic peptide test, Determine HIV 1/2, and the recombinant antigen test Unigold HIV 1/2 Recombinant. Results are provided to the clients, with appropriate counseling, at the same visit. Participants are taught to observe, read and interpret the tests for themselves in the company of the counselor. Men with positive results will be informed of their HIV status and will be followed-up at the study clinic and referred for a confirmatory HIV-ELISA and, if confirmed, for HIV treatment. Serologic testing for HSV-2, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV), and hepatitis C antibody (HCV) will be performed using an ELISA test. A serum Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR) will be performed to test for syphilis. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing will be performed in urine using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. All participants who test positive for Chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea will be offered treatment free of charge. Participants who test positive for HSV-2 and have active genital lesions will be offered treatment free of charge. Those who test positive but have no active lesions will be counseled on safe sex practices and the risk of transmission to their partners as there is no recommended treatment for asymptomatic individuals infected with HSV-2. HIV, HBV, and HCV positive participants will be referred for evaluation and treatment at Clinica de la Familia in La Romana as these are chronic diseases that require long term treatment usually covered under government programs. If a participant is found to have a treatable STD and he does not return to the site, he will be called by the study investigators using the phone number provided by the participant at enrolment to ensure treatment is provided. If there is a temporary, medically curable condition present, such that it would be advisable to defer potential surgery, then the participant will be treated and asked to return for re-evaluation for study eligibility when he is cured. Men found to have an STD or to be HIV-positive will be referred for immediate care. Once enrollment is completed, participants will be given an appointment for the surgery. Circumcision will be performed soon after informed consent, preferably within a few days. All surgeries will be done under local anesthesia in a clinic by trained clinicians, using the standardized forceps-guided method described by Krieger and colleagues and contained in the WHO MC manual(23). Circumcised men will be counseled to refrain from sex for six weeks post-surgery and counseled about risk of HIV infection through open wounds during the healing process. They will be checked for complications and asked about their sexual activity seven days after the procedure. Men without complications will be followed six months after surgery with behavioral risk assessment, HIV testing and counseling. Men may come to the study sites for unscheduled visits at any time during the 6 month follow-up. All men will be counseled at enrollment and all follow-up visits to reduce their risk for HIV infection by consistent condom use and, where applicable, reductions in numbers of sex partners. Counselling on condom use and sexual risk reduction will be provided by trained, experienced, native-speaking counsellors. MC services will be offered at the selected two sites for 1 year. The estimated cost per circumcision is $40. We expect to recruit five clients per week at each site for a total convenience sample of 575 subjects in one year. During the second year of the project, we will continue to assess behavioral risk factors for the first six months and work on analyzing the data during the last semester of the project. Circumcision Procedure Prior to surgery, the clinician will obtain a complete medical history and perform a physical exam. A brief description of the procedure follows. The patient lies on his back in a comfortable position. The pubic area is shaved clean with a disposable razor and the hair is picked up with a dressing tape. The surgeon scrubs up and puts on 2 pairs of sterile gloves. The client's skin is prepared with Betadine solution, making sure that the inner surface of the prepuce and the glans are clean and the skin is dry. The outer pair of gloves is then removed. The client is draped with two drapes and a center ""O"" towel, and then, using 2% lidocaine without epinephrine, a dorsal nerve block and a field block with special attention to the ventral nerve, is performed. Normally, no more than 10ml of 2% lidocaine will be used. The anesthetic effect of the nerve block is checked, and revised if necessary. The prepuce is held with two mosquito forceps, one on each lateral aspect, then a curved mark is made with sterile disposable marking pens, outlining the planned surgical cut. The mark is made one cm proximal to the coronal sulcus all round, and parallel to the coronal sulcus. The prepuce is clamped along the mark with a Kocher clamp while retracting the glans, ensuring that the glans itself is not clamped. The prepuce is excised using a surgical blade along the mark. Bleeders are identified, clamped and tied. They are sutured, and if necessary ligated, using 3/0 plain catgut. After ligating all the bleeders, the area is irrigated with normal saline and then inspected for more bleeders, which are identified and tied. Using 3/0 chromic catgut on a taper 4/8 circle needle, a U-shaped horizontal mattress stitch is made on the ventral side of the penis (frenulum) to join the skin at the ""V"" shaped cut, which is then tied and tagged with a mosquito forceps. Using vertical mattress stitches, four quarters are tagged, and a vertical mattress stitch added, after which a simple stitch is put at the center of every two mattress stitches (a total of at least 16 stitches). The area is irrigated with normal saline and other simple stitches added as required. The wound is dressed with Sofratulle, then with a regular dressing bandage and a strapping. The client is advised to rest for 30 minutes, and if stable, discharged home on mild analgesics. Upon completion of the procedure the surgeon completes a procedure form. The excised foreskin tissue is taken to the laboratory with no identifiers, discarded with other laboratory waste, and incinerated with other biological waste within three days. Participants will be given verbal and written instructions on postoperative wound care and counseled to refrain from sexual activity for at least six weeks after the procedure. They will also be encouraged to come to the clinic or contact a clinician at any time with medical problems. Day 7 Post Circumcision Visit: Circumcised men will be asked to return to the clinic 7 days after the procedure to check the wound, to see if it is healing properly, to check for complications, and to ask about their sexual activity, their level of pain, resumption of work or other activities, and their satisfaction with the procedure and care at the clinic. As with all visits, any adverse events will be recorded. Blood and urine will be collected for STD testing at this visit. Six month post operative visit: During this visit a brief exam to confirmed proper wound healing will be performed. A behavioral and satisfaction questionnaire will be administered. Unscheduled Follow-up Visits: Ad hoc clinic visits will be encouraged to check and treat for complications of the procedure. At such visits, medical examinations and laboratory testing will be conducted as indicated, and appropriate treatment provided free of charge. Medical referral will be made if required. d.2. Data analysis Each enrolled participant will be assigned a confidential code, which will be used in all study forms. Only the principal investigators and research assistants will have access to the ""locator information form"" containing personal information. This form, which links the subject's confidential code to his name, will be stored in separate locked filing cabinets at the local principal investigator's offices. The locator information forms, which contain the personal information on the subjects, will be kept for 1.5 years in case we need to contact one of the subjects for an unexpected occurrence or with a question. After the end of that period, these locator forms will be destroyed at the research offices at the respective study sites using a micro cut shredder. Data will be coded and entered into computer datasets by trained personnel. Data extracted from questionnaires will be tabulated and analyzed using SAS statistical software version 9.1. and will be analyzed at the University of Illinois, College of Medicine, in Chicago by the principal investigator A questionnaire asking specific demographic information will be administered. The following variables will be recorded: age, religion, place of residence (urban/rural), education level, occupation and marital status. Simple descriptive statistics will be calculated and the effect of these variables on the willingness, uptake and rate of adverse events of VMMC will be estimated. In addition, we plan to estimate the effect of demographic characteristics on sexual behavior and disinhibition after the procedure. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Uncircumcised men; 2. Aged 18-40 years Exclusion Criteria: 1. Foreskin covering less than half of the glans; 2. Bleeding disorders; 3. Keloid formation; 4. Other conditions that might unduly increase the risks of elective surgery."

People with hypochondriasis believe that real or imagined physical symptoms are signs of serious illnesses, despite medical reassurance and other evidence to the contrary. Symptoms of the disorder include a preoccupation with fear of an illness; a persistent fear of having a serious illness, despite medical reassurance; and misinterpretation of symptoms. Some individuals with hypochondriasis recognize that their fear of having a serious illness may be excessive, unreasonable, or unfounded. Episodes of hypochondriasis usually last from months to years, with equally long periods of remission. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the antidepressant drug fluoxetine (FLX) have both been shown to be effective treatments for hypochondriasis. However, the relative efficacy of a combined approach has yet to be determined. This study will compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medication, and a combination of the two for treating hypochondriasis.

Participants in this double-blind study will first report to the study site for two sessions to determine eligibility for participation. Eligible individuals will then be randomly assigned to receive one of the following four treatments for 12 weeks: CBT only; FLX only; CBT plus FLX; or a placebo pill. All participants receiving medication will also receive supportive therapy.

UC is a disease of unknown cause characterised by inflammation of the lining of the large intestine and manifesting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. TOP1288 given rectally has a local anti-inflammatory action in experimental models of UC.

A Phase I placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of TOP1288 conducted in 61 healthy volunteers demonstrated that rectal administration of TOP1288 at doses up to 200 mg BID for 4 days was safe and well tolerated, with minimal systemic absorption. TOP1288 200 mg, administered once daily, therefore offers the potential for a safe and effective novel approach to treating patients with this serious condition.

This Phase 2a proof-of-concept study will evaluate the 200 mg daily dose of TOP1288, based on its favourable tolerability in the Phase 1 study. It will be administered as TOP1288 200 mg Rectal Solution compared against Placebo Rectal Solution, which contains all non-active excipients present in the active solution. This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study designed to evaluate the safety/tolerability and efficacy of TOP1288 200 mg Rectal Solution following once-daily bedtime treatment for 4 consecutive weeks. The study will include approximately 40 sites in Europe. Randomization to study treatment will be 2:1, with approximately 40 subjects randomised to TOP1288 and approximately 20 subjects randomised to placebo.

This varies in form and intensity based on when and where it occurs and what vaccine is involved. Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently available. As the world is beginning the roll-out the first approved vaccines, little is known about people's potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine in most of the African countries. ACHES (African COVID -19Vaccine Hesitancy) is an observational study aimed at measuring COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in five west African countries and exploring causes behind the hesitancy with the main objective of informing guidelines for the proficient roll-out of the vaccines in the region.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Although African countries seem to have weathered the pandemic relatively well so far, with fewer than one confirmed case for every thousand people and around 50,000 death, the African continent has now officially over two million- COVID-19- case threshold.

In 2015, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization defined vaccine hesitancy as a 'delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services', which can vary in form and intensity based on when and where it occurs and what vaccine is involved. Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently in development. As the world is beginning the roll-out the first approved vaccines, little is known about people's potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine in most of the African countries. A recent study published in Nature provides results on the acceptability of vaccines in 19 of the 35 hardest hit countries worldwide. South Africa was the only African country included in the survey. An additional survey conducted in 15 African countries between August and December 2020, reveals that the majority of Africans would take a safe and effective vaccine. Nevertheless, vaccine hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines evolves over-time. In this view, it is crucial to investigate in depth barriers and facilitators influencing vaccine hesitancy/acceptability within African population.

During the last decade several initiatives have emerged that aim at improving vaccine coverage and acceptability across the African continent. A noteworthy example is the Francophone African Civil Society Organizations' Platform for Strengthening Health Systems and Immunization, which has been since 2015 supported by GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation). OAFRESS encourages activities among francophone African members, with the primary objective of reinforcing capacities and coordinating strategies among these countries. The last West African Ebola epidemic demonstrated the importance of engaging communities in order to promote vaccine acceptability. The three most hit countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, worked together and invested in research and campaigns to identify and address barriers and facilitators of vaccine acceptance, which informed both clinical vaccine studies and roll-out strategies.

In order to promote the equitable and prompt roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, as the COVAX initiative strives for, factors influencing vaccine hesitancy in low and middle-income countries need to be investigated more thoroughly. The request for a first roll-out of the vaccines in eligible countries was to be submitted by December 7, 2020. Many of the eligible African countries have placed the order to receive the vaccines, which are already being deployed within these first months of 2021. Country and population preparedness are crucial to making the roll-out a success.

"University of Lagos, Nigeria",OTHER,NCT04976179,Iron Infusion Into a Vein Compared to Iron Tablet Taken by Mouth for Treating Iron Deficiency Anemia in Pregnancy (IVON),"Intravenous Versus Oral Iron for Iron Deficiency Anaemia in Pregnant Nigerian Women (IVON): an Open Label, Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Anaemia in pregnancy is a public health burden with high incidence in Africa. Currently high dose oral iron is recommended for treatment of mild to moderate anaemia and blood transfusion for severe anaemia. The high dose oral iron is often poorly tolerated and associated with several side effects. Various parenteral iron preparations are now available for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). The earliest of these, iron dextran is not commonly used because of its potential to cause anaphylactic reactions. Newer preparations have been found to be safer and their use for treatment of IDA is currently being evaluated.

Objective: This study sought out to compare the effectiveness of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (intervention) versus oral ferrous sulphate (control) for treating IDA in pregnancy and to compare the tolerability, safety and the cost-effectiveness of intravenous versus oral iron among pregnant Nigerian women with moderate and severe IDA at 20-32 weeks' gestation.

Methodology: This study will be a hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation design. 1056 eligible and consenting pregnant women with anaemia at 20 - 32 weeks gestation will be recruited. They will be randomized into either of 2 groups. Group A will have intravenous ferric carboxymaltose 20mg/kg to a maximum of 1000mg in 200mls of normal saline infusion over 15 - 20 minutes at enrolment. Group B will have oral ferrous sulphate 200mg (65mg elemental iron) thrice daily from enrolment till delivery. They will be followed up through delivery and until 6 weeks post partum. Their haemoglobin concentration, full blood count, serum ferritin and serum transferrin will be assayed at specific intervals using standard laboratory techniques. Depression will be assessed at each visit using Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale. Cost effectiveness analysis will also be done at each visit. The primary outcome measure will be incidence of maternal anaemia and rise in haemoglobin level. Secondary outcome measures will include safety and tolerability of trial drugs, severe maternal events, incidence of infant low birth weight and incidence of depression. Statistical analysis will be done using STATA version 16.0 statistical software (STATACorp, Texas, USA).","1.0 INTRODUCTION Anemia in pregnancy (AIP) remains a critical global health problem especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), affecting 46% of pregnant women in Africa and 49% in Asia. AIP is defined as a venous blood hemoglobin concentration of \<11 g/dl in a pregnant woman. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the commonest cause of AIP, accounting for 50-75% of AIP. Antenatal maternal anemia has significant implications on both maternal and neonatal outcomes, including maternal mortality from hemorrhage and morbidity from infections, and neonatal low birth weight and prematurity. It has also been associated with an increased risk of depression.

In most LMICs, including Nigeria, routine treatment of IDA in pregnancy is with oral iron preparations, due to fears of serious adverse reactions from parenteral iron, including anaphylaxis, and the belief that oral iron is equally effective. Parenteral, especially intravenous, iron is also more expensive, and it is not clear whether its benefits are worth the cost. In settings like Nigeria, where most people still pay out-of-pocket for healthcare, cost effectiveness is particularly important. However, apart from the side effects caused by oral iron, it also takes longer to correct the anemia, and in cases where patients are unable to absorb iron, oral intake is rendered ineffective. Reservations on use of parenteral iron have been due largely to experience with high molecular weight iron dextran preparations, which had a relatively high incidence of anaphylactic reactions. Fortunately, there are now several safe parenteral iron preparations, such as iron sucrose, iron polymaltose, ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and iron isomaltoside.

2.0 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Aims: To determine the comparative effectiveness of intravenous FCM (intervention) versus oral ferrous sulphate (control) for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy and to compare the tolerability, safety, and the cost-effectiveness of intravenous versus oral iron among pregnant Nigerian women with moderate and severe IDA at 20-32 weeks' gestation. It also aims to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of use of intravenous FCM for treating IDA.

Objectives

1. To determine effect of intravenous FCM on the prevalence of maternal anemia at 36 weeks' gestation and on increase in hemoglobin concentration 4 weeks after administration, compared with oral ferrous sulphate (FS) in pregnant women with IDA.
2. To determine effect of intravenous FCM on incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, sepsis, shock, need for blood transfusion, prevalence of depression and other maternal clinical outcomes, compared with oral FS in pregnant women with IDA.
3. To determine effect of intravenous FCM on the incidence of low infant birthweight, prematurity, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality, and on breastfeeding and immunization, compared with use of oral FS in pregnant women with IDA.
4. To measure implementation outcomes of intravenous FCM including its acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity in the context in which the trial is being carried out.
5. To determine cost-effectiveness of intravenous FCM compared with oral FS in treatment of IDA in pregnancy.

3.0 STUDY DESIGN: This study is a multicenter, parallel, open label, individually randomized controlled trial, with women allocated in a 1:1 ratio in conjunction with a cost-effectiveness analysis.

3.1 Study setting and site selection: The study will be implemented in two most populated states in Nigeria; Kano State in North-West and Lagos State in South-West zone. One tertiary, two secondary and two primary healthcare facilities have been purposively selected from each state, making 10 targeted facilities based on antenatal patient flow, number of deliveries and proximity of all three levels of care to facilitate an effective two-way referral system.

3.2 Sample size calculations: At 5% significance and precision level, 1,056 pregnant women (528 in each study arm) are required to detect a difference in improvement in prevalence of AIP at term by 14%, between control group (70% corrected) and intervention group (84% corrected), as seen in a multi-country international study in Europe, Asia, and Australia (30) at 90% power, adjusting for 15% attrition and protocol violations (31).

3.3 Randomization: At enrolment, eligible participants will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups using a web-based randomization software known as 'Sealed envelope' in a 1:1 ratio in blocks stratified according to center.

3.4 Study intervention: Eligible pregnant women randomized to intervention arm (FCM) will be admitted on a day care basis for treatment initiation and will be given intravenous FCM in a single dose of 20mg/kg up to a maximum of 1000mg in 200 ml 0.9% sodium chloride infusion over a minimum of 15 - 20 minutes. Thereafter, they will be observed for a minimum of 30 minutes before being allowed to go home.

The pregnant women randomized to the control arm (FS) will be given one 200mg tablet of ferrous sulphate containing 65mg of elemental iron, three times daily till 6 weeks post-delivery. The women will be sent daily reminders by text messages, questioned on compliance at each visit and asked to bring in their empty sachets for sighting and pill count.

After delivery, all study participants will be tested for anemia with Hemocue before discharge. Those with hemoglobin concentration less than 11g/dl will be treated as per standard practice i.e., with FS 200mg tds, vitamin C 100mg tds and folic acid 5mg daily.

All study participants in both arms will receive 5mg folic acid daily, vitamin C 100mg tds, and followed from enrollment till delivery and for 6 weeks post-partum. They will be seen 4-weekly till 28 weeks, 2 weekly till 36 weeks and weekly till delivery and then at 2, 4 and 6 weeks postpartum.

3.5 Malaria Treatment and Prevention: Participants will be screened at enrolment for malaria parasitemia with SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f and treated with Artemisinin based combination therapy if positive for malaria parasite. Thereafter, intermittent preventive treatment for malaria will be administered with three doses of three tablets of Sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (500/25) monthly except if patient is allergic to sulphonamides, in which case, patient will be placed on monthly artemisinin-lumefantrine (treatment dose). All pregnant women will also be given long lasting insecticide treated bed nets and counseled on usage.

3.6 Physical examination: Full physical examinations will be performed at baseline, and at each visit. The initial evaluation will also include measurement of patient's weight and blood pressure.

3.7 Laboratory evaluations: These will include:

* Full blood count at enrollment, 4 weeks post enrollment, 36 weeks' gestation, day of delivery and 6 weeks' postpartum.
* Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) with SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f at enrolment and if symptomatic for malaria at any time.
* Hemoglobin concentration with the Hemocue haemoglobinometer at enrolment and every study visit. The first will be used for enrollment.
* Iron profile: This will comprise serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation at 4 weeks post enrollment, 36 weeks' gestation, day of delivery and 6 weeks postpartum. Only serum ferritin will be done at enrolment.
* Serum phosphate: maternal phosphate level at enrollment, 4 weeks post enrollment, on day of delivery and 6 weeks postpartum; and cord blood phosphate on day of delivery.

All samples aside point of care tests (POCT) will be analyzed at Synlab (an internationally accredited medical laboratory).

3.9 Visit schedules and assessments

* The participants' subsequent clinic visits will be scheduled to hold every 4 weeks till 28 weeks' gestation and every 2 weeks till 36 weeks, then weekly until delivery. Thereafter, they will be seen at 2, 4 and 6 weeks postpartum. Reminders on appointments will be sent by SMS to all participants 24 hours before scheduled visit.
* Women diagnosed as having depression using Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) will be referred to a psychiatrist for further management.

4.0 DATA ANALYSIS PLAN Data analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. For continuous variables, a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality will be performed, and normally distributed data will be presented as means ± SD, while non-normally distributed data will be presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The risk of occurrence of IUGR, perinatal death and other key outcome variables will be computed and compared in both groups. A multivariate regression analysis will be performed to determine the odds of each of the key outcomes among women who received the intervention with respect to those who did not, after controlling for common confounders. This will be presented as regression coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. Level of significance will be set at 5%. Post-regression analysis will be performed to determine the goodness-of-fit of the final model. STATA version15.0 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA) will be used for statistical analysis.

5.0 MONITORING PLAN - There will also be a Steering committee, Clinical Trial Monitors, and a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).

University of Virginia,OTHER,NCT02058979,Pharmacokinetics of Bolus Versus Continuous Cefazolin Infusion in Patients Undergoing Major Surgery,Pharmacokinetics of Bolus Versus Continuous Cefazolin Infusion in Patients Undergoing Major Surgery,"Abstract The administration of an antibiotic preoperatively is an important intervention that helps to reduce the risk of post-operative health-care associated infections (HCAI). These include urinary tract, surgical site and blood stream infection. Based on the current Surgical Infection Prevention Project, (SCIP) recommendations, the choice of the antibiotic is based on the nature and site of the surgery and the presence of a β-lactam allergy (Table 1).

Currently, the antibiotic treatment for preventing surgical infections is administered as a single bolus an hour before surgery, and every four hours after the initial dose. This presents a concentration profile that has a high concentration after the bolus, but decays as the kidneys remove the antibiotics. In this present study, investigators would like to compare this traditional method of delivery to a constant infusion model that would sustain a constant level of antibiotics that is defined by the difference between the rate of infusion and rate of clearance.","The current incidence of post-operative surgical infections varies between 6% for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery to greater than 30% in high-risk surgery. 1 The administration of an antibiotic preoperatively is an important intervention that helps to reduce the risk of post-operative health-care associated infections (HCAI). These include urinary tract, surgical site and blood stream infection. Based on the current Surgical Infection Prevention Project, (SCIP) recommendations, the choice of the antibiotic is based on the nature and site of the surgery and the presence of a β-lactam allergy (Table 2). The antibiotic of choice for perioperative prophylaxis remains first and second generation cephalosporin. These drugs have a broad range of antimicrobial activity against common skin pathogens and have an excellent safety profile.

Based on current recommendations, the cephalosporin is administered 1 hour prior to incision.1 Timing is critical, as both early and late administration of the antibiotic is associated with an increase risk of HCAI. Additional doses of the cephalosporin are administered at pre-set intervals based on the duration of the surgery in an attempt to maintain antibiotic concentrations at a desired level.

Antibiotics can be classified into two broad classes, based on their bacterial killing characteristics. Antibiotics with concentration-dependent killing characteristics require a high ratio between the peak concentration and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen, during the dosing interval. Therefore large infrequent doses of these antibiotics will result in optimal antibacterial activity.

In contrast β-lactam antibiotics, like cephalosporins, demonstrate time-dependent pharmacokinetics. This means that effective microbiological activity only occurs if the unbound (or free) plasma concentration of the drug is above the MIC for a specified time period. In infection models, bacteriostatic and bacteriocidical activity occurs when antibiotic concentrations are maintained above the MIC for 35-40% and 60-70% of the dosing interval respectively. However, in surgical prophylaxis, it is preferred that antibiotic concentrations are maintained above the MIC of the likely pathogen/s for the entire duration of the procedure. Therefore more frequent dosing or use of extended or continuous infusion of these drugs will better maintain the pharmacokinetic goals. Recent studies have shown that plasma levels of β-lactam antibiotics fall below the MIC 1-2 hours after the initial bolus dose in both normal and obese patients.2, 3 Even with appropriate re-dosing of the β-lactam antibiotic, there are times when the plasma concentration of the drug is below the MIC. The combination of sub-MIC plasma drug level and high bacteremic load can potentially increase the risk of developing a post-operative HCAI. It follows that to effectively prevent microbiological activity in the perioperative period the β-lactam antibiotic must remain above the MIC during the entire operative period. This is of particular importance in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery where the risk of perioperative surgical site infection (including superficial, deep and organ specific infection) is 13.1%. The aim of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of bolus and continuous cefazolin infusion during major abdominal surgery.

Hypothesis to be Tested Hypothesis A continuous infusion of cefazolin maintains the unbound plasma concentration above Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for the duration of the operative procedure better than the traditional bolus administration at every four hours.

Washington University School of Medicine,OTHER,NCT01146379,Does More Practice Improve Arm Movement After Stroke?,Dose Response of Movement Practice During Stroke Rehabilitation,Arm weakness happens a lot after a stroke. People often get physical or occupational therapy after their stroke to learn how to use their arm again. This study will help figure out how much therapy should be given to restore as much arm function as possible.,"Dose has emerged as a key factor promoting functional recovery after stroke. Currently, a lack of data on the dose-response relationship impedes progress in the field of stroke rehabilitation. The goal of the proposed project is to define the range of doses of movement practice that produce the greatest improvements in outcomes in people with chronic stroke. Borrowing from animal models of stroke, dose in humans can be quantified by the number of repetitions of task-specific practice.

Our central hypothesis is that there exists a range of doses for people with stroke, below which, there is minimal benefit, and above which, further practice does not result in further benefit. The range of beneficial doses is likely to vary based on the severity of motor deficits and the presence of non-motor deficits in other domains. Using a randomized, parallel dose-response design, we will evaluate the benefits of four different doses of task-specific upper extremity training with matched schedules of 1 hr sessions, 4 sessions/wk for 8 wks, in 100 people with chronic stroke. Total repetition doses to be evaluated (3200, 6400, 9600, \& individualized-maximum) are based on our preliminary data. The individualized-maximum group may extend their sessions beyond 8 wks until meeting defined stop criteria.

Our primary aim will test whether larger total doses result in better outcomes than smaller total doses. Benefits of the four doses will be evaluated at the impairment, activity, and participation levels, since understanding the dose-response relationship at all levels of measurement is critical for advancing rehabilitation research. We hypothesize that improvements will be greatest in the 9600 and individualized-maximum, followed by the 6400, and then the 3200 repetition dose groups. Our secondary aim is to characterize the dose-response relationship of upper extremity task-specific practice. With data from multiple assessment points, individual curve modeling will be used to estimate dose ranges, below which, there is minimal benefit, and above which, further practice does not result in further benefit. Furthermore, we will determine how various factors modify the dose estimates. We hypothesize that the severity of motor deficits will be the primary modifier of the dose-response relationship, with larger doses needed for those with more mild motor deficits. We further expect that needed doses will be larger for those with depression and hemispatial neglect.

Our team is well-positioned to investigate the critical issue of dose because of our expertise in stroke rehabilitation research and measurement, our understanding of the challenges of clinical practice and clinical research, and our ready access to this patient population. Expected outcomes from this project are empirically-driven estimates indicating the amount of movement practice required to drive maximal improvements and how these estimates can be individually modified for people undergoing stroke rehabilitation. Our estimates will immediately impact rehabilitation research and clinical practice. The importance of this project transcends stroke rehabilitation; our primary results will be of high value to many other rehabilitation populations also impeded by the lack of knowledge regarding dose-response relationships.","Inclusion Criteria:

Nij Smellinghe Hosptial,OTHER,NCT06438484,The Challenges of Evidence-based Prehabilitation in a Real-life Context for Patients Preparing for Colorectal Surgery,The Challenges of Evidence-based Prehabilitation in a Real-life Context for Patients Preparing for Colorectal Surgery - a Cohort Study and Multiple Case Analysis,"Background: Multimodal prehabilitation programs are effective in reducing complications after colorectal surgery in patients with high risk of postoperative complications due to low aerobic capacity and/or malnutrition. However, high implementation fidelity is needed to achieve these effects in real-life practice. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the implementation fidelity of an evidence-based prehabilitation program in the real-life context of a regional hospital.

Methods: In this observational cohort study with multiple case analysis, we enrolled all patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer from January 2023 to June 2023, in one Dutch peripheral hospital. Patients meeting criteria for low aerobic capacity or malnutrition were advised to participate in a personalized prehabilitation program. Implementation fidelity was investigated on four domains; 1) coverage (participation rate), 2) duration (number of days following the prehabilitation program), 3) content (delivery of prescribed intervention modalities), and 4) frequency (attendance of sessions and compliance with prescribed parameters). An aggregated percentage of content and frequency was calculated to determine overall adherence. The intended outcomes were improvement in preoperative aerobic capacity and malnutrition, and improved postoperative recovery (i.e., reducing complications, length of stay, and time to functional recovery).","Study design and patients This observational cohort study was conducted from January 2023 to June 2023 with case analysis on the high-risk patients following the prehabilitation program in Nij Smellinghe (NS). The study was approved by the Local Ethic Committee of NS. The first author was a physiotherapist, who acted as an embedded scientist in the colorectal pathway25. For the period of this study, only one physiotherapist and dietitian performed the prehabilitation program to prevent provider-dependent bias. All patients, both high-risk and low-risk, of 18 years or older scheduled for elective colorectal surgery in NS were asked for their informed consent to be included in the cohort. No exclusion criteria were applied. The STrengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline for reporting observational studies was followed26.

Study setting NS is a regional hospital with 339 beds in The Netherlands, where annually 150 patients undergo colorectal surgery27. NS is an innovative hospital in the field of perioperative care and the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol has been implemented into usual care since 201828. In January 2023, following new scientific insights, an evidence-based multimodal prehabilitation program was implemented in the colorectal pathway. This pathway included assessment of patients on their risk of postoperative complications and offering a multimodal prehabilitation program for high-risk patients.

Preoperative risk assessment When patients were indicated for colorectal surgery, a physiotherapist and dietitian conducted risk assessment for postoperative complications. Patients meeting criteria for low aerobic capacity and/or high risk of malnutrition were advised to participate in a personalized prehabilitation program2,29.

The physiotherapist assessed aerobic capacity. Aerobic capacity was measured by the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) or modified steep ramp test (SRT), following the protocol of previous research on preoperative risk assessment2,15,30. Patients with a low aerobic capacity, indicated by a work at peak exercise achieved at the modified SRT ≤1.5W/kg or an oxygen uptake at the VAT ≤11mL/kg/min at the CPET, were indicated as high-risk patients.

The dietitian evaluated risk of malnutrition by using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment Short Form (PG-SGA SF). Based on the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, patients were diagnosed with malnutrition, thus indicating the nutrition-modality of prehabilitation31. According to the GLIM-criteria, malnutrition is defined as the presence of one phenotypic criterion (non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and one etiologic criterion (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden)32. Muscle mass and body composition was assessed with the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (Bodygram Plus, Akern, Italy).

Patients with high-risk profile: multimodal prehabilitation program High-risk patients followed an evidence-based multimodal prehabilitation program for five weeks, incorporating modalities tailored to address their impairments2,12,15. Patients performed physical exercise training and/or received dietary counseling for five weeks, provided by a trained physiotherapist and dietitian (both \>15 years experience). The physical exercise training consisted of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) three times a week and functional strengthening exercises. Patients visited the hospital two times a week and performed home exercise training five times a week on a stationary cycle ergometer (Corival Home+, Lode BV, Groningen, The Netherlands).

The dietary intervention consisted of optimization of energy and protein intake, optimization of timing of eating protein-rich products, and if necessary additional protein and vitamin supplements. Individual protein requirements were set at 1.5-1.9 g/kg fat free mass. Patients used the eiFIT-application or a food diary to track their protein intake33.

Treating patients with low hemoglobin levels, offering alcohol- and smoking cessation interventions, and giving psychological support were also elements of the prehabilitation program in NS. However, this is already part of usual care since implementation of the ERAS-protocol and therefore not specifically evaluated in this study. A detailed description of the complete pathway is provided in Appendix 1.

Statistical analysis All data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. For patient characteristics continuous data were tested for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test and QQ-plot. Median and interquartile range (IQR) or mean and standard deviation were reported accordingly. To report the fidelity of the prehabilitation program, absolute values and percentages were given. To prevent selection bias, NS reimbursed the expenses of prehabilitation for people who otherwise could not afford it, as insurance companies did not reimburse prehabilitation in The Netherlands during the study period. Data were analyzed using R Framework 4.2.2 for macOS (version 2022, Vienna)42.","Inclusion Criteria:

Our goal is to develop methods by which global health practitioners can exploit face-to-face social network interactions in order to maximize uptake of neonatal and infant health interventions. The villages will be randomly assigned to 16 cells of 11 villages each in a 2 x 8 factorial design of different targeting algorithms.","Honduras has one of the highest neonatal mortality rates in Latin America despite having made significant strides in reducing neonatal, infant, and child mortality in the last several decades. Although many neonatal and infant deaths can be prevented through provision of clinical care services, emerging evidence also suggests that a substantial reduction in neonatal and infant mortality can also be achieved with simple, low-cost interventions within family and community settings. This is particularly important in areas where functional community health facilities are not available. Family and community outreach programs can serve to educate families about beneficial home care practices.

In order to accelerate neonatal mortality reduction , there is an urgent need to develop innovative solutions that are not only effective, but also more easily implementable and more readily scalable. An important component of this challenge, which has hitherto not been effectively measured and understood with respect to neonatal mortality, is the ""embeddedness"" of individuals within social networks. Hence, through a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) in rural Honduras, we will deploy and assess social network targeting algorithms in order to maximize diffusion and adoption of the ""Changing behaviors to improve neonatal, child, and maternal health using communication and social networks at the community level intervention (CBNH)"". The CBNH intervention is a household-level intervention package that targets health behaviors surrounding neonatal and maternal health, and diarrhea and respiratory illness prevention and management implemented by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and their partners.

This RCT is aimed at discerning optimal methods for targeting delivery of the intervention to the population. Specifically we will (1) test what percentage of a community needs to be in a program to achieve social norms change around key neonatal care behaviors, and (2) test whether so-called nominated-friend-targeting, a method that targets individuals who are more highly connected in the network, is more effective than a control strategy. Our 2x8 factorial design will examine how large a subset of the population should be used as a ""seed"" group in order to maximize the chances of spread of the effect, and the efficiency with which such an intervention might be delivered in the future. To do this, we will assign each of the 176 study villages to either one of the two groups: 1)random assignment (active comparator), where ""seed"" individuals are chose at random or 2) friend-of-random assignment (experimental), where ""seed"" individuals are chosen on the basis of being named as a friend of a randomly selected individual. Each of the groups of villages will also be assigned to one of eight treatment percentages (0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% 50%, 75%, 100%), where each represents the percent of targeted households in that village to receive the CBNH health intervention.","Inclusion Criteria: People who live or work in target villages, ages 12 and up -

This RCT is aimed at discerning optimal methods for targeting delivery of the intervention to the population. Specifically we will (1) test what percentage of a community needs to be in a program to achieve social norms change around key neonatal care behaviors, and (2) test whether so-called nominated-friend-targeting, a method that targets individuals who are more highly connected in the network, is more effective than a control strategy. Our 2x8 factorial design will examine how large a subset of the population should be used as a ""seed"" group in order to maximize the chances of spread of the effect, and the efficiency with which such an intervention might be delivered in the future. To do this, we will assign each of the 176 study villages to either one of the two groups: 1)random assignment (active comparator), where ""seed"" individuals are chose at random or 2) friend-of-random assignment (experimental), where ""seed"" individuals are chosen on the basis of being named as a friend of a randomly selected individual. Each of the groups of villages will also be assigned to one of eight treatment percentages (0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% 50%, 75%, 100%), where each represents the percent of targeted households in that village to receive the CBNH health intervention. Inclusion Criteria: People who live or work in target villages, ages 12 and up - Exclusion Criteria: People who do not live or work in the sample villages, and those who are prisoners, mentally impaired, or under age 12 years. -"

GBR Academy,NETWORK,NCT04332679,Non-resorbable Membranes Versus Titanium Meshes and Resorbable Membranes,Guided Bone Regeneration With Non-resorbable Membranes Versus Titanium Meshes and Resorbable Membranes.,"The objective of this study is to compare two surgical techniques for the treatment of the mandibular bone atrophies: Dense PTFE titanium-reinforced membranes (Group A) versus Titanium mesh covered with cross-linked collagen membranes (Group B).

Therefore, the main purposes are to compare test and control regarding (i) the percentage of post-operative complications (ii) the three-dimensional bone gain (iii) histological, histomorphometrical and microCT outcomes (iv) perImplant bone loss and soft tissue parameters.","In the last 10 years, short- and long-term studies have demonstrated that GBR is a successful and reliable technique for vertical and horizontal ridge augmentation. GBR can be achieved with two different approaches: application of either a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) titanium-reinforced membrane (i.e., a non-resorbable membrane) or a collagen membrane (i.e., a resorbable membrane). To achieve vertical bone augmentation, a resorbable membrane must be supported by a space-making device, such as a titanium mesh (Ti mesh) or a titanium osteosynthesis plate.

However, the use of a barrier device is a technique-sensitive procedure that is not free of complications. The main cause of GBR failure is related to early or late exposure of a barrier device, leading to contamination and infection of the biomaterial, irreversibly compromising bone regeneration.

This study aims to evaluate complication rates and vertical bone gain (VBG) after GBR with dense PTFE titanium-reinforced membranes versus with titanium mesh covered with cross-linked collagen membranes.

The primary objective of the study is, therefore, the evaluation of the healing complications; in particular, the early or delayed exposure of medical devices used for bone regeneration, during the healing period. This exposure is, as reported in all clinical studies, the main cause of the failure of the surgery. A secondary objective, is the quantitative assessment of bone regeneration obtained by the 2 techniques. In particular, the evaluation of the reconstructed bone volume (RBV) with respect to the planned bone volume (PBV). Other targets include the qualitative evaluation of bone regeneration through histological and histomorphometric analysis of the bone biopsies obtained at the moment that the medical device is removed and finally the evaluation of the peri-implant bone resorption will be conducted over time. This study was designed as a pilot, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, comparative clinical trial. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Prot. CMF 01/2013; number 30/2013/O/Disp).

The study included 40 patients with partial edentulism, associated with alveolar atrophy in the posterior regions of the mandible, who were referred to the Unit of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Italy.

Patients were randomized into two study groups, depending on a previous computer-generated randomization sequence. Group A included 20 patients treated by means of a dense PTFE (d-PTFE) titanium-reinforced membrane, and Group B included 20 patients treated by means of a titanium mesh (Ti mesh) and cross-linked collagen membrane.

The study included 3 different treatment phases: the first phase (T0) involves bone regeneration with Dense PTFE titanium-reinforced membranes (Group A) or Titanium mesh covered with cross-linked collagen membranes (Group B) and simultaneous implants placement; the second one (T1), subsequently, after 6 months, this will forsee the removal of the regeneration devices; the third (T2), 3 months after the aforementioned, will forsee the final functional loading of the implants, with a consequent follow-up of the regenerated bone. All the materials and tools used in the study are CE certified and have already been used in the normal care path for patients who have undergone bone regeneration. Moreover, the control visits and the radiological investigations of the data were summarized in the case report form (CRF), and are those that characterize the normal care path of patients undergoing necessary bone regeneration for prosthetic implant rehabilitation when the bone quantity is insufficient.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of group B (Ti mesh) compared to technique A (d-PTFE membrane) in the incidence of complications. The Secondary objectives include: assessment of reconstructed bone volume (RBV) compared to planned bone volume (PBV), histological and histomorphometric analysis of bone quality obtained and periimplant bone resorption after 12 months of follow-up.

The sample size calculation showed that with a minimum of 17 patients per group (total of 34 patients), it will be possible to detect a 35% difference in complications and a difference of 1 mm in VBG between the two groups with a standard deviation a=1 and a significance level of a = 0.05 with a power of 80%. To protect from possible drop-outs, the sample size was increased by to 20 patients per group (total of 40 patients).

The results obtained in the two study groups (Groups A and B) were subjected to statistical description and analyses using specific tests to determine statistically significant differences between them. Both the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations were analyzed. The patient was regarded as the statistical unit of analysis for all analyses, except that of implant stability, which was carried out considering the implant as the statistical unit. Statistical differences in complication rates were investigated using Fisher's exact test. Differences in implant stability, peri-implant bone defects, and VBG at T0 and T1 were investigated using t-tests for unpaired data. Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. The statistician was blinded and external to working group.","Inclusion Criteria:

Assiut University,OTHER,NCT04838379,Ultrasound Guided Rectus Sheath Block and Transversus Abdominis Plane Block,Perioperative Analgesic Effect of Preemptive Ultrasound Guided Rectus Sheath Block and Transversus Abdominis Plane Block With Dexmedetomidine vs Dexamethasone for Laparoscopic Surgery in Paediatrics,The current study aimed to assess the efficacy of Dexmedetomidine (DEX) and Dexamethasone as an adjuvant to ultrasound guided TAP and RS block to prolongation of postoperative analgesia and better pain control in children undergoing laparoscopic surgeries,"Laparoscopic surgeries are one of the most frequently performed paediatric surgeries . Although minimally invasive, this technique is still associated with a significant amount of pain and anxiety in children . Indeed, children who are highly anxious prior to surgery tend to have more postoperative pain, delayed hospital discharge, and higher incidence of emergence delirium, sleep disturbances, and other mal-adaptive behaviour changes that can last up to a few weeks following surgery . To improve analgesia and decrease postoperative anxiety in children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies multimodal approach for pain control can be employed.

Over the past years, the concept of pain management has extended from simply decreasing pain intensity to optimizing patient's condition. The goal is to decrease pain scores, stress response that should be avoided in patients, particularly cardiac patients, together with a decrease in analgesics-related adverse effects like nausea, vomiting, retention of urine and over sedation. By achieving these goals, we can certainly facilitate patient recovery and minimize the hospital stay. Improved pain control can be achieved by a combination of different types of regional analgesia with systemic analgesics. The main contributor to pain post abdominal operations is the pain from abdominal wall incision .

Many procedures were followed to decrease this intense postoperative pain such as, epidural catheter analgesia, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, local wound infiltration, Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA), peripheral nerve blocks, in addition to systemic administration of Non-Steroidal Anti- Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids .

The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a regional anesthetic technique that provides analgesia to the parietal peritoneum as well as to the skin and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall (9-10). Despite a relatively low risk of complications and a high success rate using modern techniques, TAP block remains overwhelmingly underused. Although the technique is technically straightforward, it has not been adopted in clinical practice .

Moreover, The Rectus Sheath Block (RSB) is one of these regional techniques that are suitable for operations with a midline incision or laparoscopic surgery with the main incision at the umbilical port. A previous study showed the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided rectus sheath block for laparoscopic appendectomy compared to a control group injected with saline instead of a local anesthetic Generally, in laparoscopic surgeries, the sites of port incision are associated with considerable postoperative discomfort. Thus, we performed TAP and RS block to ameliorate postoperative pain and improve patient outcomes. In addition to the usefulness of traditional local anesthetics to provide analgesia during the course of the postoperative period is restricted by their short duration of action .

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) and Dexamethasone has been shown as a valuable additives to local anesthetics in neuraxial blocks and peripheral nerve blocks leading to prolongation of postoperative analgesia and better pain control .

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) α-2 adrenergic receptor consists of three α-2 isoreceptors (α-2a, α-2b and α-2c), which regulate the various pharmacodynamic effects of this drug . The α-2a receptor seems to promote sedation and anxiolysis in the locus coeruleus, as well as to generate bradycardia and peripheral vasodilation by stimulation of the cerebral vasomotor center. The α-2b receptor prevents tremor, generates analgesia in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord and determines peripheral vasoconstriction. The α-2c receptor modulates the mental state .

Dexamethasone, a high-potency, long-acting glucocorticoid, has been shown to prolong peripheral nerve blockade . Dexamethasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors and inhibits potassium conductance, which decreases nociceptive C-fiber activity . Dexamethasone may also extend the duration of analgesia via local vasoconstrictive and systemic anti-inflammatory effects .

Thus, we performed TAP and RS block to ameliorate postoperative pain and improve patient outcomes.

State University of New York at Buffalo,OTHER,NCT04709679,Laser Dosage in MicroPulse TransScleral CycloPhotocoagulation,Clinical Outcome of Varying Doses of Micropulse TransScleral CycloPhotocoagulation Laser in Patients With Glaucoma.,"This is a prospective study to evaluate the clinical outcome of varying doses of Micropulse TransScleral CycloPhotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) laser in patients with glaucoma. The study will assess documented complication rates, changes in visual acuity after the procedure, changes in intraocular pressures and medication drop usage, and need for subsequent treatments (including further laser or surgery).","Glaucoma is a condition where an increase in the accumulation of aqueous humor inside the anterior chamber of the eye results in raised intraocular pressure (IOP), visual field defects and cupping of optic disc. Typically, patients who have glaucoma are treated with topical medications or incisional surgery to lower the IOP. Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) is a non-incisional laser surgery used in the treatment of glaucoma. MP-TSCPC powered by the Cyclo G6 (Iridex Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA) causes mild thermal damage to the ciliary body (gland that produces aqueous fluid in the eye), which, in turn, causes a decrease in intraocular pressure. MP-TSCPC is a variation of a longstanding older treatment for glaucoma, traditional diode TSCPC, which caused a significant amount of tissue damage and therefore was reserved for the treatment of end stage glaucoma.

The micropulse laser application includes an on-off cycle. In an on cycle, the micropulse probe administers a short pulse of laser energy followed by an off cycle which is a rest period for the tissue to cool off before the next on-off cycle begins. This corresponds to 0.5 ms duration of ""on-time"" and 1.1 ms interval of ""off-time"" during the laser application. This on-off cycle allows for the laser to treat the affected area without evidence of tissue damage, as opposed to the traditional diode TSCPC. Because only 31.3% of the total laser energy is applied to the ciliary body, there is a less tissue damage, less post-operative inflammation, and decreased complication rates. Therefore, MP-TSCPC is currently being utilized for milder cases of glaucoma, and in patients with viable vision. The laser probe is usually applied perpendicular to the limbus in a continuous sweeping motion, for an average of 10 seconds of sweeping time per hemifield, referred to as ""dwell time"". Therefore, the three parameters that can be varied in the treatment with MP-TSCPC are total laser duration (seconds), laser power (mW) and dwell time (seconds/hemifield).

Most of the studies used a laser power of 2000 - 2500 mW. The laser duration also has varied between studies. A duration time of 50 to 180 sec per hemisphere was used in different studies. Most studies have utilized a dwell time of 10 seconds per hemifield, and one cited an application of a ""stop and go"" method, applying the laser in discrete spots at 10 seconds each.

In all of the prior studies, despite the variable applications of power, dwell time, and duration, there have been similar rates of complications such as vision loss, macular edema, and hypotony. Generally, the laser duration is tailor-made and is adjusted based on the iris color and severity of glaucoma. However, there is a gap in knowledge on systematic comparison of different doses of MP-TSCPC for a safe and effective treatment of glaucoma. This study will systematically evaluate the clinical outcome of glaucoma surgery based on a logical variation of MP-TSCPC laser dosing parameters.","Inclusion Criteria:

University of British Columbia,OTHER,NCT04400279,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Exercise Study,COvid-19 Pandemic and Exercise (COPE) Trial: A Randomized Study Examining Physical Activities and Wellbeing in Individuals Mandated to Stay at Home,The COPE Trial is a randomized controlled trial that will provide currently isolated yet generally physically healthy 18-64 year old adults who are pre-retirement with the opportunity to receive a free 3-month subscription to either a yoga or moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise app or be randomized to a waitlist control group. Study outcomes include measures of psychological wellbeing and physical health.,"Global stay-at-home mandates implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are having substantial negative effects on mental health. Developing approaches to maintain the mental health of all individuals during this unprecedented time of physical distancing is of paramount importance. In the proposed low cost randomized controlled trial (RCT), the investigators seek to answer whether the use of a mobile app that provides a variety of physical activities appropriate for home workouts \[i.e., high intensity interval training (HIIT), yoga\] can improve wellbeing and health in adults mandated to stay at home. Should the results of this trial support the efficacy of the intervention (via app delivery), this has the potential to be implemented and delivered rapidly and at scale.

Engaging in regular physical activity confers reduced risk for mental disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety) in clinical and non-clinical populations. The investigators' recent evidence also suggests that becoming physically active reduces depressive symptoms, as well as negative affect and rumination on a daily basis, while improving daily positive affect and a sense of control in highly stressed adults. With fitness centres currently closed by mandate, becoming physically active during the COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be a challenge for individuals who are typically inactive, those mandated to stay-at-home, or those who do not have opportunities to access outdoor spaces that provide the recommended two meters of distance between people. Thus, the investigators seek to support those living under stay-at-home mandates with access to mobile apps that provide opportunities to be physically active in the home environment.

The study will focus on physical activities requiring little physical space or equipment that are easily completed at home. The study includes yoga, a movement-based activity that promotes relaxation and mindfulness and only requires space for the full length and width of one's body, and a mat as equipment. Yoga has been shown to be effective in improving physical function and quality of life in RCTs. The study also includes whole body weight (WBW)-based HIIT, which also only requires a mat, making it an excellent home-based form of aerobic exercise. HIIT is characterized as bouts of high-intensity exercise combined with periods of recovery or lower intensity activity. Its physical and psychological benefits compared to continuous moderate intensity training are often evidenced to be equal or significantly stronger.

Aims. The primary outcome will be a measure of depressive symptomology. It is hypothesized that those who actively use the yoga and/or WBW-HIIT mobile apps will improve in their depressive symptomatology compared to the waitlist control group over the course of the 6-week RCT. The study will also include measures of, as secondary outcomes, psychological distress, quality of life, and self-reported physical health, and expect decreases in distress and increases in the remaining outcomes. The researchers will also investigate whether effects are stronger in those (a) who currently live alone vs. live with others, or (b) with poorer levels of psychological health pre-randomization.","Inclusion Criteria:

Er:YAG ablative fractional laser (AFL) treatment removes the stratum corneum to increase MAL uptake and may improve efficacy. However, no studies have directly compared the efficacy of Er:YAG AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT in treating nodular BCC in Asians.","Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer in the Caucasian population, with an incidence rising worldwide. there is an increasing trend in the incidence rates of BCC in asian and greater percentage of pigmented BCCs is found to be the most characteristic clinical feature of BCC in Asian compared to BCC in Caucasians. Topical photodynamic therapy with methyl-aminolaevulinate (MAL-PDT) has been introduced as an alternatively attractive procedure for BCC. PDT facilitates the light activation of a photosensitizer in the presence of oxygen. The oxygen generates reactive oxygen species leading to selective and highly localized destruction of abnormal cells. MAL is an efficient photosensitizer as a result of improved lesion penetration attributed to enhanced lipophilicity, decreased charge and also has a greater specificity for neoplastic cells, compared with 5-aminolevulinic acid. Because histologic features of nBCC include down-growth of epithelial buds into the dermis, palisading basal cell and separation of epidermis from the underlying dermis, it is generally treated twice within an interval of 1 week.But, MAL-PDT shows the lower efficacy for the treatment of pigmented BCC because melanin disturbs the absorption of the MAL. Also, a significantly higher proportions of BCC in the Asian population were pigmented BCC compared with pigmented BCC of Caucasian. Consequently, additional techniques are needed to enhance the penetration and accumulation of MAL in order to improve PDT efficacy and decrease treatment duration in darker-skinned patients.

Er:YAG ablative fractional laser therapy (AFL) can ablate the epidermis and dermis without significant thermal injury. This approach creates microscopic ablation zones (MAZ) in laser-applied portion of the skin. The tissue with MAZ is surrounded by thin layers of coagulated tissue. Since the Er:YAG AFL resurfaces 5-20% of the skin at one time and does not injure the entire thickness of the epidermis, healing times are minimized. Recent studies have demonstrated that Er:YAG AFL facilitates delivery and uptake of topical MAL deep into the skin, enhancing porphyrin synthesis and photodynamic activation. We have compared the efficacy, recurrence rate, cosmetic outcomes and safety of Er:YAG AFL-PDT with standard MAL-PDT in the treatment of nBCC among Korean populations.","Inclusion Criteria:

University of Copenhagen,OTHER,NCT03210779,Effect of Probiotics on Oral Wound Healing - Pilot Study,Effect of Probiotic Tablets and Topical Probiotic Oil (Lactobacillus. Reuteri) on Oral Wound Healing (Pilot Study),This research will study the healing of standardized wounds created in the oral mucosa of volunteer participants during daily intake of tablets and topical application of oil containing the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri. Our null hypothesis is that the consumption and topical application of probiotic supplements containing L. reuteri does not improve clinical healing of oral wounds in healthy participants when compared to controls.,"Intervention: after informed consent and baseline collection of clinical data (age,sex), the participants will be randomly assigned to one of the order of the treatments. As a run-in period, they will be given a supply of probiotic or placebo tablets enough for seven days. The participants are instructed to take two tablets daily (one in the morning and one in the evening, days 0-7) and are asked to refrain from any other foods or supplements containing probiotics. On day eight, the participant will attend to the clinics and a punch biopsy will be performed. Depending on the allocation group, probiotic or placebo oil will be supplied. The participant will be instructed to apply the oil locally on the wound with a plastic microbrush for 9 days every evening, and strongly reinforced to continue with the assigned tablets twice daily. The participant will attend the clinics on days two, five and eight post-wounding for follow-up photographies of wound healing. The first intervention period terminates with a wash-out period of four weeks, and then the second run-in an intervention period start following the same procedures.

The probiotic tablets and the probiotic oil (at the recommended dose) contain 2x10\^8 CFU of Lactobacillus reuteri. Both the placebo tablets and oil are identical in size and composition but without the addition of the probiotic strains. The tablets and oil are packed in identical pots/bottles with color coding. The code will be kept from the investigators until the analysis are finished. Both the tablets and oil are provided by BIOGAIA AB.

Clinical procedures and sampling

All clinical procedures and sample collections will be conducted by a qualified and authorized dentist from the Institute of Odontology, Section for Cariology, Endodontics, Pediatric Dentistry and Clinical Genetics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. Collected samples (saliva, wound exudate and bacterial smear) will be stored in a freezer at -80 °C until all samples from all patients are gathered -for a maximum of six months. Running of all collected samples at the same time allows laboratory analyses to be carried out efficiently and avoids errors.

Punch biopsy: on day eight, a standardized circular wound of 3.5 mm diameter and approximately 1.5 mm deep will be created in the mucosa of the hard palate with aid of a biopsy punch. The biopsy is performed under aseptic conditions and local anesthesia using lidocaine 2% combined with epinephrine for local hemostasis. A scalpel is used to remove the surface epithelium and underlying superficial connective tissue, which will be discarded according to biosafety regulations from the Institute of Dentistry, University of Copenhagen. After wounding, the wound site will be photographed (blind-coded) with an intraoral camera, placing a standard-sized 6 mm diameter template around the wound as reference. The participant will attend to the dental clinics on days two, five and eight post-wounding to have a photograph of the wound taken by Ph.D student Gina Castiblanco. The wound-size on photographs will be measured by two raters and will be expressed as the ratio of the wound surface area relative to the standard label size with aid of software (Canvas 7, ACD Systems of America). The endpoint will be the percentage of initial wound size, measured at days two, five and eight post-wounding.

Saliva sampling: six samples of unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) fro m each subject will be collected (one at baseline, one right after the run-in period and one at the end of the intervention period). For USW collection, the participant will be sitting in a comfortable position with the head slightly bent. The participant is asked to keep the eyes open and make as few moves as possible, including swallowing. Then, he/she is asked to rinse the mouth in water and spit it out again. Thereafter, he/she is instructed to let saliva flow out of the mouth down a designated plastic cup for ten minutes. Aliquots of saliva (1.5 ml) will immediately be placed on ice and stored in a freezer at -80 °C until further analysis.

Collection of wound exudate: eight samples of wound exudate will be collected in total. The wound site will be dried with cotton pellets and periopaper strips (ProFlow, Amityville, NY, USA) will be gently pressed on the wound for 20 s. In case of blood contamination, the strip is discharged and the sampling is repeated after five min. The volume of exudate is recorded using a Peritron 8000 (Proflow) and expressed in µL. One strip holds approximately 0.1-0.4 µL of exudate. The strips are then transferred to plastic tubes and stored at -80 until further analysis.

Bacterial smear collection: four bacterial smears will be sampled. A sterile swab will be passed through the wound site, placed in a plastic tube and stored freezed at -80 °C until further analysis. The smears will be subjected to conventional microbial cultivation to detects the presence/absence and counts of bacterial species commonly associated with delayed wound healing (β-hemolytic streptococci and S. aureus).

Perception of pain and discomfort: a one-page logbook will be handed to the participants at the beginning of each run-in period so they can register the intake of tablets and their own perception of pain and discomfort according to a VAS-scale. The participant is also encouraged to register factors that could possibly influence the outcome (physical activity and number of alcoholic drinks). The participant will be asked to bring the filled logbook in the end of the intervention period.

Perceived stress and general health: in the end of the intervention period, the participant will be asked to fill the validated General Heath Questionnaire GHQ-12 (10) and the validated Perceived Stress Scale (11). These factors (self-perception of stress and general health) are known to be possible cofounders of wound healing outcomes.

Compliance: at the beginning of each intervention period, the participants will be provided with tablets enough for 16 days and oil for topical use enough for nine days application. Compliance will be checked through the participant´s completion of a logbook in which the daily intake of tablets and oil application is registered. For the last appointment, the participants will be asked to bring the remaining tablets and oil for counting/estimating.

Data analysis: all data will be processed with the open source statistics software ""R"" and controlled for normal distribution. Multivariate and univariate analysis of variance (MANOVAs and ANOVAs) will be used to assess within-subject change over time. A p-value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The obtained results will be published in an internationally recognized journal. If the results cannot be published in a journal, they will be available at the website of the University of the Odontology Institute. We make emphasis in that positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published.

Data management: all collected data will be treated in compliance with the Act on Processing of Personal Data and ""The Health Law"". At inclusion the participants will be assigned a unique number and a separate protocol without personal identification number. This study will not be reported to ""Datatilsynet"" as it is a private scientific health project","Inclusion Criteria:

A secondary aim is the identification of good and poor outcome predictors after revisional strategies for intractable or chronic marginal ulcer.","The epidemic of overweight and obesity in the United States of America along with its comorbidities continues to expand. Bariatric surgery has demonstrated to be the most effective and sustained method to control severe obesity and its comorbidities. For instance, type 2 diabetes mellitus was completely resolved in 76.8%, systemic arterial hypertension was resolved in 61.7%, dyslipidemia improved in 70% and obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome was resolved in 85.7%. Furthermore, bariatric surgery significantly increases life expectancy (89%) and decreases overall mortality (30-40%), particularly deaths from diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Lastly, preliminary evidence about downstream savings associated with bariatric surgery offset the initial costs in 2 to 4 years.

Since 1998, there has been a substantially progressive increase in bariatric surgery. In 2005, the ASMBS reported that 81% of bariatric procedures were approached laparoscopically and in 2007, 205,000 people had bariatric surgery in the United States from which approximately 80% of these were Gastric Bypass. Moreover, there is a mismatch between eligibility and receipt of bariatric surgery with just less than 1% of the eligible population being treated for morbid obesity through bariatric surgery. Along with the increasing number of elective primary weight loss procedures, up to 20% of post RYGB patients cannot sustain their weight loss beyond 2 to 3 years after the primary bariatric procedure. Thus, revisional surgery for poor weight loss and re-operations for technical or mechanical complications will rise in a parallel manner.

A common late complication after gastric bypass surgery is marginal ulceration, an ulcer at the margins of the gastrojejunostomy on the jejunal side. Its incidence after RYGB ranges from as low as 0.6 to as high as 16%. After 1,040 laparoscopic RYGB surgeries, the incidence rate, in our hands, is 1.4% and mainly related to NSAID´s use. In observational cohort studies, the presence of specific technical factors - staple-line dehiscence or gastro-gastric fistula, enlarged pouch, foreign material and local ischemia - and environmental factors - tobacco, NSAID´s, alcohol consumption, and H pylori infection among others - have been associated with marginal ulceration however the exact etiopathogenesis has not been completely elucidated.

Similar to peptic ulcer disease (PUD), most marginal ulcers respond to medical therapy, specifically sucralfate and acid-lowering medication. In contrast, when perforation, obstruction, penetration, bleeding and/or intractability presents, complex or complicated ulcer disease, warrants surgical intervention.

The intestinal mucosa is not typically exposed to gastric acid, which is neutralized by the alkaline biliopancreatic secretions. The jejunal mucosa has no natural barriers; when exposed to gastric acid, it ulcerates easily. Capella \& Capella demonstrated that transecting the gastric segments significantly reduce staple-line dehiscence; this is the so-called divided gastric bypass. In the retrospective analysis of their consecutive series, the incidence for gastro-gastric fistula (GGF) formation after undivided gastric bypass (GBP) was 23%, after a partially divided GBP was 19%, after a completely divided GBP was 2% and after complete transection with interposition of the jejunal limb was 0% (p \<0.001). MacLean et al confirmed that divided primary gastric bypass decreases GGF formation (29% vs. 3%). Also, patients who developed marginal ulcers had a lower pH as well as a greater time with a pH less than 2 correlating 100% with the presence of GGF; closure of the GGF increased the pH in the pouch with subsequent healing of the marginal ulcer.

An unusually large gastric pouch (such as horizontal pouches, retained fundus, long lesser curvature based pouches or enlarged after initially being sized adequately) contain more acid-producing parietal cells. Increased acid production in the pouch carries the risk of developing marginal ulcers. Acid secretion in the small pouch after RYGB is virtually absent. Smith et al measured basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion from the pouch were significantly lower compared to age and sex-matched controls. Likewise, MacLean et al reported a significantly lower pH \& greater time with pH \<2 in the gastric pouches of marginal ulcers and/or GGF patients after RYGB compared to non-complicated RYGB controls. Thus, creating a esophagojejunostomy would solve the gastric acid factor for developing marginal ulcers however the high incidence of anastomotic failure and unknown weight loss results are prohibitive for this approach. Sapala et al created a micro-pouch or cardiojejunostomy to decrease at maximum the parietal cell mass with a low incidence of marginal ulcers (0.01% at 1 years of follow-up) as well as to limit the pouch dilation. By Histopathology with a semi-quantitative approach, Gustavsson et al reported less acid-producing parietal cells within smaller pouches. With his next study (n=12), Gustavsson et al, demonstrated a significantly higher time exposure to a pH\<4 in patients with marginal ulcer after RYGB (4x3cm pouch) compared to controls (p\< 0.01). Furthermore, after downsizing the pouch, repeated pH-metry showed the % of time with pH \<4 declined from 100% prior to 6% after revisionary surgery.

The anastomotic techniques influence the incidence of marginal ulcers. Capella \& Capella reported a consecutive series with significant decrement from 5.1% to 1.5% (p\< 0.001) after switching from a stapled to a hand-sewn anastomosis. Likewise, after changing from an inner layer of absorbable suture and an outer layer of nonabsorbable material to a double-layer of absorbable suture the incidence rate improved from 1.6% to 0%. Dr Schauer´s group confirmed a significant improvement in the incidence rate of MU from a 2.6% with the use of nonabsorbable suture for the outer layer to 1.3% after the change to absorbable suture for both layers (p \< 0.001).

Local ischemia, in the immediate postoperative period, is probably secondary to technical reasons. Fundamental aspects for decreasing tension and local ischemia at the gastrojejunostomy are dissection of the tissues around the pouch without devascularizing the lesser curvature and complete mobilization of a well-perfused Roux limb.

In epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies, NSAID´s have been identified as one of the three major risk factors for PUD. Wilson et al found NSAID´s consumption to significantly increase the risk for marginal ulcer following RYGB (adjusted OR 11.5, 95%CI 4.8-28).

In epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies, Tobacco is another major risk factor for PUD. Smoking carries an overall relative risk of 2.2 (95%CI, 2.0-2.3).

Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection carries an overall relative risk of 3.3 (95%CI, 2.6-4.4) for developing PUD. A synergistic relationship exists between H pylori infection and NSAID´s consumption for developing PUD with an overall risk of 3.5 (95%CI, 1.26-9.96) compared to either H pylori or NSAID´s negative individuals. In Papasavas et al study, preoperative H. pylori testing with prophylactic eradication did not decrease the incidence of MU or erosive pouch gastritis.

The pathophysiological mechanisms of damage to the gastric mucosa of ethanol and alcoholic beverages are poorly understood. There are no studies available about the effect of alcohol on marginal ulcer development after RYGB.

Cocaine use is responsible for approximately 143,000 Emergency Department visits annually; 19% of American, between 18 to 25 years old, have used cocaine: more than 1% of the Americans use cocaine at least once a week; and approximately 50% of all drug-related deaths were secondary to Cocaine. The temporal association between smoking cocaine (crack) and GI tract manifestations include ulceration, perforation, visceral infarction, and retroperitoneal fibrosis.

Re-operative strategies for addressing chronic marginal ulcers after gastric bypass have been scarcely described and mostly are reports of a case or small series of cases. The revisional strategies described are I) ulcer excision with revision of the gastrojejunostomy and gastric transection if needed, II) ulcer excision with pouch downsizing and redo of gastrojejunostomy, III) ulcer excision with resection of the ischemic Roux limb segment, and IV) ulcer excision and reversal. The possible adjuvant procedures includes I) proximal remnant gastrectomy (partial gastrectomy), and II) vagotomy.

In summary, there is scant information about late complications after gastric bypass especially after the widespread adoption of the laparoscopic approach and the modern anatomical construct of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery.","Inclusion Criteria:

A secondary aim is the identification of good and poor outcome predictors after revisional strategies for intractable or chronic marginal ulcer. The epidemic of overweight and obesity in the United States of America along with its comorbidities continues to expand. Bariatric surgery has demonstrated to be the most effective and sustained method to control severe obesity and its comorbidities. For instance, type 2 diabetes mellitus was completely resolved in 76.8%, systemic arterial hypertension was resolved in 61.7%, dyslipidemia improved in 70% and obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome was resolved in 85.7%. Furthermore, bariatric surgery significantly increases life expectancy (89%) and decreases overall mortality (30-40%), particularly deaths from diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

One type of this disease is nonsegmental vitiligo (NSV). Until now, there is no satisfactory treatment for vitiligo. Vitiligo therapies are medical therapy include topical and systemic therapy, phototherapy as well as surgery. Surgical treatment is indicated in stable vitiligo, which is not responding to medical treatment. This procedure consists of tissue grafting and cellular transplantation. Mini punch graft (MPG) is the most frequently performed tissue transplantation technique, while cellular transplantation from autologous noncultured extracted hair follicle outer root sheath cell suspension (NCEHFORSCS) containing melanocyte stem cells, is currently a promising option.","Current NSV treatments can be considered suboptimal and leading to decreased patient's quality of life due to the emotional burden of therapy dissatisfaction. When a stable NSV is not responding to medical therapy, surgery may be a useful treatment approach.

MPG as the most frequently performed tissue transplantation technique transferred the epidermal melanocyte to vitiligo lesion, while NCEHFORSCS provides melanocytes with better properties and contains melanocyte stem cells. The advantages of melanocytes from ORS compared to epidermal are the follicular melanocyte:keratinocyte ratio consists of one melanocyte for every five keratinocytes or 1:5 in the hair bulb, melanocytes are more dendritic, have larger melanosomes, and have the potential to produce more melanin pigment.

Priscilla McAuliffe,OTHER,NCT02206984,Endocrine Response in Women With Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer,A Trial of Endocrine Response in Women With Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer,"RATIONALE: Currently, adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a ""one-size-fits- all"" approach, with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, and most postmenopausal receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype.

PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.

Primary Objective:

To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).","OBJECTIVES

Primary

To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).

Secondary

* To evaluate ER protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate PR protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate ER-related and ILC-specific candidate gene mRNA expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in an effort to identify biomarkers of endocrine response and putative drivers of endocrine resistance in ILC.
* To evaluate associations between changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with ER and PR protein expression, or ER and candidate gene mRNA expression at baseline and post-treatment.

Exploratory

* To evaluate DNA methylation in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate associations between germline and somatic DNA sequence variants with changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate the activity of signaling pathways in ILC tissues by immunohistochemical or other protein analyses, such as histone modifications, at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer, that is hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm) radiographically or clinically, clinical stages I-III. Invasive lobular histology will be diagnosed at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation. Subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment.
* Prior to initiation of study agents, study participants will be highly encouraged to undergo a baseline research core biopsy of their breast tumor. If this is not possible or the patient refuses, the pre-treatment tumor sample must be obtained from their archival diagnostic core biopsy. If definitive surgery is not performed at day 21-27 after study treatment, a second post-treatment research core biopsy will need to be obtained from their breast tumor. For patients undergoing surgery, the second biopsy will be removed from the breast tumor tissue excised during their operation. Note: In the event that the baseline breast tumor biopsy performed for research purposes does not yield adequate tumor tissue for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, tissue will be requested from the patient's archival clinical diagnostic core biopsy if it is available.The patient will still remain on study and complete protocol therapy as planned in this unlikely event.
* Hormone receptor (HR) status of the invasive component must be documented before trial enrollment. The tumor must be HR-positive. HR will be considered positive if staining is 1% or greater for ER and/or PR. This will be determined at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation and enrollment onto the trial. Subsequently, HR status will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to enrolling the patient. HER2 status will be determined locally only, based upon current ASCO/CAP guidelines.
* Patients must be female.
* Participants must be fully postmenopausal.
* ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.
* Adequate organ and marrow function as defined by a history and physical exam that rules out comorbidities that would be exclusions to participation in the study (see exclusion criteria) and clinical laboratory parameters as deemed clinically appropriate by the treating physician.
* Prior use of hormone contraceptives and replacement therapy is allowed (e.g., estrogen and/or progestin), but must have been discontinued at least 30 days prior to the study enrollment. Vaginal preparations (e.g., Vagifem® or Estring®)
* Participant must be aware of the nature of her malignancy, understand the study requirements and risks and be able and willing to sign a written informed consent document.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Prior or concurrent use of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or novel therapy to treat the current breast cancer, including any history of prior irradiation to the ipsilateral breast.

Balikesir University,OTHER,NCT05676879,Ice Massage Applied to SP6 Point at Labor,"The Effect of Ice Massage Applied to SP6 Point on Labor Pain, Labor Comfort, Labor Duration, and Anxiety","Purpose: In the study , it was aimed to determine the effect of ice massage applied to SP6 point during labor on labor pain, labor comfort, labor duration, and anxiety.

Design: A single blind, randomized controlled experimental trial Setting and Participants: 100 primiparas, 50 in the intervention group and 50 in the control group, with 4-5 cm cervical dilatations were included in the study. Ice massage was applied to the SP6 point of the pregnant women in the intervention group at 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm, and 8-9 cm dilatations during three contractions.

Measurement Tools: The Pregnant Information Form, VAS, the Partograph Form, Childbirth Comfort Questionnaire (CCQ), and the State Anxiety Scale were used to collect data.","The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial in the Delivery Room of Ataturk City Hospital located in Balikesir province of Turkey between December 2021 and July 2022.

Participants The study sample size was calculated by using G\*Power 3 power calculations based on previous studies in which ice massage was applied to acupressure points during labor. Impact estimation was obtained from the findings of the study conducted by Hajiamini et al., who reported pain severity as 5.90 ± 1.84 in the ice massage group and 7.10 ± 1.64 in the control group 30 minutes after the ice massage application. In the present study, it was aimed to determine a similar difference. The sample size for each group was determined to be at least 47 individuals. Accordingly, 50 primiparas were assigned to the intervention group and the control group each. The power analysis performed showed that the sample size of the study had a power as α = 0.05, Power = 0.91, df = 98. The decrease observed in labor pain at 4-5 cm cervical dilatation compared to the control group had an impact size of 0.61.

The inclusion criteria for the primiparas were having a single healthy fetus, having a gestational age between 38 and 40 weeks, expecting vaginal delivery, having fetal cephalic presentation, having no chronic diseases, not having a high-risk pregnancy, being in stage 1 of childbirth, and having a 4-5 cm cervical dilatation. Pregnant women who were multiparous, had multiple pregnancies, had high-risk pregnancy, had delivery with complications, and came to the clinic after 4-5 cm dilatation were excluded from the study.

Single blind block randomization for pregnant women who met the inclusion criteria was achieved by using Sequence Generator method located under the subheading of Numbers at random.org website. In the program, two columns were created according to the sample size. The pregnant women were randomly assigned to Column 1 or Column 2 according to their registration number. The assignment of the columns to either the intervention group or the control group was done through a draw. Ice massage was applied to SP6 points of the pregnant women in the intervention group, while the pregnant women in the control group was provided with standard midwifery care.

Data collection The Pregnant Information Form (PIF), Visual Analog Scale (VAS-1), and Childbirth Comfort Questionnaire (CCQ) were administered to the pregnant women who were at stage 1 of delivery and 4-5 cm cervical dilatation. Each group was provided with standard midwifery care, and intervention was made to the women in the intervention group at 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm, and 8-9 cm cervical dilatation during three contractions. Immediately after the interventions, VAS-2, VAS-3, and VAS-4 were applied. In addition, following the intervention made at 6-7 cm cervical dilatation, The State Anxiety Scale (STAI-I) was applied between the contractions. After the interventions were completed, CCQ was applied again at 8-9 cm cervical dilatation. The pregnant women in the control group were administered VAS-2, VAS-3, and VAS-4 at 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm, and 8-9 cm cervical dilatations, STAI-I at 6-7 cm cervical dilatation, and CCQ at 8-9 cm cervical dilatation.

Measurement tools The study data were collected through The Pregnant Information Form, VAS, Partograph Form, Childbirth Comfort Scale, and the State Anxiety Scale.

The Pregnant Information Form (PIF): The form consists of 22 questions inquiring about the sociodemographic, gynecological, and obstetric characteristics of the pregnant women.

Visual Analog Scale (VAS): The scale was used in order to measure labor pain. It is made up of a vertical line ranging from 0 to 10. In the study, VAS was applied before the intervention at 4-5 cm cervical dilatation (VAS-I) and after the intervention at 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm, and 8-9 cm cervical dilatations (VAS-2, VAS-3, VAS-4, respectively).

Childbirth Comfort Questionnaire (CCQ): The 9-item scale is a 5-point Likert type scale (1=Absolutely Disagree, 5=Absolutely Agree). The score to be obtained from the scale ranges between 9-45. A high score indicates a high level of comfort. In the present study, this value for the scale was determined to be 0.72. CCQ was applied two times in the study, once at 4-5 cm cervical dilatation before the intervention and once at 8-9 cm dilatation after the intervention.

State Anxiety Scale (STAI-I): The 4-point Likert type scale (1=Almost Never, 4=Almost Always) consists of 20 questions. There are two types of statements on the scale. Direct statements express negative emotions, while reverse statements express positive emotions. Weighted total score is calculated for both direct and reverse statements. The totals score obtained from negative statements is subtracted from the total score obtained from positive statements. A pre-determined constant number (50) is added to this number obtained. The final score obtained is the individual's anxiety score. The scores obtained from the scale varies between 20 and 80. A high score shows a high level of anxiety.

Intervention Ice massage was applied to the SP6 points (SP6 point is located 3-4 fingers above the posterior malleolus bone, that is, 4 fingers above the ankle) of the pregnant women in first stage of childbirth at 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm, and 8-9 cm cervical dilatations during 3 contractions. In order to prevent direct contact of ice with the skin, ice was applied as ice cubes wrapped in gauze. Standard midwifery care was provided to the women in both groups. In the hospital where the study was conducted, cervical dilatation and effacement follow-up, contraction and fetal heart rate follow-up, vital signs monitoring, and routine oxytocin induction are applied as standard midwifery care. In addition, pregnant women are provided with information on breathing and pushing techniques. 4 drop/min 10IU/ml oxytocin induction was applied to all pregnant women in both groups at 4-5 cm cervical dilatation. Oxytocin induction was increased by 4 drops at every 20 minutes. It was applied at a maximum dose of 40 drop/min.","Inclusion Criteria:

Measurement Tools: The Pregnant Information Form, VAS, the Partograph Form, Childbirth Comfort Questionnaire (CCQ), and the State Anxiety Scale were used to collect data. The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial in the Delivery Room of Ataturk City Hospital located in Balikesir province of Turkey between December 2021 and July 2022. Participants The study sample size was calculated by using G\*Power 3 power calculations based on previous studies in which ice massage was applied to acupressure points during labor. Impact estimation was obtained from the findings of the study conducted by Hajiamini et al., who reported pain severity as 5.90 ± 1.84 in the ice massage group and 7.10 ± 1.64 in the control group 30 minutes after the ice massage application. In the present study, it was aimed to determine a similar difference. The sample size for each group was determined to be at least 47 individuals. Accordingly, 50 primiparas were assigned to the intervention group and the control group each. The power analysis performed showed that the sample size of the study had a power as α = 0.05, Power = 0.91, df = 98. The decrease observed in labor pain at 4-5 cm cervical dilatation compared to the control group had an impact size of 0.61.

Rambam Health Care Campus,OTHER,NCT01863979,New Causes and Predictors for the Development of Atrial Fibrillation and Its Complications,New Causes and Predictors for the Development of Atrial Fibrillation and Its Complications,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and its prevalence increases with aging of the population. It is reflected in the ECG recording by the replacement of regular P-waves by an undulating baseline and irregular ventricular complexes \[2\]. The uncoordinated atrial activity prevents effective atrial contraction, leading to clot formation. Atrial fibrillation contributes significantly to population morbidity and mortality, and presently available therapeutic approaches have major limitations, including limited efficacy and potentially serious side effects. It can be classified into one of the three following categories:

1. Paroxysmal: self-termination within 7 days
2. Persistent: requires termination by pharmacological or direct-current electric cardioversion
3. Permanent: restoration to sinus rhythm is impossible or inadvisable

It is believed that in many cases the natural history of AF involves evolution from paroxysmal to persistent to permanent forms through the influence of atrial remodeling caused by the arrhythmia itself and/or progression of underlying heart disease. As many underlying conditions contribute to the development and progression of AF, the full and exact mechanisms standing behind this common arrhythmia are not completely or sufficiently understood.

Thromboembolism is by far the most important complication of AF, and the most common factor in stroke in the elderly. The determinants of Virchow triad, including stasis, endothelial damage, and coagulation properties, are centrally involved in AF- related thrombus formation.

Odense University Hospital,OTHER,NCT00145379,The Effect of Metformin in Overweight Patients With Dysregulated Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,The Effect of Metformin in Overweight Patients With Dysregulated Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,"Patients suffering from diabetes through many years have a risk of developing late diabetic complications including changes in eyes, kidney, vessels and nerves. Late complications can be postponed or avoided when assuring a good diabetes control, i.e. sensible diet, exercise, frequent blood glucose measurements and a good medical treatment.

Blood glucose regulation depends on two different factors i.e. the insulin need of the body and the amount of insulin in the body. The amount of insulin, in blood, is decided by the amount of insulin infused daily, whereas the insulin need depends on the patient's weight, physical activity and diet. Overweight type 2 diabetes patients have a large insulin need and especially this need is decisive for their development of diabetes. If these patients are treated with Metformin, blood glucose decreases and the result is an easier weight loss for the patient. Especially, when these patients take this drug, the development of late diabetic complications, especially arteriosclerosis, can be avoided or postponed.

Whether these favourable effects of Metformin are also present in type 1 diabetic patients remains to be fully clarified, but some studies have indicated that this is the case. This results in a better regulation of diabetes on a smaller insulin dose than the one given to the patients before.

Metformin probably takes effect by increasing the glucose uptake in muscles and by reducing the hepatic glucose production. The drug usually has no side-effects, but some patients do, however, suffer from abdominal pain, small tendency to nausea, loose defaecation and a metallic taste in the mouth. These side-effects are often temporary.

Project description

In total, 50 type 1 diabetic patients are offered to participate in the project. All are from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Endocrinology. The project lasts 7 months divided as follows:

1. An introductory period of one month introducing an optimisation of the insulin treatment
2. A 6 month period (in which neither the patients nor the treating doctor know which medication is given) with either T. Metformin treatment twice daily or T. Placebo (lime) twice daily together with the usual insulin treatment four times daily.

Choice of either T. Metformin or T. Placebo will be made by draw, and as stated above, the drug type will be unknown for both the patient and the treating doctor in order to make sure that the investigation is as objective as possible.

Throughout the examination period, the patients are asked to measure blood glucose four times daily, i.e. before main meals and before bed time. These values will be used for regulating the fasting insulin dose with help from the treating doctor, and for adjusting the daily insulin dose. During the first and the last two days of the examination period we will also ask the patients to measure blood glucose at 03h00 for two days. Those diurnal profiles will be included in the evaluation of the blood glucose control during the treatment period. Furthermore, the patients' blood pressures are determined during 24 hours before and after the 6 months' treatment period. This will be carried out automatically by means of a blood pressure cuff around the arm connected to a small apparatus registering the values during 24 hours. The apparatus can be taken home after installation at the outpatient clinic and can be carried around in a belt around the waist until next day where the apparatus will be dismantled.

At the first and the last of 5 outpatient visits, blood tests will be taken (for evaluation of the long-term blood glucose, kidney, liver, insulin and fat in blood) and nocturnal urine must be collected and disposed in order to evaluate protein secretion and thereby kidney function.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Late complications can be postponed or avoided when assuring a good diabetes control, i.e. sensible diet, exercise, frequent blood glucose measurements and a good medical treatment. Blood glucose regulation depends on two different factors i.e. the insulin need of the body and the amount of insulin in the body. The amount of insulin, in blood, is decided by the amount of insulin infused daily, whereas the insulin need depends on the patient's weight, physical activity and diet. Overweight type 2 diabetes patients have a large insulin need and especially this need is decisive for their development of diabetes. If these patients are treated with Metformin, blood glucose decreases and the result is an easier weight loss for the patient. Especially, when these patients take this drug, the development of late diabetic complications, especially arteriosclerosis, can be avoided or postponed. Whether these favourable effects of Metformin are also present in type 1 diabetic patients remains to be fully clarified, but some studies have indicated that this is the case. This results in a better regulation of diabetes on a smaller insulin dose than the one given to the patients before. Metformin probably takes effect by increasing the glucose uptake in muscles and by reducing the hepatic glucose production. The drug usually has no side-effects, but some patients do, however, suffer from abdominal pain, small tendency to nausea, loose defaecation and a metallic taste in the mouth. These side-effects are often temporary. Project description In total, 50 type 1 diabetic patients are offered to participate in the project. All are from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Endocrinology. The project lasts 7 months divided as follows: 1. An introductory period of one month introducing an optimisation of the insulin treatment 2. A 6 month period (in which neither the patients nor the treating doctor know which medication is given) with either T. Metformin treatment twice daily or T. Placebo (lime) twice daily together with the usual insulin treatment four times daily. Choice of either T. Metformin or T. Placebo will be made by draw, and as stated above, the drug type will be unknown for both the patient and the treating doctor in order to make sure that the investigation is as objective as possible. Throughout the examination period, the patients are asked to measure blood glucose four times daily, i.e. before main meals and before bed time. These values will be used for regulating the fasting insulin dose with help from the treating doctor, and for adjusting the daily insulin dose. During the first and the last two days of the examination period we will also ask the patients to measure blood glucose at 03h00 for two days. Those diurnal profiles will be included in the evaluation of the blood glucose control during the treatment period. Furthermore, the patients' blood pressures are determined during 24 hours before and after the 6 months' treatment period. This will be carried out automatically by means of a blood pressure cuff around the arm connected to a small apparatus registering the values during 24 hours. The apparatus can be taken home after installation at the outpatient clinic and can be carried around in a belt around the waist until next day where the apparatus will be dismantled. At the first and the last of 5 outpatient visits, blood tests will be taken (for evaluation of the long-term blood glucose, kidney, liver, insulin and fat in blood) and nocturnal urine must be collected and disposed in order to evaluate protein secretion and thereby kidney function.

Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,OTHER,NCT01095679,Baclofen and Hypoxia-induced Periodic Ventilation,"Assessment of the Effect of the GABA-B Receptor Agonist, Baclofen, on Hypoxia-induced Periodic Ventilation, in Healthy Subjects","Periodic ventilation that includes CHEYNE Stokes ventilation is a pathological pattern characterized by alternating periods of hyperpneas and apnea-hypopneas. It occurs generally during sleep, at high altitude and in hypoxic conditions in healthy subjects, and in some diseases like congestive heart failure. One study conducted on an animal model suggested that baclofen, a drug already used against spasticity in humans, could also be effective against periodic ventilation. The goal of the study is therefore to assess this hypothesis on hypoxia-induced periodic ventilation in healthy subjects during sleep.","Rationale of the study:

Periodic ventilation, often called CHEYNE Stokes ventilation, results from a dysfunction of the mechanisms of the control of breathing. In this type of ventilation, alternating periods of hyperventilation and apneas and/or hypoventilation replace the normal regular pattern of breathing. Periodic ventilation occurs preferentially during sleep. It is responsible for decreases in arterial saturation in oxygen and for sleep fragmentation. There is currently no consensual treatment but non-invasive nocturnal mechanical ventilation is often used to bring the ventilatory pattern back to normal.

Periodic ventilation occurs in various conditions, the most frequent being cardiac failure. It also occurs in healthy subjects exposed to hypoxia or at high altitude.

The pathophysiology of periodic breathing remains poorly understood. Our hypothesis regarding the mechanisms of this abnormal ventilatory pattern is based on comparative physiology. Periodic ventilation is indeed the usual ventilatory pattern of many lower vertebrates. Moreover, even isolated in VITRO, the tadpole brainstem still produces a periodic ventilatory rhythm, characterized by clusters of ventilatory discharges. In this model, the agonist of the GABA-B receptor, the baclofen, transforms the periodic pattern into a regular one. Of note, the baclofen is already used in the treatment of some human diseases, especially against spasticity.

The hypothesis of the research project assumes that periodic ventilation in humans results from a neural reconfiguration of the networks that command breathing, leading them to produce an ancestral behavior. It also assumes that the baclofen woul reverse this phenomenon as it does in the model of the tadpole isolated brainstem.

The goal of the project is therefore to assess the effect of baclofen on hypoxia-induced periodic ventilation in healthy subjects during sleep. This is thus a pathophysiological study that aimed at demonstrating a concept before a possible clinical trial.

This study is pathophysiological study, conducted in healthy volunteers only.

Methods:

The subjects will sleep in hypoxic conditions, with a level of hypoxia similar to the one that is found at an altitude of 4000-4500 meters. A this altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen is approximately 90-100 mmHg. The hypoxic atmosphere will be created in a tent with an hypoxic generator (EVEREST Summit Hypoxic Generator, Hypoxic Systems, New York, NY, USA).

The electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals and the movements of the chest and of the abdomen will be recorded with a portable polysomnograph. The electromyogram of the chin and the ELECTRO Oculogram will also be recorded. These signals will permit to identify the sleep stages. The subjects will ware a face mask connected to a pneumotachometer for the recording of the ventilatory flow. Gas will also be sampled to measure the end tidal partial pressure of CO2.

Protocol:

Healthy volunteers will be enrolled after they will have given written informed consent. The subjects will be asked about their medical history and physical examination will be performed. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and pulmonary function tests will also be performed.

The subject will be asked not to sleep the night before each recording in hypoxic conditions (the hypoxic sessions). The recordings will be performed either during a nap in the afternoon or at night.

A first hypoxic session will be performed to identify the subjects who will develop periodic ventilation. Only those who will exhibit periodic ventilation during sleep will continue the study. They will be prescribed either baclofen or placebo (double blind, randomized). The posology will be progressively increased (over approximately 10 days) to reach 20 mg 3 times a day, during 3 to 5 days. A second hypoxic session will be performed under this treatment. Then the posology will be decreased over 3 days and a complete weaning will be performed during 5 to 10 days. The same protocol will be repeated, either with baclofen or placebo (depending of the previous run) and a third hypoxic session will be performed. The posology will then be decreased over 3 days and the study will be considered ended for the subject after 2 more days of complete weaning.

The maximum duration of the study for one subject will be 63 days.","Inclusion Criteria:

The pathophysiology of periodic breathing remains poorly understood. Our hypothesis regarding the mechanisms of this abnormal ventilatory pattern is based on comparative physiology. Periodic ventilation is indeed the usual ventilatory pattern of many lower vertebrates. Moreover, even isolated in VITRO, the tadpole brainstem still produces a periodic ventilatory rhythm, characterized by clusters of ventilatory discharges. In this model, the agonist of the GABA-B receptor, the baclofen, transforms the periodic pattern into a regular one. Of note, the baclofen is already used in the treatment of some human diseases, especially against spasticity. The hypothesis of the research project assumes that periodic ventilation in humans results from a neural reconfiguration of the networks that command breathing, leading them to produce an ancestral behavior. It also assumes that the baclofen woul reverse this phenomenon as it does in the model of the tadpole isolated brainstem. The goal of the project is therefore to assess the effect of baclofen on hypoxia-induced periodic ventilation in healthy subjects during sleep. This is thus a pathophysiological study that aimed at demonstrating a concept before a possible clinical trial. This study is pathophysiological study, conducted in healthy volunteers only. Methods: The subjects will sleep in hypoxic conditions, with a level of hypoxia similar to the one that is found at an altitude of 4000-4500 meters. A this altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen is approximately 90-100 mmHg. The hypoxic atmosphere will be created in a tent with an hypoxic generator (EVEREST Summit Hypoxic Generator, Hypoxic Systems, New York, NY, USA). The electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals and the movements of the chest and of the abdomen will be recorded with a portable polysomnograph. The electromyogram of the chin and the ELECTRO Oculogram will also be recorded. These signals will permit to identify the sleep stages. The subjects will ware a face mask connected to a pneumotachometer for the recording of the ventilatory flow. Gas will also be sampled to measure the end tidal partial pressure of CO2. Protocol: Healthy volunteers will be enrolled after they will have given written informed consent. The subjects will be asked about their medical history and physical examination will be performed. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and pulmonary function tests will also be performed. The subject will be asked not to sleep the night before each recording in hypoxic conditions (the hypoxic sessions). The recordings will be performed either during a nap in the afternoon or at night. A first hypoxic session will be performed to identify the subjects who will develop periodic ventilation. Only those who will exhibit periodic ventilation during sleep will continue the study. They will be prescribed either baclofen or placebo (double blind, randomized). The posology will be progressively increased (over approximately 10 days) to reach 20 mg 3 times a day, during 3 to 5 days. A second hypoxic session will be performed under this treatment. Then the posology will be decreased over 3 days and a complete weaning will be performed during 5 to 10 days. The same protocol will be repeated, either with baclofen or placebo (depending of the previous run) and a third hypoxic session will be performed. The posology will then be decreased over 3 days and the study will be considered ended for the subject after 2 more days of complete weaning. The maximum duration of the study for one subject will be 63 days.

Rudy Reindl,OTHER,NCT00597779,Randomized Comparison of 2 Fixation Techniques for Unstable Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures,Extramedullary vs. Intramedullary Devices in the Treatment of Unstable Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures,"The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and radiological outcome of patients that are treated with two different orthopedic implants. The study population will consist of patients that have sustained unstable hip fractures. The two different implants will be randomly assigned.

The null hypothesis states that there should not be any significant differences between the two implants.","Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common injuries in the elderly population. They often signify generalized physical deterioration. Operative management has become the standard of care to prevent life threatening complications and dates back to the 1940's. The design of implants has evolved significantly since then.

The sliding hip screw replaced static fixation of the femoral head in the 1950's. As a result of this improvement in design, failures have been reduced to 9-16%. The sliding hip screw allows for stable collapse of the femoral neck. This can lead to significant shortening of the proximal femur in comminuted fractures.

Current treatment modalities focus on obtaining a satisfactory union of the fracture, often at the expense of anatomical alignment. Severely comminuted fractures treated with a standard plate-hip-screw device thus commonly result in significant degrees of mal-union and shortening. In the past, implants designed to restore and maintain the anatomy of the hip have resulted in high failure rates with the implant breaking out of the femoral head. In the mid 1980's, recognition of this led to the development of various intramedullary devices for fixation of these fractures. The weight-bearing portion of the implant is therefore shifted medially, resulting in reduced lever forces on the implant and femur. Additionally, the IM device does not rely on fixation to the lateral cortex of the femur with screws. From a biomechanical standpoint, the intramedullary device has distinct advantages, as it is a load- sharing device more closely located to the axis of weight bearing than the plate-hip-screw device.

Advances in intramedullary designs have been promising, but the clinical results variable. The relatively high rate of fracture at the tip, specifically at the level of the locking bolts, has hampered the widespread popularity of intramedullary devices. Additionally, the large diameter of the proximal aspect of the implants required extensive reaming of the greater trochanter and partial detachment of the gluteus medius. This may lead to abductor weakness and a Trendelenburg gait. Some studies have found increased re-operation rates for these early hip-nail devices compared to the plate -hip-screw implant. Other studies have shown decreased blood loss and operative time with the nails. A meta-analysis of the literature favors the sliding hip screw design. Unfortunately, most studies focus on radiological failure rate rather than patient function and relate to the first generation of IM devices.

The newest generation of nails (like the IM studied here) has attempted to correct the shortcomings of earlier designs. The proximal aspect of the nail diameter is minimized. The distal locking screw is located far away from the distal end of the nail and the locking bolt is placed in an oblique fashion. Design alterations to the femoral head fixation portion of the nail by using a helical blade rather than a screw may improve fixation in the femoral head. These new designs seem to compare favorably in recent clinical tests. Early mobilization for patients with the intramedullary device (IM) seems to be better.

Results of the pilot study indicate an earlier return to full mobility and shorter operating time in the IM group. This study included all intertrochanteric fracture types and did not demonstrate a clear benefit of the IM in many other parameters. The currently proposed multi-centre study will focus on the unstable A2 intertrochanteric fracture pattern.

Considering the significantly increased cost of the new intramedullary devices compared to the standard plate-hip-screw, a significant overall improvement in patient function should be realized before the general use of these new devices could be recommended.","Inclusion Criteria:

University of Canberra,OTHER,NCT06732479,Behavioural Skills Training (BST) for Teaching Sexual Abuse Prevention Skills for Children with Intellectual Disabilities,Effectiveness of Behavioural Skills Training (BST) on Knowledge of Sexual Abuse and Resistance Ability Among Children with Intellectual Disabilities: a Randomized Controlled Trial,"The main goal of the study was to see if Behavioural Skills Training (BST) could improve knowledge about sexual abuse and the ability to resist it among children with intellectual disabilities. This study also evaluated any negative effects of the programme on children with intellectual disabilities. There were two groups, one group received a training programme which was delivered as three one-hour sessions in a week over 12 weeks. The Behavioral Skills Training (BST) module was structured into ten lessons, each conveyed through engaging stories and corresponding illustrations. The training commenced with teaching children general safety topics such as poison, fire, pedestrian, and vehicle safety. This served as an initial step to establish comfort.

Subsequently, the module transitioned to imparting knowledge on body safety rules. This included educating children on stranger safety and private parts, understanding appropriate and inappropriate touches, and teaching them self-protection skills. Videos were used to show appropriate and inappropriate situations effectively, and training sessions involved role-playing scenarios. Another group received the usual sex education offered by teachers at school. After completing training students were assessed for their knowledge regarding sexual abuse and their self-protection skills (ability to say no, remove themselves from the situation, identify a person to whom the incident can be reported and report the incident and identify the offender. This was assessed based on the situations presented in a video. Children were tested one week after the training, at one-month, three-month and six-month intervals to see whether they could retain the information and skill. Their knowledge and self-protection skills improved after attending the programme and it was retained for six months. Participation in the programme did not cause any negative effects among children with intellectual disabilities.","Sexual abuse of children with intellectual disabilities is a global concern. Rate of sexual abuse among children with intellectual disabilities is 2-4 times the rate in general population. Thirty-nine to 83% of girls and 16%- 32% of boys with Intellectual Disability typically experience sexual abuse by the time they reach the age of 18. There is a need for personal safety programs as one of the multiple approaches to reduce the risk of child sexual abuse. In order to protect themselves against abuse, children with intellectual disability must have the skills to independently recognise potentially abusive situations and respond appropriately. Even though some of the abuse prevention programmes are widely used, the effectiveness of these is not established. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of a Behavioural Skills Training on knowledge of sexual abuse and resistance ability among children with Intellectual Disability.

Sample size calculation for this study was conducted using power analysis, based on the variance from the pilot study. Considering a statistical power of 80% and a significance level set at 5%, 134 children were initially recruited for the study. However, upon concluding the six months, data was available to only 120 subjects. Among these, 60 children received the intervention ( experimental group), while the remaining 60 received Treatment as Usual (the control group).

This study developed a Video based Behavioural Skill Training programme for training children with intellectual disabilities for improving their knowledge regarding sexual abuse and resistance ability against sexual abuse and tested its effectiveness. The study involved children initially watching video presentations depicting appropriate and inappropriate situations and the ideal responses for each scenario. Subsequently, the children engaged in role-playing exercises, where a researcher assumed the roles of a perpetrator, doctor, or nurse. At the same time, parents who participated as co-therapists in the study played their parents' part in the role play. Following each enactment of inappropriate situations, the children were instructed to approach their parents and report the individual's identity and the incident. This role-playing process was reiterated until the children had comprehensively learned the appropriate responses.

The effectiveness of the study was evaluated based on the change in the knowledge scores and resistance ability scores. A randomized controlled design with longitudinal measurement of outcomes was adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of BST on Knowledge of Sexual Abuse and Resistance Ability. Screening for all the children was done in each selected special schools based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All subjects who met the criteria were selected for the study.

The children and parents involved in the study were clearly informed about its purpose and objectives. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents, and an attempt was made to obtain assent from the children. Forty-two percent of the children were able to provide signed assent. Participants were assured that the information they provided would remain confidential. It was also ensured that the BST would not interfere with the children's regular school schedules. The investigator closely monitored the children and their parents during the intervention to address any potential adverse effects.

At the outset of our research project, we initiated meetings with parents and children to establish mutual understanding and rapport. The teachers played a crucial role in interactions with the parents and children. They helped establish contact with the parents and took on the role of introducing us to both the parents and the children. Their support and involvement were instrumental in creating a welcoming and cooperative atmosphere for our research endeavours. During these meetings, we encouraged parents and children to ask any questions they had about the research. This open and transparent dialogue was a valuable foundation for collaborative efforts and ensured that all parties involved were well-informed and comfortable with the research process.

The introduction to the children was facilitated by the class teacher, allowing us to interact with them within the classroom setting before conducting interviews. This preliminary interaction reduced any sense of unfamiliarity or apprehension among the children. Prior to commencing the interviews, we obtained assent from each child. We informed them that we would ask questions about personal safety and protecting themselves in various situations.

Each child was individually interviewed in an open classroom or library, ensuring a comfortable and non-intimidating environment. The administration sequence first involved conducting the Personal Safety Questionnaire (PSQ) and the video-enhanced 'What If Situation Test' (WIST). Both assessments were administered orally, with responses recorded on paper-based tools. The sessions were conducted in small groups, typically consisting of children, within classroom settings, library halls, or auditoriums. It is essential to note that the child's parents also actively participated in these training sessions and were encouraged to reinforce the training at home. Each training session had a duration of approximately 1 hour.

To analyse the data, verbatim interview responses were coded, with scores assigned for each question or item. This systematic approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the children's understanding of personal safety and their ability to respond effectively to various situations.

After the study's completion, the BST was also provided to the control group. Subjects in the experimental and control group was assessed for their knowledge and resistance ability before the intervention and post assessment was done after the intervention. Descriptive statistics were applied for the baseline data. Descriptive statistics includes frequency distributions, mean and median for the central tendency and range and standard deviation. Chi square was done to find the association between the categorical variables. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention program, Mann Whitney U was done to compare the outcome measures between the experimental and control group All the analysis was performed in IBM SPSS statistics 22 and a p-level of \<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Mean age (in years) of the total sample (n=120) was 15.6 ±2.6 and it was 15.3 ± 2.7 in experimental group (n=60) and 15.9 ± 2.5 in control group (n=60). In the sample 59.2% of the children belonged to the category of mild intellectual disabilities and rest were with moderate intellectual disabilities.

The BST was found to be effective in increasing knowledge (P\<0.01) regarding sexual abuse and resistance ability (P\<0.01) against sexual abuse among children with mild or moderate disabilities.","Children

Kuopio University Hospital,OTHER,NCT04577079,Klinik - Intelligent Patient Flow Management,Validation of Intelligent Patient Flow Management System in Kuopio University Hospital Emergency Department,"Digital health technologies (DHT) are increasingly developed to support healthcare systems around the world. However, they are frequently lacking evidence-based medicine and medical validation. There is considerable need in the western countries to allocate healthcare resources accurately and give the population detailed and reliable health information enabling to take greater responsibility for their health. Intelligent patient flow management system (IPFM, product name Klinik Frontline) is developed to meet these needs. In practice, IPFM is used for decision support in the triaging and diagnostic processes as well as automatizing the management of inflow of the patients. The core of the IPFM is a clinical artificial intelligence (AI), which utilizes a comprehensive medical database of clinical correlations generated by medical doctors.

The study population of this research consists of patients from the Emergency Department of Kuopio University Hospital (KUH). Data will be gathered during 2 weeks of piloting, after which the results will be analysed. Anticipated number of patients to the study is minimum of 246 patients, with objective to be several hundreds. When attending to the hospital, patients will report their demographics, background information and symptoms using structured IPFM online form. Patients entering the unit in an ambulance or with need of immediate care of healthcare professionals due to severe and acute conditions are referred similar to normal process to ensure the patient safety. Results obtained from IPFM are blinded from the healthcare professional and IPFM does not affect professional's clinical decision making in any way. The data obtained from IPFM online form and clinical data from the emergency department and KUH will be analysed after the data collection.

The main aim of the research is to validate the use of IPFM by evaluating the association of IPFM output with 1) urgency and severity of the conditions (using Emergency Severity Index \[ESI\], an international triaging protocol for emergency units, and an assessment by triage nurse); and 2) actual diagnoses diagnosed by medical doctors. The main hypotheses of the research are that 1) IPFM is safe and sensitive in evaluating the urgency of the conditions of arriving patients at the emergency department and that 2) IPFM has sufficient correlation of differential diagnosis with actual diagnosis made by medical doctor.","1. Background

   Continuous development of digital technology provides new opportunities also in healthcare area. As healthcare costs are constantly growing both worldwide and in Finland (1), innovations are needed to enhance allocation of limited healthcare resources and to reduce economic burden. Digital health technologies (DHT) have the potential to reduce these costs. They are increasingly developed to support healthcare systems around the world. DHT are, however, often lacking evidence-based medicine (2) and both the importance and the lack of their validation has been acknowledged widely (3, 4).

   Work in triage and urgent care centers is highly demanding, with considerable time pressure. When operating with high patient volumes, acute conditions and severe stress, human errors are likely to result at least at some extent. Physicians have been found to have a \~5 % diagnostic error rate (5) with half of these potentially harmful (6). DHT have been suggested to have a significant role helping both patient management and triage (7), and thus, reducing also potential human errors. For instance, crude online clinical decision support tool has been found to reliably demonstrate emergency triage severity in experimental setting (7).

   The validation of DHT and decision support tools is highly crucial. Tools with false negative rates could have serious consequences when ignoring severe conditions such as cardiac ischaemia (4). DHT should be thorough and optimal in the medical field and their internal and external validity should have been evaluated. Recently, guidelines for evaluating DHT have been published (4). According to guidelines, the first step in the assessment is to show the results in an early observational study in clinical setting. In addition to safety, also efficacy and effectiveness of DHT should be evaluated.

   To meet these needs, Intelligent Patient Flow Management system (IPFM) has been developed to help the user (i.e. patient) and the healthcare professionals to evaluate user's condition and its severity. IPFM enables semi-automated triaging of patients and enhances the management of patient inflow and demand. In addition, IPFM provides written and precise information for the healthcare professionals communicated by the patients themselves of their conditions and symptoms. The core of IPFM is a broad medical database generated by medical doctors, combined with artificial intelligence (AI) and feedback loops for accuracy improvement. In other words, IPFM is an AI-induced triage and decision support tool developed and monitored by medical doctors to help healthcare professionals to evaluate the urgency of the patients. It evaluates user's condition and infers the urgency using user demographics, background information and symptoms.

   The IPFM is developed by a healthcare technology company Klinik Healthcare Solutions Oy and it has already been implemented in over 400 primary care and dental facilities in the Nordics and was recently launched in the United Kingdom and Portugal. It has been previously shown to reduce the costs in primary care by 14 % in overall total service costs of the patients by streamlining the patient flow (8). IPFM is currently classified and registered as a CE class 1 medical device, which requires continuous scientific validation research and systematic development and quality management processes. The system is used according to its intended use in this study and therefore the study does not require permission or registration for FIMEA's clinical device study register.

   Klinik's IPFM (product names Klinik Access, Klinik Frontline) provides a full-stack solution, with interface for patient input, backend for database and algorithm calculations and interface for handling of case outputs for triaging and combined statistics for healthcare staff. IPFM uses medically golden standard Bayesian methodology for inferring the effect of clinical features on the probabilities of the conditions. The severity and the urgency of the condition is inferred using specific severity symptoms and by setting a threshold for the probabilities of relevant conditions. All inflow of data is dynamically gathered and analysed ensemble and visualised, which can be used by (management) staff to monitor and optimally meet demand ad hoc.
2. Aims and objectives

   The main aim of this study is to validate the use of IPFM in a hospital setting by evaluating the association of IPFM output with 1) clinical urgency and severity of the conditions (using Emergency Severity Index \[ESI\], an international triaging protocol for emergency units, and an assessment by triage nurse); and 2) actual diagnoses made by the hospital doctors. The objective is also to assess the correlation of IPFM output with redirection or referral to various specialties (e.g. internist or surgeon).

   Main hypotheses are:
   * IPFM is safe (\< 1 % emergency cases missed) and accurate (\> 80 % agreement with triaging nurse) in evaluating the urgency of the conditions of arriving patients at the emergency department
   * IPFM has sufficient correlation (\> 60 % overlap) of differential diagnosis with actual diagnosis diagnosed by medical doctor

   Validating IPFM, an AI-induced triage support and decision support tool, in real-life environment and in hospital setting is essential for its use in hospitals and clinical work in the future to support evidence-based medicine. An accurate and efficient tool will decrease delays of treatment of urgent conditions and has the potential to decrease human errors that are inevitable in environment with high patient volumes, acute conditions and severe stress. When in full implementation, it can also help to optimize emergency department resources and to target them more accurately. In addition, this study provides important information on patient history and symptoms provided by patients themselves when entering emergency department compared to clinical data.
3. Materials and methods

   The study population consists of patients entering the emergency department of Kuopio University Hospital (KUH) during a 2-week research period. The calculated needed sample size is a minimum of 246 patients (confidence level 95%, margin of error 5%, study population proportion 80%). The data consists of registry data from the electronic health records, other quantitative data (such as extracts from KUH emergency department reporting software) and qualitative data acquired through observation. Both qualitative and statistical methods will be applied to the data to infer outcomes.

   Case-specific information in the IPFM (demographics, background information, symptoms) provided by the patient will be analyzed with clinical data (Emergency Severity Class index (ESI), triage category, diagnoses) collected from the electronic patient records of the hospital (emergency and other possible departments) and IPFM professional dashboard, and the safety, specificity and sensitivity of IPFM output are analyzed.

   The urgency of the condition is evaluated by IPFM and the analyses with clinical data and validation will be performed after the data collection. They urgency is evaluated by IPFM as: 1. suitable for self-care if no prescription medication or other treatment is suggested (i.e. doesn't require doctor's evaluation, however might benefit from nurse check-up and advice); 2. non-urgent if ailment is prolonged or chronic, but benefits from doctor's evaluation and would more efficiently be managed through non-urgent appointment (\> 3 days); 3. urgent if ailment is (semi-)acute and benefits from doctor's evaluation within 1-3 days; and 4. emergency if ailment requires evaluation and treatment within the same day (or immediately) to avoid risk of serious health hazard. This output is correlated with the ESI classification used by KUH emergency and other data collected from electronic health records regarding urgency of the condition.

   When attending to the hospital, patients will report their demographics, background information, symptoms, other case specific data and satisfaction using structured IPFM online form. Patients entering the unit in an ambulance or with need of immediate care due to severe and acute conditions are managed through traditional process: they do not fill the form and, hence, are out of scope of the pre-evaluation process and this study. All information gathered is transferred to the IPFM dashboard, where the patient reported clinical information, AI-induced suggestions on the urgency of the care needed and potential diagnosis (a differential of 3-10 probable diagnosis) is demonstrated. However, in this study design, healthcare professionals cannot see any clinical information in the IPFM dashboard, i.e. the output of IPFM is blinded.

   Patient data will be saved to the registry from IPFM: 1) age; 2) gender; 3) duration of the symptoms; 4) body location of the symptoms; 5) symptoms chosen from the symptom cloud(s) by the patient (symptom cloud is dynamic, consist of 430 potential symptoms, symptom selection varies depending on the previous actions of the patient); 6) severity symptoms chosen from the severity symptom cloud (severity symptom cloud is dynamic, consist of 100 potential severity symptoms, selection varies depending on the previous actions of the patient); 7) free text fields regarding the selected symptoms; 8) answers (yes/no) to the questions: a) have you used any medication or other treatment for your ailment, b) has someone (e.g. a physician or a physiotherapist) already examined or treated your ailment; 9) identification number of the form; 10) unique case id number; 11) name; 12) social security number; and 13) telephone number.

   After the primary IPFM data collection stage at the beginning of each ER visit, a secondary stage of data retrieval is initiated after the study period. During this only critical information required to assess the validity of the IPFM system outcomes will be fetched from the electronic health care system: 1) ESI classification; 2) diagnosis/diagnoses of the patient; 3) speciality \& care path chosen in the urgency care; 4) traditional non-ESI urgency assessment comparable to our urgency scale (if stored). The final data points will be equivalent to these, but might due to changes in ER practices and/or data systems vary. The data points are chosen to optimally allow comparative analysis of results. This information is only used after data collection when evaluating the validity of IPFM.

   Despite excluding patients with need of acute immediate care of healthcare professionals (arriving with an ambulance), also children/adolescents and patients with otherwise restricted capabilities or developmental disorders are excluded from the study. Adult patients with mild mental disorders can be included, excluding the patients with guardian. Additionally, pregnant or breastfeeding patients are excluded from the study.
4. Ethical aspects of the research

   Participation to the study is voluntary for the patients. After receiving oral and written information on location at KUH emergency department, patients will sign an informed consent form. As described in the chapter 5, the study protocol will not harm any study subjects and will not interfere negatively in their treatment. The patients participate in the study only once, on location when arriving to the emergency department, and thus no further activity nor financial burden is generated.

   An independent research data registry will be generated for this study. When creating the registry, social security number or telephone number is used to merge the data from electronic health records and IPFM. After the data has been merged and the combined registry is created, randomly generated case ids are used as research subject identifiers and information that allows for identification of single patients is not available. The merging of the data is done by the KYS staff prior to access into research registry being granted for the research group. The combined research registry will be stored in a digital format, on a computer owned only by the research group members. There will be a password protection for a user to enter a) the computer and b) the registry file itself. The file will be stored on a local folder not accessed online (i.e. not a cloud storage folder). The registry file will be stored for five (5) years after the research has deemed finished and will be deleted after the period according to the required handling standards. The administrator of the case ids is the person responsible of the project and Klinik Healthcare Solutions Oy is responsible for storing the registry file. The study will be registered into international ""ClinicalTrials.gov"" research register. The results of this project will be reported in a group level and, thus, no individual information can be recognized.

   The application for the ethical committee will be submitted in May 2020.
5. Risk assessment

   The healthcare professionals are evaluating the patients by their own clinical judgement and they do not utilize output of IPFM in their decision making. IPFM data is only assessed after the data collection.

   There is a potential risk of acquiring volunteers below the intended volume for the study. This will be addressed by extending the study period or overlap of daily working hours.

   There is a hypothetical risk of causing undesired delay in the registration process of the patients that would cause critical cases to be missed due to increased waiting times for the registration. Our previous user studies have shown that filling out the IPFM form takes circa 3-5 minutes, which would not be a life threatening delay for walk-in patients. This risk will be monitored and if noticed, managed in real time.
6. Time schedule and funding plans

   This study is initially planned to be executed between 1.7.2020 and 30.6.2023. Duration of the data collection is approximately 2 weeks and is designed to complete during fall 2020.

   The project is anticipated to have a small scale economic effect for the parties. The patients in this study will not experience any economic harm. The service provider Klinik Healthcare Solutions Oy will cover for the costs of it's researchers and assisting staff in the form of a moderate hourly pay. The service provider will also provide the digital equipment used in the research in collecting the information from the patients. In the approval of the equipment it will work closely with the ICT department of Kuopio University Hospital District. The hospital or the emergency department will not have any additional costs regarding the research project. There are no additional economical compensations to the researchers or to the study population.
7. Research group, resources and conflicts of interest

   The research group consists of MD, PhD Juhani Määttä (Medical Research Center Oulu, University of Oulu), MD, PhD candidate Petteri Hirvonen (University of Helsinki), MD Rony Lindell (University of Helsinki) and PhD Tero Martikainen, chief doctor of Kuopio University Hospital A\&E department.

   Juhani Määttä, Petteri Hirvonen and Rony Lindell have financial and business interests in Klinik Healthcare Solutions Oy.
8. Expected results and scientific impact

The study is expected to validate high accuracy (i.e. safe and reliable usability) of IPFM tool in KUH hospital context. The results are generalizable to other hospital emergency departments, however with caution by doing contextual analysis and process comparisons prior to implementation considerations. Through assessing IPFM output with data from patient's electronic health records, the study is expected to show: 1) strong correlation of the urgency category; and 2) good correlation between calculated differential diagnosis and the diagnoses of ED or ward doctors. The purpose is to publish the results in internationally recognized medical journals with high quality.

According to our review of the literature on this subject, an AI-supported automation of the inbound patient traffic in an emergency department setting has not been studied previously, especially not in this scale and patient variation. An increasing public and professional interest is arising regarding AI-based solutions to support professionals in their work and decision making. To meet these needs, this study provides and scientifically validates a solution which works semi-independently, taking up initial tasks normally reserved for healthcare professionals. The research group anticipates this being of great interest to the scientific community - and will add to the discussion of the possibilities of the DHT to provide marked cost-effectiveness while not compromising on patient safety and effectiveness of the use of professional resources.","Inclusion Criteria:

Background Continuous development of digital technology provides new opportunities also in healthcare area. As healthcare costs are constantly growing both worldwide and in Finland (1), innovations are needed to enhance allocation of limited healthcare resources and to reduce economic burden. Digital health technologies (DHT) have the potential to reduce these costs. They are increasingly developed to support healthcare systems around the world.

The main question it aims to answer: How much pain did you (patient) experience during SVP-implantation Several other questions will be answered regarding: patient´s perception of the procedure, complication rate, procedure data.

The study contains two groups which will be compared. Control group: will do SVP implantation under local anaesthesia Study group: will do SVP implantation under local anaesthesia and patient-controlled sedation.

The patients are asked to complete a questionnaire postoperatively which contains questions on pain perception and satisfaction.","The study is an open multicentre randomized controlled trial with a study and a control arm in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be randomized to either a control arm of LA for SVP-implantation or a study arm of PCS with propofol and alfentanil as adjunct to LA for SVP-implantation. The aim is to randomize 340 patients with an estimated patient recruitment over 18 months with a following 6 months of data cleaning and analysis. The trial will be performed at two centres; County Hospital Ryhov, Jönköping, Sweden and University Hospital Linköping, Sweden. SVP implantation procedure and perioperative time period is estimated to 2-4 hours. The primary endpoint is assessment of patients´ self-reported pain perception. Secondary outcomes include patient satisfaction, implantation conditions, sedation level, sedative and analgesic medication consumption, procedural time consumption as well as safety aspects, adverse events and estimation of perioperative experience. Participation in the trial ends after telephone inquiry one day postoperatively.

Control arm:

SVP-implantation in LA:

Subcutanous venous ports were introduced in 1981. A SVP is a small device around 3cm in diameter with an injectable membrane buried just under the skin. It is connected to a thin tube with its tip in a large bore vein. Access to the SVP is achieved by puncturing the skin with a needle.

Local anaesthetic causes the absence of pain sensation in the location where applied by decreasing the rate of depolarization and repolarization of excitable membranes such as nociceptors and nerves. The most commonly used solutions are from the amide group differing in pharmacokinetics. In order to reduce a burning sensation on infiltration substances can be combined with sodium bicarbonate. There will be no restrictions in the choice of LA-solution being left up to local practice at participating sites. With the beginning of the procedure LA is subcutaneously applied to patients in both groups. LA used at participating centres are Mepivacaine 10mg/ml, 20-40ml subcutaneously or Lidnocaine 10mg/ml, 20-40 ml subcutaneously.

Study arm:

SVP-implantation in LA and PCS:

In addition to LA, patients in the study group are able to self-administer a combination of propofol and alfentanil using a patient-controlled sedation pump. The pump enables the patient via a hand-held button to trigger the release of a single bolus of 0.5ml containing 4.5mg propofol and 25µg alfentanil under an 10 second period. This results in a maximal possible amount of 6 bolus doses per minute.

Propofol is a short-acting anaesthetic agent commonly used for general anaesthesia and procedural sedation. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed both through potentiation of GABAA receptor activity and in higher doses behaving as GABAA receptor agonist. When used for intravenous sedation a single dose wears off within minutes demanding for continuous or intermittent application.

Alfentanil is a short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic agent with rapid onset of effects at µ-opioid receptors. These properties make it suitable to provide analgesia for brief procedures and to infuse for longer procedures and yet provide relatively rapid recovery.

Rescue sedation will be available to patients in both groups on the patient´s or operator´s demand. Rescue sedation consists of propofol and alfentanil administered by the clinician and is documented in the e-CRF.

Setting:

This trial will be carried out in the following anaesthesia departments:

OP/IVA clinic, County Hospital Ryhov, Sweden AnOpIVA clinic, University Hospital Linköping, Sweden

Participants will be instructed on use of the PCS pump (Syramed µSP6000, Arcomed AG, Switzerland) by a nurse anesthetist. The syringe is loaded with 36 ml propofol (10 mg/ml) and 4 ml alfentanil (0.5 mg/ml). Each time the patient presses the handheld button, an aliquot of 0.5 ml is injected (4.5 mg propofol/0.025 mg alfentanil). The injection time is set to 10 s, restricting self-administration to a maximum of 6 bolus doses per minute corresponding to 27 mg propofol and 0.15 mg alfentanil per minute. No lockout period is applied. Local anaesthesia is injected in the operating site. Vital parameters prior to the procedure are recorded. Patients are monitored using electrocardiography for heartrate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiratory rate (RR) at 5-min intervals during the procedure. Bradycardia is defined as HR \<40 beats/min, tachycardia as HR \>100 beats/min, hypotension as systolic BP \< 90 mmHg or a decrease of \>30% from baseline, hypoxia as SpO2 \<90% or a decrease of \>5% from baseline, and bradypnea as RR of \<8 breaths per minute. Supplemental oxygen via a capnograph-fitted nasal cannula is administered to all patients at 2 L/min during the procedure. The Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score (OAA/S) \[9\] is used to determine the sedation level during the four procedural steps: 1) sterile swabbing, 2) injection of LA, 3) catheter tunneling, and 4) sterile drape removal. The operating anesthesiologist assesses the operating conditions on a 4 point scale with 1 enabling the operator to perform the procedure without time delay and 4 having to abort the procedure. Puncture attempt is defined as continuous needle advancement to establish vein puncture. An unvalidated patient perception assessment tool with seven dimensions applying the NRS is used to evaluate patient perception. QoR-15 will be measured att 3 timepoints. Preoperatively, postoperatively before patient discharge and one day postoperatively.

QoR- 15 data sampling was planned a priori to the trial start of PACSPI 2. QoR-15 data was listed as secondary outcome in the protocol and on clinicaltrials.gov. After study commencement we became aware of the importance of not only reporting overall QoR-15 score but even recovery time trajectories for the separate time periods within the allocated groups. Moreover, since QoR-15 is a composite score, positive scores in some domains may be counterbalanced by negative scores in other domains, therefore reporting an aggregate score may cause loss of potentially important, more granular data. To specifically address these questions, we will conduct a pre-planned substudy addressing the trajectories of recovery and domain by domain changes.","Inclusion Criteria:

King's College London,OTHER,NCT05456984,The PsychOsis and Diabetes Service Model (PODS) Population Profile Study.,The PsychOsis and Diabetes Service Model (PODS) Population Profile Study.,"People with severe mental illness (SMI), defined as psychotic and bipolar disorders, die 17-20 years earlier than the general population, the most common cause of death being cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The major contributor to CVD mortality in SMI is the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to the general population. T2D is a paradigm of a single condition that progresses to multiple conditions. T2D requires annual reviews of 9 diabetes care processes and for patients to adopt multiple self-care tasks to prevent diabetes complications. The 9 diabetes care processes include: 3-6 monthly blood glucose measurement (HbA1c) with appropriate targets; blood pressure measurements and targets depending on diabetes complication status; annual blood cholesterol measurement; kidney function testing with urinary albumin; kidney function testing with serum creatinine; weight check; smoking status; diabetes annual eye screening; and annual foot examination.

In the National Diabetes Audit 2016-17, people with SMI and T2D were 10% less likely to take up all 9 diabetes care processes and have worse glycaemic control as a result. Therefore the aim of this study is to determine who is receiving these care processes and to develop new care pathways/interventions that support this population.

This project is a cross-sectional study and will take place in Lambeth south London, an area with high prevalence of SMI, and therefore T2D, and deprivation. W aim to profile the entire population of people with SMI and T2D within the Hills Brook and Dales and StockWELL Primary Care Networks. The investigators will access the participants medical records and record details of their latest physical health assessment and ask them to complete 7 validated questionnaires and brief informal interview either face to face in their GP surgery or over the phone. This project has been funded by the Burdett Trust for Nursing.","The practice manager at each participating GP practices will run a combined search using read codes for SMI and for type 2 diabetes on the Egton Medical Information System (EMIS) electronic patient record. This will generate a list/register of all the people who potentially meet the study inclusion criteria. Next GPs or practice staff will invite the potentially eligible to participate in the study by sending them a letter and the participant information sheet. The participant will be asked to contact the research team if they would like to participate or have any further questions. If they agree to the study they receive an information sheet and consent form and will have the opportunity to ask the research team about the study.

It is expected that the total of eligible participants will be 578 from HBD and 472 for StockWELL PCN. This is because HBD PCN have a total of 57,863 patients and StockWELL have 47,199. Type 2 diabetes prevalence for Lambeth is around 5% and there are 5253 people with diabetes from the 2 PCNs which means that based on the estimated prevalence of SMI and T2D in primary care of 20%, the total population of potentially eligible participants will be in the region of 1,000. It is anticipated that 20% of people will respond to the study invitation which would mean a total population of around 200 and depending on the time available to recruit participants and the rate at which GP practices join the study and run the searches, the investigators aim to recruit at least 120 within the study period.

This will be a population-based cross-sectional survey of the total population of people with SMI and T2D registered with HBD PCN and StockWELL PCN. The research team will carry out a case note review of identifiable electronic medical records at the clinical site, information that will be selected will include the date of both diagnoses, duration of both diagnoses and medication history after consent has been obtained. This information will be written in a pseudoanonymised case report form with an ID number replacing patient identifiers and will then be kept in a locked filling cabinet in James Clerk Maxwell Building, King's College London.

The research team will ask the participant to complete 7 validated questionnaires (Diabetes Distress Scale, International Physical Activity Scale, Quality of Life Scale, self-report Global Assessment of Functioning, Alcohol Usage Disorders Identification Test, Drug Abuse Screening Test and Empower Up). This will be done either over the phone or in person and the participants GP surgery, depending on their preference.

The GP Practice will be asked to conduct a routine physical health assessment on the participant, if they have not had one in the last 3 months. This would be part of their routine clinical care and consist of HbA1c (mmol/mol); BP (mmHg); eGFR (mL/min); cholesterol (mmol/mol); BMI (m/kg2).

The research worker will then conduct a brief interview, they will rate the severity of psychiatric symptoms using a validated rating scale and they will discuss how the participant accesses support for diabetes self-management, whether they have any experience of digital interventions and their thoughts on them and finally, preferences on where and how, they receive their diabetes support. This will be carried out either over the phone or in person, depending on the participants preference and will take about 30 minutes.

The PsychOsis and Diabetes Service Model (PODS) Population Profile Study. People with severe mental illness (SMI), defined as psychotic and bipolar disorders, die 17-20 years earlier than the general population, the most common cause of death being cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The major contributor to CVD mortality in SMI is the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to the general population. T2D is a paradigm of a single condition that progresses to multiple conditions. T2D requires annual reviews of 9 diabetes care processes and for patients to adopt multiple self-care tasks to prevent diabetes complications. The 9 diabetes care processes include: 3-6 monthly blood glucose measurement (HbA1c) with appropriate targets; blood pressure measurements and targets depending on diabetes complication status; annual blood cholesterol measurement; kidney function testing with urinary albumin; kidney function testing with serum creatinine; weight check; smoking status; diabetes annual eye screening; and annual foot examination. In the National Diabetes Audit 2016-17, people with SMI and T2D were 10% less likely to take up all 9 diabetes care processes and have worse glycaemic control as a result. Therefore the aim of this study is to determine who is receiving these care processes and to develop new care pathways/interventions that support this population. This project is a cross-sectional study and will take place in Lambeth south London, an area with high prevalence of SMI, and therefore T2D, and deprivation. W aim to profile the entire population of people with SMI and T2D within the Hills Brook and Dales and StockWELL Primary Care Networks. The investigators will access the participants medical records and record details of their latest physical health assessment and ask them to complete 7 validated questionnaires and brief informal interview either face to face in their GP surgery or over the phone. This project has been funded by the Burdett Trust for Nursing. The practice manager at each participating GP practices will run a combined search using read codes for SMI and for type 2 diabetes on the Egton Medical Information System (EMIS) electronic patient record. This will generate a list/register of all the people who potentially meet the study inclusion criteria. Next GPs or practice staff will invite the potentially eligible to participate in the study by sending them a letter and the participant information sheet. The participant will be asked to contact the research team if they would like to participate or have any further questions. If they agree to the study they receive an information sheet and consent form and will have the opportunity to ask the research team about the study. It is expected that the total of eligible participants will be 578 from HBD and 472 for StockWELL PCN. This is because HBD PCN have a total of 57,863 patients and StockWELL have 47,199. Type 2 diabetes prevalence for Lambeth is around 5% and there are 5253 people with diabetes from the 2 PCNs which means that based on the estimated prevalence of SMI and T2D in primary care of 20%, the total population of potentially eligible participants will be in the region of 1,000. It is anticipated that 20% of people will respond to the study invitation which would mean a total population of around 200 and depending on the time available to recruit participants and the rate at which GP practices join the study and run the searches, the investigators aim to recruit at least 120 within the study period. This will be a population-based cross-sectional survey of the total population of people with SMI and T2D registered with HBD PCN and StockWELL PCN. The research team will carry out a case note review of identifiable electronic medical records at the clinical site, information that will be selected will include the date of both diagnoses, duration of both diagnoses and medication history after consent has been obtained. This information will be written in a pseudoanonymised case report form with an ID number replacing patient identifiers and will then be kept in a locked filling cabinet in James Clerk Maxwell Building, King's College London. The research team will ask the participant to complete 7 validated questionnaires (Diabetes Distress Scale, International Physical Activity Scale, Quality of Life Scale, self-report Global Assessment of Functioning, Alcohol Usage Disorders Identification Test, Drug Abuse Screening Test and Empower Up). This will be done either over the phone or in person and the participants GP surgery, depending on their preference. The GP Practice will be asked to conduct a routine physical health assessment on the participant, if they have not had one in the last 3 months. This would be part of their routine clinical care and consist of HbA1c (mmol/mol); BP (mmHg); eGFR (mL/min); cholesterol (mmol/mol); BMI (m/kg2). The research worker will then conduct a brief interview, they will rate the severity of psychiatric symptoms using a validated rating scale and they will discuss how the participant accesses support for diabetes self-management, whether they have any experience of digital interventions and their thoughts on them and finally, preferences on where and how, they receive their diabetes support. This will be carried out either over the phone or in person, depending on the participants preference and will take about 30 minutes. If the participant lacks capacity to consent, they will be asked to consent again in a few weeks to see whether capacity has been restored. If the participant still lacks capacity or they lose capacity during the study, the participant or clinical team will be asked to elect a personal or professional and consultee.

Columbia University,OTHER,NCT01926379,ENhance Initiation and Retention in Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) Care for HIV Study (ENRICH Study),A Combination Intervention Package for Isoniazid Preventive Therapy in Ethiopia,"The purpose of the ENRICH study is to evaluate a combination intervention package (CIP) designed to improve implementation of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Ethiopia. The study is a two-arm cluster randomized trial, randomized at the HIV clinic level, which includes 10 HIV clinics in Dire Dawa and Harari, Ethiopia. Clinics are randomized to deliver the combination intervention package (CIP) or standard of care (SOC), with stratification by facility size (\<80 or \>80 patients enrolled in HIV care per year). The experimental intervention will be delivered to all patients in HIV clinics randomly assigned to CIP who initiated HIV care at the CIP site on or after January 1, 2013 and initiated IPT on or after date of study initiation, July 1, 2013. In HIV clinics assigned to SOC, usual care procedures for provision of IPT will be delivered.

Study Aims and Hypotheses

Aim 1. Characterize and compare the effectiveness of a combination intervention package with standard of care for IPT provision in Ethiopia.

Hypothesis 1.1: IPT initiation for new patients enrolling in HIV care at CIP clinics will be higher than that for newly enrolled patients at SOC clinics.

Hypothesis 1.2: Adherence to and completion of IPT for participants initiating IPT at CIP clinics will be higher than that for those initiating IPT at SOC clinics.

Aim 1a. Assess acceptability of CIP among participants enrolled in HIV care and healthcare providers at CIP clinics. Acceptability will include: 1) perceived barriers and facilitators of uptake and delivery of the intervention package among healthcare providers, and 2) acceptability and utilization of intervention components as well as the overall intervention package among IPT initiators and non-initiators.

Aim 2. Assess the impact of CIP compared with SOC on HIV-related outcomes.

Hypothesis 2: HIV-related outcomes for participants receiving IPT at CIP clinics will be superior to outcomes in participants receiving care at SOC clinics. HIV-related outcomes to be assessed include retention in care and, among those participants receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), adherence to ART and CD4+ count.

Aim 3. Assess the safety and tolerability of IPT among HIV-infected individuals under routine program conditions in Ethiopia.

Aim 4. Identify patient and program characteristics associated with IPT adherence and completion at SOC sites.

Hypothesis 4.1: IPT adherence and completion will be associated with modifiable patient characteristics, including ART status; knowledge and attitudes about IPT; and social support.

Hypothesis 4.2: IPT adherence and completion will be associated with modifiable program characteristics, including provider/patient ratio, patient tracking, and patient support groups.","The study intervention, combination intervention package (CIP), will contain programmatic, structural and psychosocial components including: 1) health care provider training and mentorship in IPT provision using a clinical algorithm; 2) identification of HIV-infected family members eligible for IPT using a family care enrollment form; 3) review of monitoring data on IPT initiation and adherence during monthly multidisciplinary team meetings; 4) reimbursement of transportation costs to patients for monthly clinic visits; and 5) real-time adherence support using interactive voice response (IVR) via mobile phones and trained peer educators.

Data will be collected from all HIV-infected patients enrolled in HIV care at study sites on or after January 1, 2013; from a subset of patients who initiate IPT and enroll into a measurement cohort (MC); and from program characteristics surveys conducted at the study sites. Routine clinic data from all HIV-infected patients enrolled in HIV care at the 10 participating clinics on or after January 1, 2013 will be used to measure the following outcomes: IPT initiation, completion of IPT, and retention in HIV care. These data will be collected by Research Assistants (RA) by abstracting the following information from the clinic Pre-ART, ART (antiretroviral therapy) and IPT registers during the period of observation on all HIV patients who enrolled in care at a study site on or after January 1, 2013: date of enrollment in HIV care; IPT initiation (yes/no); date of ART initiation (if applicable); IPT outcomes (completion, default, death, stopped, transferred out); TB (tuberculosis) screening results; TB treatment (yes/no); TB treatment outcomes (if applicable); and retention in HIV care.

A measurement cohort of 500 HIV-infected patients initiating IPT on or after July 1, 2013 will be recruited from the 10 clinics (n=250 per study arm). MC participants will be assessed at baseline (enrollment) and monthly intervals for six to nine months, depending on the duration of IPT. Outcomes to be measured among MC participants include: adherence to IPT; adherence to ART (if applicable); change in CD4+ count; and side effects/adverse events. MC participants at both SOC and CIP sites will receive the same assessments. RAs will administer assessments on the day of regularly scheduled clinic visits, including a Baseline interview administered on the day of enrollment (which coincides with the day the participant initiates IPT), monthly follow-up interviews completed throughout IPT, and an end of treatment interview that is completed on the day the participant ends IPT. Participants who miss a study visit will be contacted by study staff and administered the questionnaire over the phone within a 1-week window period of the scheduled clinic visit. RAs will also call the MC participants between clinic visits to conduct unannounced pill counts to assess medication adherence. In addition, 30 MC participants from CIP sites will participate in a qualitative interview to assess feasibility and acceptability of the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, one of the interventions in place at CIP sites. Also, three groups will be recruited from CIP clinics to participate in in-depth interviews: IPT initiators, from among participants in the Measurement Cohort (n =15), IPT non-initiators (n=15), and healthcare providers (nurses and peer educators, n=13). In-depth interviews will assess acceptability and preferences of intervention components as well as reasons for IPT non-initiation.

RAs will conduct an assessment of programmatic activities at each HIV clinic prior to study implementation and on a monthly basis thereafter throughout the study period. Clinics in both conditions will receive the same assessments. The RA will administer a brief semi-structured Program Characteristics survey to the ART nurse, who will be most familiar with the day-to-day operations of the HIV clinic. The survey will assess nurse training and mentorship in IPT initiation and HIV treatment; availability and use of an IPT clinical algorithm, IPT and ART adherence training for peer educators (PEs); IPT health education for patients; availability and use of an IPT treatment literacy curriculum, including a flip chart used by PEs; reimbursement for transportation costs for patients; provision of mobile phones, subscriber identification module (SIM) cards and airtime vouchers for HIV patients on IPT; use of IVR messages for medication and appointment reminders and assessment of medication adherence and side effects; and provision of community-based adherence and side effect monitoring by PEs. These data will be used to assess fidelity with the intervention at CIP sites, as well as to measure any potential contamination at SOC sites.

All clinical care will be performed by the clinic staff (nurses and PEs). All study procedures, including participant interviews, pill counts, medical record abstraction, and program characteristics surveys will be performed by study staff (research assistants). Following routine clinic visits, clinic staff will refer patients initiating IPT to study staff, who will screen for eligibility, obtain informed consent, and enroll consenting eligible patients into the MC. In addition, RAs at CIP sites will provide parts of the intervention, including disbursement of mobile phones, SIM cards, airtime vouchers, and cash for transportation reimbursement to eligible patients.","Measurement Cohort (MC) Eligibility Criteria

The survey will assess nurse training and mentorship in IPT initiation and HIV treatment; availability and use of an IPT clinical algorithm, IPT and ART adherence training for peer educators (PEs); IPT health education for patients; availability and use of an IPT treatment literacy curriculum, including a flip chart used by PEs; reimbursement for transportation costs for patients; provision of mobile phones, subscriber identification module (SIM) cards and airtime vouchers for HIV patients on IPT; use of IVR messages for medication and appointment reminders and assessment of medication adherence and side effects; and provision of community-based adherence and side effect monitoring by PEs. These data will be used to assess fidelity with the intervention at CIP sites, as well as to measure any potential contamination at SOC sites. All clinical care will be performed by the clinic staff (nurses and PEs). All study procedures, including participant interviews, pill counts, medical record abstraction, and program characteristics surveys will be performed by study staff (research assistants). Following routine clinic visits, clinic staff will refer patients initiating IPT to study staff, who will screen for eligibility, obtain informed consent, and enroll consenting eligible patients into the MC. In addition, RAs at CIP sites will provide parts of the intervention, including disbursement of mobile phones, SIM cards, airtime vouchers, and cash for transportation reimbursement to eligible patients.

State University of New York at Buffalo,OTHER,NCT04580979,Natural History Study of FDXR Mutation-related Mitochondriopathy,A Natural History Study of Neurodegeneration and Optic Atrophy Caused by Ferredoxin Reductase Mutations in Pediatric and Adult Patients,The purpose of the study is to systematically characterize the clinical course of the progressive neuropathy and optic atrophy observe in pediatric and adult patients with biallelic mutations in the ferredoxin reductase gene.,"The mitochondrial membrane-associated ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) is a flavoprotein that initiates the mitochondrial electron transport chain by transferring electrons from NADPH to the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 system via the ferredoxins FDX1 or FDX2. In addition to essential roles in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, this pathway is also central to the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. Previously, Dr. Taosheng Huang's research group has identified mutations in the FDXR gene in many individuals who share clinical presentations consistent with a mitochondrial disorder-including ataxia, hypotonia and optic atrophy-and obtained a naturally-occurring Fdxr mutant mouse model from Jackson Lab that corroborated these results (PMID: 29040572 and PMID: 30250212). In particular, FDXR enzyme activity, mitochondrial complex activities and ATP production were all significantly reduced in their patient samples. Their studies further indicated that Fdxr mutation leads to neurodegeneration that is associated with both inflammation as well as the abnormal accumulation of iron in the mitochondria, likely as a result of disrupted Fe-S cluster synthesis. More recently, his group has used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate a mouse line with a p.R389W amino acid change, which more precisely matches the most common human variant observed in their patients and shows a much more severe phenotype than their previous, naturally occurring Fdxr mouse model. They have also show that AAV-based gene therapy can significantly improve the condition of Fdxr mutant mice (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2020.05.021), providing valuable preclinical data that may open the door for adapting such gene therapy treatments for use in human clinical trials. Given the recent regulatory approval granted to gene therapy treatments for LCA2, SMA1, and β-thalassemia, there is strong possibility that such an approach will ultimately produce a viable clinical treatment for FDXR patients as well.

FDXR is required for Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters synthesis which is essential for multiple important biological processes, including electron transfer, cofactor synthesis, and gene regulation. Fe-S cluster biosynthesis is a tightly regulated process that requires coordinated delivery of both iron and sulfur and is a cofactor of many proteins. A variety of human disorders have been associated with impaired Fe-S cluster synthesis, including neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Friedreich's ataxia) and myopathy with lactic acidosis. Iron homeostasis, which requires precise synthesis and localization of Fe-S clusters in mitochondria, is critical to ensure that there is sufficient iron for cellular functions, without reaching toxic levels of iron. Excessive levels of iron favor the formation of excess oxygen free radicals and consequent mitochondrial dysfunction.

The Rare Disease Act and Rare Disease Orphan Product Development Act highlight the importance of rare disease research and the obstacles to developing effective treatments for these diseases. However, the study of rare diseases may open a window to studying other human conditions. For example, Iron-sulfur biosynthesis abnormalities have been observed in more common human diseases such as Friedreich's ataxia. This relationship highlights the importance of human disease research by multiple approaches to understand biological mechanisms and for general application to human health. For these reasons, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of FDXR deficiency may help facilitate our knowledge of disease biology, neurodevelopment, brain function, and other organ abnormalities. Thus, in order to better understand the function of FDXR and to help lay the groundwork for eventual clinical trials of gene therapy or drug-based treatments for FDXR-related disease, the investigators propose this natural history study of both pediatric as well as adult patients with biallelic mutations in the ferredoxin reductase gene.","Inclusion Criteria:

The main goal of this observational clinical study is to extend the traditional use of per-operative EEG to the detection and prediction of various degrees of brain fragility, depending on the depth of anesthesia (DoA).","Main objective : Extend the traditional use of per-operative EEG to the detection and prediction of various degrees of brain fragility, depending on the depth of anesthesia (DoA).

Indices derived from the EEG signal, Spectral Edge Frequency 95 (SEF95), Patient State Index (PSI) and Bi-spectral Index (BIS) are now widely used in the operating room to monitor the Depth of Anesthesia (DoA). Recent studies suggest that variables extracted from per-operative EEG change as brain ages. A detailed reading of the quantitative EEG (qEEG) under GA has been recently described depending both on the specific drug used and patients' age. For GA induced with Propofol (2,6 di-isopropylphenol), a GABAergic receptor agonist used in Total Intra Venous Anesthesia (TIVA), the EEG signal under frontal derivations exhibits a specific signature characterized by a powerful alpha band. However, the elderly attenuates these EEG characteristics, which might be the results of a change in thalamic-cortical function and decreased neuronal excitability.

The goal of this observational clinical study is to assess the fragility of a patient under GA and based on the EEG SEF13 characteristics, weighted by the amount of Propofol administered.

Measures are based on EEG signal and subfrequency power spectral densities including alpha band as well as the amount of Propofol, each measured for EEG periods where SEF 95 = 8-13Hz.

Experimental design: This is a single-center, interventional, category I prospective study (minimal risks and constraints)

Population concerned : Patients eligible for interventional neuroradiology or orthopedic surgery performed under GA are selected to participate in this prospective, observational, single-center, routine care study. Patients will be included if they received, for a non-urgent scheduled procedure, a Total IntraVenous Administration (TIVA) anesthesia by Propofol according to the Schnider model combined with a morphine derivative. Minor patients, pregnant women and patients who refused to provide informed consent are excluded from the study. Patients with a BMI \> 36 kg/m2 for whom the Schnider model is not validated are also excluded. Patient demographics will be collected during the anesthesia consultation. Total IntraVenous Anesthesia (TIVA) and Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) are used for morphine derivative and Propofol, EEG parameters will be collected from frontal electrodes montage (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8).

Research Proceedings : Measures are based on EEG signal through routine EEG-based neuro-monitoring and subfrequency power spectral densities including alpha band as well as the amount of Propofol, each measured for EEG periods where SEF95 = 8-13Hz. Standard monitoring (Pulse Oxygen Saturation: SpO2, Heart Rate: HR, Systolic, Diastolic and Mean Arterial Blood Pressure: SBP, DBP, MAP, Temperature, End tidal CO2: (EtCO2) and electro-encephalogram monitoring by the Masimo Sedline monitor (SEF 95, PSI and BS) will be recorded.

General anesthesia is then induced in a standardized manner with a morphine followed by intra-venous administration of Propofol. All the measures are obtained non-invasively.

Individual benefit: There is no benefit for the patient

Collective benefit: Aging is associated to change in cerebral activity and it's crucial to distinguishes fragile patients from normal ones. The tailoring of doses according to the degree of ""cerebral fragility"" could predict poor postoperative cognitive or behavioral evolution.

Risks and minimal constraints added by the research: No added risk. The procedure is performed according to the usual protocol including routine EEG-based neuro-monitoring All the measures are obtained non-invasively.

For all patients whatever the comorbidities, anesthesia induction will be performed using a target-controlled infusion (Orchestra® Base Primea - Fresenius Kabi France). According to our standard of care, intra-operative episodes of hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) \< 65 mmHg or \< 80% baseline) are treated by Norepinephrine bolus of 10 μg. For all patients, data from EEG-neuromonitoring and hemodynamic data are collected at the end of the procedure.

Number of selected subjects Selection of patients up to 60 analysable patients Number of Centre : 1 Research Agenda inclusion period: 12 months duration of participation (treatment + follow-up): duration of the interventional neuroradiology or orthopedic procedure: 1 day total duration: 12 months Number of planned inclusions by centre and month : 5 Number of subjects required : 60

Statistics The significance level used in this study chose as 0.05. The values is expressed in percentage for qualitative variables and median (InterQuartile Range: \[IQR\]) for quantitative variables. All parameters will be recorded and the brain total power spectral density (PT), alpha band power spectral density (Pα) and the Propofol TCI (µg/ml) will be calculated on the entire population. The median value of Pα,PT,PropofolTCI combination will be compared using non-parametric Kruskal Wallis and Man Whitney tests for quantitative data, while qualitative variable will be analyzed based on the Fisher's test. Research on the correlation between age and brain total power spectral is carried out by Pearson's test.

Then analysis will be also performed according to the occurrence of BS during induction of anesthesia. ROC curves will be constructed from univariate logistic régressions. For each univariate regression investigators provided Odd Ratios (OR) given with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and Areas Under the Curve (AUC). Multivariate analysis is finally performed with a logistic regression model where explanatory variables are chosen according to the results of the univariate analysis (p-value≤0.1).

The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions : Assuming an incidence of 40% BS, with a power at 80% and an alpha risk at 5%, it is necessary to include 60 patients to highlight an area under the ROC curve of 80% with a confidence interval width of 0.1.","Inclusion Criteria:

For GA induced with Propofol (2,6 di-isopropylphenol), a GABAergic receptor agonist used in Total Intra Venous Anesthesia (TIVA), the EEG signal under frontal derivations exhibits a specific signature characterized by a powerful alpha band. However, the elderly attenuates these EEG characteristics, which might be the results of a change in thalamic-cortical function and decreased neuronal excitability. The goal of this observational clinical study is to assess the fragility of a patient under GA and based on the EEG SEF13 characteristics, weighted by the amount of Propofol administered. Measures are based on EEG signal and subfrequency power spectral densities including alpha band as well as the amount of Propofol, each measured for EEG periods where SEF 95 = 8-13Hz. Experimental design: This is a single-center, interventional, category I prospective study (minimal risks and constraints) Population concerned : Patients eligible for interventional neuroradiology or orthopedic surgery performed under GA are selected to participate in this prospective, observational, single-center, routine care study. Patients will be included if they received, for a non-urgent scheduled procedure, a Total IntraVenous Administration (TIVA) anesthesia by Propofol according to the Schnider model combined with a morphine derivative. Minor patients, pregnant women and patients who refused to provide informed consent are excluded from the study. Patients with a BMI \> 36 kg/m2 for whom the Schnider model is not validated are also excluded. Patient demographics will be collected during the anesthesia consultation. Total IntraVenous Anesthesia (TIVA) and Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) are used for morphine derivative and Propofol, EEG parameters will be collected from frontal electrodes montage (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F8). Research Proceedings : Measures are based on EEG signal through routine EEG-based neuro-monitoring and subfrequency power spectral densities including alpha band as well as the amount of Propofol, each measured for EEG periods where SEF95 = 8-13Hz. Standard monitoring (Pulse Oxygen Saturation: SpO2, Heart Rate: HR, Systolic, Diastolic and Mean Arterial Blood Pressure: SBP, DBP, MAP, Temperature, End tidal CO2: (EtCO2) and electro-encephalogram monitoring by the Masimo Sedline monitor (SEF 95, PSI and BS) will be recorded. General anesthesia is then induced in a standardized manner with a morphine followed by intra-venous administration of Propofol. All the measures are obtained non-invasively. Individual benefit: There is no benefit for the patient Collective benefit: Aging is associated to change in cerebral activity and it's crucial to distinguishes fragile patients from normal ones. The tailoring of doses according to the degree of ""cerebral fragility"" could predict poor postoperative cognitive or behavioral evolution. Risks and minimal constraints added by the research: No added risk. The procedure is performed according to the usual protocol including routine EEG-based neuro-monitoring All the measures are obtained non-invasively. For all patients whatever the comorbidities, anesthesia induction will be performed using a target-controlled infusion (Orchestra® Base Primea - Fresenius Kabi France). According to our standard of care, intra-operative episodes of hypotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) \< 65 mmHg or \< 80% baseline) are treated by Norepinephrine bolus of 10 μg. For all patients, data from EEG-neuromonitoring and hemodynamic data are collected at the end of the procedure. Number of selected subjects Selection of patients up to 60 analysable patients Number of Centre : 1 Research Agenda inclusion period: 12 months duration of participation (treatment + follow-up): duration of the interventional neuroradiology or orthopedic procedure: 1 day total duration: 12 months Number of planned inclusions by centre and month : 5 Number of subjects required : 60 Statistics The significance level used in this study chose as 0.05. The values is expressed in percentage for qualitative variables and median (InterQuartile Range: \[IQR\]) for quantitative variables. All parameters will be recorded and the brain total power spectral density (PT), alpha band power spectral density (Pα) and the Propofol TCI (µg/ml) will be calculated on the entire population. The median value of Pα,PT,PropofolTCI combination will be compared using non-parametric Kruskal Wallis and Man Whitney tests for quantitative data, while qualitative variable will be analyzed based on the Fisher's test. Research on the correlation between age and brain total power spectral is carried out by Pearson's test. Then analysis will be also performed according to the occurrence of BS during induction of anesthesia. ROC curves will be constructed from univariate logistic régressions. For each univariate regression investigators provided Odd Ratios (OR) given with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and Areas Under the Curve (AUC). Multivariate analysis is finally performed with a logistic regression model where explanatory variables are chosen according to the results of the univariate analysis (p-value≤0.1). The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions : Assuming an incidence of 40% BS, with a power at 80% and an alpha risk at 5%, it is necessary to include 60 patients to highlight an area under the ROC curve of 80% with a confidence interval width of 0.1. Inclusion Criteria: * Patients \> 18 years scheduled an elective interventional neuroradiology procedure or orthopedic surgery performed under general anesthesia. * oral agreement obtained from each patient before anesthesia Exclusion Criteria: * age \<18 years * an emergency procedure"

National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),NIH,NCT00527579,PET Imaging of Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors in Patients With Neurocysticercosis Using [F-18]FB,PET Imaging of Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors in Patients With Neurocysticercosis Using [F-18]FBR,The purpose of this protocol is to measure peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) and compare the imaging results between patients and healthy people.,"Objective

In endemic regions neurocysticercosis is the most common cause of adult acquired epilepsy and thus an important public health problem. The disease is caused by infection with the larval form of the tapeworm, Taenia solium. Although neurocysticercosis is common only in many developing regions, an increased number of patients are diagnosed in developed countries mostly due to immigration of infected individuals.

The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) can be a clinically useful marker to detect neuroinflammation because activated microglia in inflammatory areas expresses high levels of PBR. PBR has been imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) using \[(11) C\]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195), which provides low levels of specific signal. Recently we developed a new ligand, N-fluroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline (\[(18)F\]FBR), which showed much greater specific signals than \[(11) C\]PK11195 in non-human primates.

The major objective of this protocol is to assess the utility of \[(18) F\]FBR PET to detect neuroinflammation in patients with neurocysticercosis.

A secondary objective is to study whether some healthy subjects do not show binding of \[(18)F\]FBR by performing whole body imaging using \[18F\]FBR and binding assays using blood cells. In other protocols using a PET ligand with similar structure, \[(11)C\]PBR28, approximately 8% of subjects (9/\~ 118 ) did not show binding. In protocols 07-N-0035 and 08-M-0158, we compared binding of \[11C\]PBR28 and \[(11)C\]PK 11195 in approximately ten healthy subjects including five who did not show binding of \[(11)C\]PBR28 in prior whole body imaging. We found differences in organs with regard to sensitivity to the phenomenon of non-binding. In the non-binders, PBR28 showed no binding in all five organs with high PBR density. However, PK 11195 showed significantly reduced binding in only two organs with PBR. We now wish to determine whether PBR06 is more similar to PBR28 or to PK 11195 in terms of the non-binding phenomenon. In the current protocol, in addition to whole body imaging using \[(18)F\]FBR, we will do in vitro binding assays using blood cells as another tissue to examine the effect of non-binding.

Study population

For \[(18)F\]FBR brain scans, ten patients will be recruited and clinically followed under protocol 85-I-0127, Treatment of Cysticercosis including Neurocysticercosis with Praziquantel or Albendazole (PI: Theodore E. Nash, MD, NIAID). Fifteen healthy subjects will be recruited.

For whole body scan using \[(18)F\]FBR, additional 30 healthy subjects will be recruited. Therefore, total accrual numbers are 10 patients with neurocysticercosis and 45 healthy subjects (15 for brain \[(18)F\]FBR and 30 for whole body \[(18)F\]FBR scans.

Design

Ten patients with neurocysticercosis and 15 age-matched healthy subjects will have brain PET scans. In addition, we will also perform a whole body PET scan on 30 healthy subjects to study the radiation-absorbed doses and study whether some healthy subjects do not show binding of \[(18)F\]FBR. Patients will have up to three \[(18)F\]FBR PET scans during the follow-up and the treatment under 85-I-0127, typically a few weeks apart.

Outcome measures

\<TAB\>

In brain PET scans, \[(18)F\]FBR binding will be compared with clinical symptoms and MRI findings. In addition, the binding will be compared between patients and age-matched control subjects. We have calculated radiation absorbed doses in approximately seven healthy subjects who showed normal distribution (i.e., binders) of activity in organs. If we found subjects who appear to have no binding to \[(18)F\]FBR, we will calculate radiation-absorbed doses of the non-binders.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

University of Rochester,OTHER,NCT02932579,Utility of Pharmacogenomic Testing and Postoperative Dental Pain Outcomes,Utility of Pharmacogenomic Testing and Postoperative Dental Pain Outcomes,"Opioid analgesics are the most common postoperative pain medications used among dentists in the United States.Although these medications are highly effective in the postoperative dental pain management, not all patients optimally benefit from this therapy. Many suffer adverse consequences such as nausea, emesis, and psychomotor impairment, and there is a high prevalence of opioid prescription misuse among substance abusers within the dental patient population.

The use of non-opioid analgesics including ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the management of postoperative dental pain has demonstrated equivalent or superior analgesic effects compared to opioid analgesic therapies, typically with significantly less adverse effects.However, despite these results, dentists have encountered a high variability in the success of non-opioid analgesic responses among the postoperative dental pain population.Thus, new strategies for earlier recognition of analgesic responses for pain medications is fundamental in the field of dentistry. Therefore, this study will evaluate the clinical utility of pharmacogenomic testing in acute postoperative dental pain management among healthy adults who undergo extraction of impacted mandibular third molar.","To date, the use of pharmacogenomic methods in medicine has broadened our understanding of the important role of genes and different phenotypes/genotypes that make each individual unique in pain responses, including drug biotransformation, transportation, and drug-related side effects to name a few.Thus, recognizing the genetic profile of each individual prior to the prescription of pain medication for postoperative dental pain management will be essential to provide a more effective and safer pain therapy.Additionally, we suggest that 80% of the individuals in the general population exhibit a genetic profile that influence a normal pain response to non-opioid pain therapies.

University of Florida,OTHER,NCT02780479,Steroids in Children Hospitalized With Asthma,Oral Dexamethasone Versus Oral Prednisone in Children Hospitalized With Asthma: A Randomized Control Study,"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children. A short (3-5 day) course of a short-acting steroid such as Prednisone or Prednisolone has long been the standard of care for asthma exacerbation. Dexamethasone efficacy in asthma exacerbation has been studied in the outpatient setting and was found to be as effective as Prednisone. Dexamethasone has the advantage of shorter course, more compliance, and more tolerable. This has led many emergency departments to provide a 1-2 dose course of Dexamethasone on discharge. Thus, many inpatients have received a first dose of Dexamethasone prior to reaching the inpatient unit, leading to confusion about the best plan for these patients. Many hospitalist pediatricians continue to give a 5-day total course with Prednisone, but some patients have begun to receive a second dose of Dexamethasone 24 hours after the first dose. To our knowledge, no studies have been done to compare the efficacy of these two protocols in pediatric patients requiring hospitalization. The hypothesis is that a second dose of Dexamethasone is as effective as four additional days of Prednisone in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbation. This is an open label, randomized control study comparing these treatments in children age 2-18 hospitalized with asthma exacerbation who have received a first dose of Dexamethasone.","Corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for managing acute asthma exacerbations. Studies have shown that systemic steroids effect decrease relapse and hospital admission. Due to its short half-life, Prednisone is usually given daily or twice daily for 3-5 days. It has been associated with poor compliance due it the prolonged course. Dexamethasone half-life is 36 - 72 hours.

Several studies have shown no difference in outcomes between 3-5 days of prednisone and different forms of dexamethasone, including single intramuscular dose or single oral dose or two oral doses 1 day apart. However, those studies were done in the emergency department (ED). Lack of response to initial asthma treatment in ED results in admission to the hospital, implying more severe exacerbation than those able to be discharged. Some clinician shift to oral prednisone once admitted to the floor for patients who have received Dexamethasone or not. Others have begin to complete the Dexamethasone course with one more dose of Dexamethasone 24 hour after the first dose. Dexamethasone has the advantage of compliance and tolerability, however, no studies investigated its efficacy in hospitalized patients. Such knowledge will improve patient's compliance and outcomes.

* Sample size calculation: Primary outcome of return to normal activities within 3 days of discharge. Based on previous studies, it is estimated that 70% of the control group will achieve this goal. Based on a minimum absolute difference of 15%, and a power of 0.80, the sample size calculated to be 117 in each arm. Assuming 20% lost to follow up, it is intended to recruit 150 in each arm (total 300 subjects).
* Statistical Analysis: Demographics will be analyzed to ensure the experimental and control groups are equivalent at baseline. All proportions will be tested with Chi-square or Fisher exact test and two-sample T-test will be used for continuous variables. α = 0.05 will be used for all hypothesis tests. Interim analysis will be performed monthly and the study will be halted if any safety concerns arise. The Center for Health Equity and Quality Research (CHEQR) will help with statistical analysis

Based on previous studies, it is estimated that 70% of the control group will achieve this goal. Based on a minimum absolute difference of 15%, and a power of 0.80, the sample size calculated to be 117 in each arm. Assuming 20% lost to follow up, it is intended to recruit 150 in each arm (total 300 subjects). * Statistical Analysis: Demographics will be analyzed to ensure the experimental and control groups are equivalent at baseline. All proportions will be tested with Chi-square or Fisher exact test and two-sample T-test will be used for continuous variables. α = 0.05 will be used for all hypothesis tests. Interim analysis will be performed monthly and the study will be halted if any safety concerns arise. The Center for Health Equity and Quality Research (CHEQR) will help with statistical analysis * Data Safety and Monitoring Plan: The study PI and co-investigator will meet and review the collected data on a monthly basis and identify any interim results that may require a change of study protocol. Information that may affect subjects' safety will be communicated to appropriate parties in a timely fashion.

"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",OTHER,NCT03477279,Developing and Assessing a Male Engagement Intervention in Option B+ in Malawi,Developing and Assessing a Male Engagement Intervention in Option B+ in Malawi: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Lilongwe,"There is promising evidence that couple-based approaches within Malawi's Option B+ prevention of mother to child transmission program could address help address 1) poor male engagement in the HIV continuum of care, 2) low male adoption of biomedical HIV prevention approaches, 3) sub-optimal female engagement in the continuum of care, and 4) poor or uncertain infant outcomes. Our team has developed an intervention to address these challenges, and will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=500 couples) to assess intervention effectiveness at one year. Women with recent HIV infections enrolled in this trial will be compared against a cohort of 350 HIV-uninfected women to explore predictors of HIV acquisition in pregnancy in Malawi.","In sub-Saharan Africa, engaging HIV-infected men in HIV care and treatment and engaging HIV-uninfected men in prevention has proven challenging. Along all steps of the HIV care-seeking cascade, men exhibit worse care-seeking behaviors. They are less likely to seek HIV testing and counseling (HTC), initiate combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and be retained in cART care. Poor care-seeking has resulted in a lower prevalence of viral suppression and earlier mortality. Additionally, men rarely engage in the antenatal care-seeking of their female sexual partners, leading to worse maternal and infant outcomes. This low level of engagement has been noted in Malawi's Option B+ prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) program, and has been a critical barrier to female Option B+ uptake and retention, and a missed opportunity for engaging men.

There is promising evidence that couple-based approaches within Malawi's Option B+ prevention of mother to child transmission program could address all of these challenges: poor male engagement in the HIV continuum of care, low male adoption of biomedical HIV prevention approaches, sub-optimal female engagement in the continuum of care, and poor or uncertain infant outcomes. Our team has designed a couples-based intervention to address these challenges, and will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=500 couples) to assess intervention effectiveness at one year. Results from this study are expected to inform how best to address family outcomes in an Option B+ program.

This study has the following aims described below:

Aim 1: Determine whether the couple-based intervention increases new HIV-positive diagnoses among HIV-infected male sex partners, helps HIV-infected men engage and remain in care, and contributes to male viral suppression compared to individual standard of care. The investigators will compare the couple-based intervention to standard of care for increasing the proportion of men who are aware of being HIV-infected, the proportion of these men who initiate and remain in cART care, and the proportion of these men with viral suppression at one year.

Aim 2: Determine whether the couple-based intervention identifies HIV-discordant couples and decreases the likelihood of male exposure to HIV compared to individual standard of care. The investigators will compare the intervention to standard of care for increasing the number of men with non-HIV exposure from their female partner through consistent condom use, viral suppression, abstinence, or a combination of these methods over one year.

Aim 3: Determine whether the couple-based intervention improves female cART retention and viral suppression compared to individual standard of care. The investigators will compare the intervention to standard of care for female cART retention and viral suppression at one year.

Aim 4: Determine whether the couple-based intervention improves infant early infant diagnosis uptake compared to individual standard of care. Explore uptake of early infant diagnosis and rates of mother-to-child transmission and child survival in the two intervention arms.

Aim 5: Develop an in-depth understanding of HIV transmission dynamics in Lilongwe. Using the biomarkers and behavioral survey, we will seek to understand transmission timing, direction, and context in Lilongwe. We will compare women with recent HIV infection to a population of HIV-uninfected controls (n=350) to understand predictors of HIV acquisition in pregnancy in Malawi.","Inclusion Criteria (HIV-infected Women):

Baylor College of Medicine,OTHER,NCT04952584,Allogeneic CD30 Chimeric Antigen Receptor Epstein-Barr Virus-Specific T Lymphocytes in Relapsed or Refractory CD30-Positive Lymphomas,A Phase 1 Study Evaluating the Safety and Activity of Allogeneic CD30 Chimeric Antigen Receptor Epstein-Barr Virus-Specific T Lymphocytes (CD30.CAR-EBVSTs) in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD30-Positive Lymphomas,"This study involved patients that have a cancer called diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), NK and T cell lymphomas (NK/TL) or classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) (hereafter these 3 diseases will be referred to as lymphoma). Patients lymphoma has come back or not gone away after treatment. Because there is no standard treatment for the patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, the patients are being asked to volunteer in this research study.

In this study the investigators want to test a type of T cell made from a normal donor. The T cells the investigators will use are called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) specific T cells (EBVSTs) and are cells that the investigators have trained in the laboratory to recognize a EBV which is the virus that causes mono or kissing disease. Some patients with lymphoma have EBV in their cancer cells. Researchers have given T cell lines from normal donor EBVSTs to lymphoma patients who have EBV in their lymphoma cells and have seen responses in about half the patients. The cells have have been generated and are frozen in a bank. The cells are called ""allogeneic"" (meaning the donor is not related to the patient). CD30.CAR in EBV-specific T cells (called allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST) from the blood of healthy donors. The investigators are giving the cells to patients with lymphoma cells that express CD30. If the lymphoma cells also express EBV there may be some benefit from targeting both proteins.

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest safe dose of allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST cells given following chemotherapy and used to treat lymphoma. The investigators will learn the side effects of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in patients and see whether this therapy may help lymphoma patients.","Earlier, healthy donors gave blood for us to make CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in the laboratory. These cells were grown and frozen and the investigators will select the donor which the investigators think is the best match for the patient. This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Once the lower dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the T cell infusion will be stopped. Both the risks and benefits of this study may be dose related. The investigators don't know the best dose that will provide benefit while minimizing the risks.

To enroll on this study, patients will need to have recovered from toxic effects of previous chemotherapy and not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients cannot have received any tumor vaccines within the previous six weeks.

If patients agree to take part in this study, the investigators will ask the patients to adhere to the following study visits and procedure. After patients have signed the consent form, patients are required to come to the hospital for a series of standard medical screening tests, lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, infusion with CD30.CAR-EBVST cell treatment and follow-up visits (See details below).

1. Screening tests

   Screening tests include:
   * Blood tests \[Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) testing\] to help us identify the best match for the patient from the banked CD30.CAR-EBVST cells.
   * Blood tests for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus \[HIV\], human T cell lymphotropic virus \[HTLV\], hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus.
   * Tumor biopsy test to check the status of CD30.

   Once the investigators find that patients are eligible for this study, patients will be called for additional screening tests before treatment day. The screening tests include:
   * Physical examination
   * Vital signs tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure
   * Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions
   * Urine test
   * Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential
   * Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies
2. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in the blood stream. Because of that, if patients have NOT had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant recently, patients will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy drugs) before patients receive the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells if patients doctor thinks this is appropriate. This is called ""lymphodepletion"". These drugs will decrease the numbers of patients own T cells before the investigators inject the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Although the investigators do not expect any effect on the patients tumor with the dose that the patients will receive, these drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat lymphoma.
3. Treatment with CD30.CAR-EBVST cells Patients will be given one injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. The CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will be injected into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. Before patients receive the injection, patients may be given a dose of acetaminophen or anti-histamine (Benadryl for example) to minimize any possible allergic reaction. The injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will take within 10 minutes. The investigators will follow patients in the clinic after each injection for up to 3 hours. The patient will need to stay less than 2 hours away from the Medical Center for 4 weeks after the CD30.CAR-EBVST cell infusion so the investigator can monitor them for side effects.

   At the discretion of the study doctor, if patients have stable disease (the lymphoma did not grow) or there is a reduction in the size of the patients lymphoma on imaging studies at week 6 after T-cell infusion or on subsequent evaluations, then patients may receive up to two additional doses of the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells at approximately 6 weeks intervals if patients wish to. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy may also be administered before additional doses of CD30.CAR-EBVST infusion. After each T-cell infusion, patients will be monitored to ensure that participants don't have a reaction to the infusion.
4. Follow-up visits

On follow-up visits after treatment, patients will also receive a series of standard medical tests:

* Physical examination
* Vital sign tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure
* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions
* Urine tests (if clinically necessary)
* Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (if clinically necessary)
* Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies

After infusion of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells,the patients blood will be collected on follow-up visits at week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 8, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 more years. Blood samples and tumor biopsies will also be periodically collected, based on the patients doctor's discretion for exploratory tests in the laboratory. After 5 years, in the event there is suspected or new cancer is detected, additional blood sample will also be collected for additional tests.

To learn more about the way the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells are working and how long they last in the body, the investigators will draw blood. The total amount of blood collected on any day is about 4-18 teaspoons (18-87 ml). This volume is considered safe but may be decreased if the patients are anemic. Patients blood will be drawn from a central line if participants have one. The total blood drawn during the patients participation in this study will not exceed 110 teaspoons (546 ml).

The investigators will also look at any scans or biopsies patients have had as standard of care.","Inclusion Criteria:

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest safe dose of allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST cells given following chemotherapy and used to treat lymphoma. The investigators will learn the side effects of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in patients and see whether this therapy may help lymphoma patients. Earlier, healthy donors gave blood for us to make CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in the laboratory. These cells were grown and frozen and the investigators will select the donor which the investigators think is the best match for the patient. This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Once the lower dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the T cell infusion will be stopped. Both the risks and benefits of this study may be dose related. The investigators don't know the best dose that will provide benefit while minimizing the risks. To enroll on this study, patients will need to have recovered from toxic effects of previous chemotherapy and not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients cannot have received any tumor vaccines within the previous six weeks. If patients agree to take part in this study, the investigators will ask the patients to adhere to the following study visits and procedure. After patients have signed the consent form, patients are required to come to the hospital for a series of standard medical screening tests, lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, infusion with CD30.CAR-EBVST cell treatment and follow-up visits (See details below). 1. Screening tests Screening tests include: * Blood tests \[Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) testing\] to help us identify the best match for the patient from the banked CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. * Blood tests for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus \[HIV\], human T cell lymphotropic virus \[HTLV\], hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. * Tumor biopsy test to check the status of CD30. Once the investigators find that patients are eligible for this study, patients will be called for additional screening tests before treatment day. The screening tests include: * Physical examination * Vital signs tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure * Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions * Urine test * Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential * Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies 2. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in the blood stream. Because of that, if patients have NOT had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant recently, patients will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy drugs) before patients receive the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells if patients doctor thinks this is appropriate. This is called ""lymphodepletion"". These drugs will decrease the numbers of patients own T cells before the investigators inject the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Although the investigators do not expect any effect on the patients tumor with the dose that the patients will receive, these drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat lymphoma. 3. Treatment with CD30.CAR-EBVST cells Patients will be given one injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. The CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will be injected into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. Before patients receive the injection, patients may be given a dose of acetaminophen or anti-histamine (Benadryl for example) to minimize any possible allergic reaction. The injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will take within 10 minutes. The investigators will follow patients in the clinic after each injection for up to 3 hours. The patient will need to stay less than 2 hours away from the Medical Center for 4 weeks after the CD30.CAR-EBVST cell infusion so the investigator can monitor them for side effects. At the discretion of the study doctor, if patients have stable disease (the lymphoma did not grow) or there is a reduction in the size of the patients lymphoma on imaging studies at week 6 after T-cell infusion or on subsequent evaluations, then patients may receive up to two additional doses of the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells at approximately 6 weeks intervals if patients wish to. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy may also be administered before additional doses of CD30.CAR-EBVST infusion. After each T-cell infusion, patients will be monitored to ensure that participants don't have a reaction to the infusion. 4. Follow-up visits On follow-up visits after treatment, patients will also receive a series of standard medical tests: * Physical examination * Vital sign tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure * Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions * Urine tests (if clinically necessary) * Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (if clinically necessary) * Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies After infusion of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells,the patients blood will be collected on follow-up visits at week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 8, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 more years. Blood samples and tumor biopsies will also be periodically collected, based on the patients doctor's discretion for exploratory tests in the laboratory. After 5 years, in the event there is suspected or new cancer is detected, additional blood sample will also be collected for additional tests. To learn more about the way the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells are working and how long they last in the body, the investigators will draw blood. The total amount of blood collected on any day is about 4-18 teaspoons (18-87 ml). This volume is considered safe but may be decreased if the patients are anemic. Patients blood will be drawn from a central line if participants have one. The total blood drawn during the patients participation in this study will not exceed 110 teaspoons (546 ml). The investigators will also look at any scans or biopsies patients have had as standard of care. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Diagnosis and clinical course falling into one of the following categories: 1.

Robotic hysterectomy is when a patient is electively having robotic assisted removal of one's uterus. Both medications liposomal bupivacaine and Bupivacaine are standard of care in these types of surgeries.,"Treatment technique:

The patient will be in the supine position. The transversus abdominis muscle layer will be identified with the ultrasound. Using sterile technique, skin infiltration with 2% lidocaine will occur, 2 cm medial to the ultrasound probe. An 22g Nerve block needle will then be inserted and advanced under ultrasound guidance until it is below the fascial covering of the transversus abdominis muscle layer. Gentle aspiration for air, or blood will be performed and either 30 cc of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1/200,000 parts epinephrine or 30 mL of liposomal bupivacaine mixed 1:1 with normal saline will be injected under ultrasound guidance. For each 5cc of local anesthetic injected, aspiration will be performed. Upon completion of the injection, the needle will then be removed. This will then be completed on the contralateral side. The patient will be monitored in the preoperative area until he/she is brought into the operating room for their procedure.

When the operation is complete the patient will either be discharged home or brought to the ward where each day a member of the research team will evaluate the patient for signs of complications and ask the patient their minimum and maximum pain score.

If patients have met criterion for discharge to home including pain \<4/10, independence of intravenous analgesia, and are stable for discharge medically, but are awaiting placement, the time of discharge for the purposes of the study will be the day they have met such criterion as opposed to the day of actual discharge, as this can vary depending on patient placement.

If the patient is discharged prior to 72 hours post injection, then the patient will receive one phone call at 24 hours post injection, 48 hours post injection , and 72 hours post injection +/- 5 hours. During this phone call the patient will be asked about pain score, narcotic use, overall satisfaction via a recorded patient questionnaire, quality of recovery via a quality of recovery survey, and assessed if any adverse events have occurred.

Adequate analgesia will be defined as \<3 VAS at rest, and if VAS is greater than 3 adjustments in oral or intravenous pain medications will be given as determined by the nurse.","Inclusion Criteria:

Both medications liposomal bupivacaine and Bupivacaine are standard of care in these types of surgeries. Treatment technique: The patient will be in the supine position. The transversus abdominis muscle layer will be identified with the ultrasound. Using sterile technique, skin infiltration with 2% lidocaine will occur, 2 cm medial to the ultrasound probe. An 22g Nerve block needle will then be inserted and advanced under ultrasound guidance until it is below the fascial covering of the transversus abdominis muscle layer. Gentle aspiration for air, or blood will be performed and either 30 cc of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1/200,000 parts epinephrine or 30 mL of liposomal bupivacaine mixed 1:1 with normal saline will be injected under ultrasound guidance. For each 5cc of local anesthetic injected, aspiration will be performed. Upon completion of the injection, the needle will then be removed. This will then be completed on the contralateral side. The patient will be monitored in the preoperative area until he/she is brought into the operating room for their procedure. When the operation is complete the patient will either be discharged home or brought to the ward where each day a member of the research team will evaluate the patient for signs of complications and ask the patient their minimum and maximum pain score. If patients have met criterion for discharge to home including pain \<4/10, independence of intravenous analgesia, and are stable for discharge medically, but are awaiting placement, the time of discharge for the purposes of the study will be the day they have met such criterion as opposed to the day of actual discharge, as this can vary depending on patient placement. If the patient is discharged prior to 72 hours post injection, then the patient will receive one phone call at 24 hours post injection, 48 hours post injection , and 72 hours post injection +/- 5 hours. During this phone call the patient will be asked about pain score, narcotic use, overall satisfaction via a recorded patient questionnaire, quality of recovery via a quality of recovery survey, and assessed if any adverse events have occurred. Adequate analgesia will be defined as \<3 VAS at rest, and if VAS is greater than 3 adjustments in oral or intravenous pain medications will be given as determined by the nurse. Inclusion Criteria: * those who present for elective robotic assisted hysterectomy Exclusion Criteria: * non english speaking * chronic pain * on opioids greater than 1 weeks * chronic anticoagulation * allergy to local anesthetics * use of spinal or epidural for surgery * lack of patient cooperation * contraindication to regional anesthesia"

An endoscopic pancreatic function test (ePFT) with secretin will be performed in children undergoing routine investigative EGD.

The goal of this study is to identify the role of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in patients with abdominal pain who are undergoing upper endoscopy, who otherwise would be labelled as recurrent abdominal pain (RAP).","Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is an often encountered complaint in children and adolescents. The evaluation of the child or adolescent with recurrent abdominal pain requires an understanding of the pathogenesis of abdominal pain, the most common causes of abdominal pain, and the typical patterns of presentation.

Children and adolescents frequently undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate complaint and recurrent abdominal pain is a frequently cited reason for endoscopy. This is a standard procedure where an endoscope is passed through the mouth, esophagus, stomach and into the first part of the small intestine. With the camera at the end of the endoscope, the endoscopist is able to see the gross appearance of the upper digestive tract. Small biopsy samples are collected from the small intestine, stomach and esophagus to evaluate for mucosal injury, irritation, infection or other anomalies that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This is helpful for evaluation of histological changes, but does not provide information about its function.

Pancreatic stimulation testing with secretagogue (secretin, cholecystokinin) administration, and direct pancreatic fluid collection is considered a gold standard to assess the exocrine pancreatic function. Indirect testing of pancreatic function such as with urine or stool has much lower sensitivity and specificity compared to direct pancreatic fluid collection.

This is a prospective study where patients undergoing investigative EGD will have endoscopic pancreatic function test (ePFT) with secretin.

There will be two groups:

The first group are patients that are undergoing EGD with ePFT for evaluation of suspected or established pancreatic insufficiency with symptoms such as failure to thrive or malabsorption. These patients are the ones that historically have had ePFT testing done to evaluate their pancreatic function.

The second group is all patients that are undergoing scheduled diagnostic EGD for other reasons that consent for pancreatic stimulation testing. These patients are usually undergoing EGD for a range of symptoms that frequently include recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, nausea and/or constipation. These patients do not typically have ePFT testing performed and is not usually thought to be part of the standard of care for this group.","Inclusion Criteria:

Georgetown University,OTHER,NCT03885284,Study of Proton Therapy in Adjuvant Pancreatic Cancer,Phase I Study of Proton Therapy in Adjuvant Pancreatic Cancer (Proton-PANC),This trial aims to determine a safe schedule of short-course proton beam radiation therapy with adjuvant mFOLFIRINOX for patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,"The investigators hypothesize that resected pancreatic cancer patients will benefit from enhanced local control with the addition of radiation therapy to adjuvant FFX. The recently reported PRODIGE 24 study, demonstrated that 12 cycles of adjuvant FFX without radiation therapy significantly improved survival and time to metastatic failure rates as compared to GEM alone. Excessive distant failures rates using prior adjuvant systemic therapies, may have limited the impact of radiation therapy; therefore, improvements in systemic control can increase the benefit of local control.

In this study, the investigators utilize 5 fraction PRT, delivered over 1 week, during adjuvant FFX (between cycles 6 and 7) to minimize the interruptions in chemotherapy as well as to reduce the length of time from surgical resection to initiating adjuvant radiation therapy. Conventional radiation therapy is typically delivered over 5 weeks and is commonly given after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Conventional radiation therapy cannot be given concurrently with FFX due to the synergistic toxicities. In contrast, PRT significantly reduces the exposure of normal tissues to the effects of radiation therapy and has been safely delivered using a 5 fraction schedule with chemotherapy, as previously discussed.

Chemotherapy will consist of mFOLFIRINOX in 14-day cycles x 12 as used in the PRODIGE 24 study:

The specific autoantibody against aquaporin 4 (AQP4-ab) has been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Peripheral blood plasma cells are a major source of AQP4-ab. Previous studies have observed increased IL-6 levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with NMOSD, particularly during relapses. Exogenous interleukin (IL)-6 promotes the survival of plasma cells and their production of AQP4-ab in vitro.

Tocilizumab (ACTEMRA®), a humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor, has shown beneficial clinical effects in some patients with NMOSD when concomitant immunosuppressive medications were administered. However, the long-lasting biological effects of preceding immunotherapies such as rituximab might overlap with the subsequent tocilizumab therapy. To reduce the side effects of concomitant treatments to large extent and verify the beneficial effects of tocilizumab, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab as monotherapy in patients with NMOSD.","The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug tocilizumab as monotherapy contributes to reduce the average relapsing rate (ARR) and improve neurological disability in NMOSD patients, who still have experienced relapses when common immunosuppressive medications including rituximab had been used.

Traditional oxygen delivery methods, such as the simple nasal cannula, are commonly used to prevent hypoxia in these cases. The high-flow nasal cannula, capable of delivering FiO2 levels of up to 1 and flow rates of up to 70 l/min, offers additional benefits, including positive end-expiratory pressure and reduced dead space. We hypothesized is that the use of high-flow nasal cannula can decrease the incidence of hypoxia in comparison to simple nasal cannula in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures under deep sedation.

This was prospective, comparative observational study conducted in a tertiary care center of Nepal with the primary objective to compare the rates of hypoxia (SpO2 \< 92%) and secondary objectives were to compare interruption of procedure due to hypoxia, minimum hypoxia level and episodes of hypoxia between high flow nasal canula (flow rate of 30l/min with FiO2 of 0.5) and simple nasal canula (flow rate of 6l/min) in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures in semi-prone position in deep sedation using propofol infusion.

The study comprised 125 participants, 58 in simple nasal canula and 67 in high flow nasal cannula group. The incidence of hypoxia in simple nasal cannula and high flow nasal cannula groups, with rates of 37.3% (22/58) and 16.4% (11/67), respectively. The relative risk (RR) of hypoxia was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.23-0.81), with a p-value of 0.009. Procedural interruptions due to hypoxia occurred in 8.6% (5/58) of participants in the simple nasal cannula group and 4.47% (3/67) in the high flow nasal cannula group, with RR of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.02-1.41) and a p-value 0.1. Furthermore, the occurrence of multiple episodes of hypoxia was higher in the simple nasal cannula group compared to the high flow nasal cannula group (5 vs. 0), with a p-value \< 0.001.The use of high flow nasal cannula reduces the occurrence of hypoxia in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures with deep sedation compared to simple nasal cannula.","This study was prospective, comparative, open-label and observational study conducted on tertiary hospital of Nepal between July 2023-April 2024.A written informed consent was taken from all the patients before enrolling to study. Patient aged more than 16 years, ASA-PS grading I-IV, both the gender, both elective procedures undergoing complex UGI endoscopic procedure in deep sedation under propofol infusion were included. Patient not willing to enrolled, pre-operative SPO2 \< 92% and pre-operative MAP \< 60 mm Hg were excluded from study. Sixty-two patients were enrolled in each group so total sample size was 124 using following sample size formula. .

After arriving in the procedure room, standard monitoring, including pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, and electrocardiography were attached. An anesthesiologist assigned made the decision on which oxygenation device to use for the patient. In SNC group, an oxygen flow rate of 6 l/min where in HFNC group at the beginning of procedure flow was set 10 l/min once patient was induced flow rate increased to 30 l/min with FiO2 of 0.5. The patients were positioned either laterally or semiprone. Prior to the start of the procedure, the patient was given an injection of fentanyl 1mcg/kg. An initial dose of propofol was administered at a rate of 1-1.5 mg/kg by slow titrating manner. The sedation level, ventilatory pattern,rate and depth were clinically monitored throughout the procedure.The propofol infusion was kept between 25-150 mcg/kg/min, aiming for preventing facial grimace, agitation, or gag reflex, while still allowing the patient to respond to painful stimuli. In case of any sings of agitation noticed, the anaesthesiologist added the additional dose of propofol or increase the propofol infusion rate or both, as in our usual practice.

In SNC group, if SpO2 decreased below 92%, flow rate increased to 8 l/min whereas in HFNC group FiO2 increased to 1 and flow rate increased to 50 l/min. If desaturation continued despite of above mentioned measure in both groups, anesthesiologist increased the FiO2, flow or both. Bag mask ventilation and tracheal intubation was done if needed. Other events; bradycardia needing atropine, hypotension needing vasopressor, persistent hypoxia needing bag and mask, endotracheal intubation was recorded.

Hypoxia is defined as a decrease in oxygen saturation \< 92%. Severe hypoxia is defined as a decrease in oxygen saturation \< 80%.

There are multiple factors contributing to clopidogrel response variability, including genetic variations of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme. In particular, loss-of-function (LOF) alleles of the CYP2C19 enzyme reduce transformation of clopidogrel pro-drug into its active metabolite. Thus, patients carrying LOF alleles have lower levels of clopidogrel's active metabolite as well as diminished platelet inhibition, which translates into an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Prasugrel and ticagrelor are novel generation P2Y12 receptor inhibitors characterized by greater PD potency and reduced ischemic event rates compared with clopidogrel, and are not affected by CYP2C19 LOF polymorphisms. However, to date there are limited head-to-head PD comparisons between these two new P2Y12 receptors blockers, and there are no studies assessing on how these agents behave among CYP2C19 LOF carriers. The aim of the present study is to compare the PD effects of prasugrel versus ticagrelor in patients undergoing PCI with CYP2C19 LOF alleles using the novel point-of-care genetic testing Spartan RX-CYP2C19 which permits accurate and rapid identification of CYP2C19 genetic status.","Clopidogrel is the most broadly utilized platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor.

There are multiple factors contributing to clopidogrel response variability, including genetic variations of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme. In particular, loss-of-function (LOF) alleles of the CYP2C19 enzyme reduce transformation of clopidogrel pro-drug into its active metabolite. Thus, patients carrying LOF alleles have lower levels of clopidogrel's active metabolite as well as diminished platelet inhibition, which translates into an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Prasugrel and ticagrelor are novel generation P2Y12 receptor inhibitors characterized by greater PD potency and reduced ischemic event rates compared with clopidogrel, and are not affected by CYP2C19 LOF polymorphisms. However, to date there are limited head-to-head PD comparisons between these two new P2Y12 receptors blockers, and there are no studies assessing on how these agents behave among CYP2C19 LOF carriers. The aim of the present study is to compare the PD effects of prasugrel versus ticagrelor in patients undergoing PCI with CYP2C19 LOF alleles using the novel point-of-care genetic testing Spartan RX-CYP2C19 which permits accurate and rapid identification of CYP2C19 genetic status. Clopidogrel is the most broadly utilized platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. However, numerous studies have shown that pharmacodynamics (PD) response profiles vary among clopidogrel treated patients and that individuals with reduced response have an increased risk of recurrent ischemic events. There are multiple factors contributing to clopidogrel response variability. Among these, genetic variations of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme, a key contributor to clopidogrel metabolism, have been involved. In particular, loss-of-function (LOF) alleles of the CYP2C19 enzyme reduce transformation of clopidogrel pro-drug into its active metabolite. Thus, patients carrying LOF alleles have lower levels of clopidogrel's active metabolite as well as diminished platelet inhibition, which translates into an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Because of these findings, drug regulating authorities have provided a boxed warning on the product label of clopidogrel on the potential for reduced efficacy of clopidogrel among CYP2C19 LOF carriers and suggested considering alternative antiplatelet therapies for these individuals. Prasugrel and ticagrelor are novel generation P2Y12 receptor inhibitors characterized by greater PD potency and reduced ischemic event rates compared with clopidogrel, and are not affected by CYP2C19 LOF polymorphisms. However, to date there are limited head-to-head PD comparisons between these two new P2Y12 receptors blockers, and there are no studies assessing on how these agents behave among CYP2C19 LOF carriers. Tailoring antiplatelet therapy according to results of genetic testing has been limited in real world clinical practice because of not having readily accessible results of individual's genetic makeup. The aim of the present study is to compare the PD effects of prasugrel versus ticagrelor in patients undergoing PCI with CYP2C19 LOF alleles using the novel point-of-care genetic testing Spartan RX-CYP2C19 which permits accurate and rapid identification of CYP2C19 genetic status. * Inclusion criteria: 1.

University of Minnesota,OTHER,NCT00218179,Assessing the Link Between Smoke Carcinogen Biomarkers and Lung Cancer Risk - 1,"Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screen Trial",Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Currently it remains impossible to predict which smokers will get cancer. Each puff of a cigarette delivers a mixture of over 60 known carcinogens. Biomarkers that quantify carcinogen levels and metabolism are a useful tool and available to use. The purpose of this study is to assess the link between tobacco smoke carcinogen biomarkers and the risk of developing lung cancer.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Approximately 90% of lung cancer is caused by cigarette smoking. While most lung cancer cases occur in smokers or ex-smokers, only 15-25% of smokers will get lung cancer. Currently it remains impossible to predict which smokers will get cancer.

Each puff of a cigarette delivers, along with nicotine, a mixture of over 60 known carcinogens. Most of these carcinogens require metabolic activation before they can negatively affect cell DNA and cause cancer. Biomarkers that quantify carcinogen levels and metabolic activity of carcinogens are a useful tool and available to use. The purpose of this study is to assess the link between tobacco smoke carcinogen biomarkers and the risk of developing lung cancer.

This observational case-control study will involve a random selection from a group of smokers who are participating in the Prostrate, Lung, Colon, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screen Trial. The chosen cases will include 300 incident lung cancer cases and 300 controls (participants who have had no diagnosis of lung cancer). Demographic and baseline data from the PLCO database will be obtained. Prior baseline blood samples from the PLCO trial will be obtained as well. Based on age, sex, and smoking history, participants will be grouped into triplets in order to pool their blood samples. These samples will then be analyzed to determine whether distributions of biomarker levels in lung cancer participants differ from those in non-lung cancer participants. This study will not involve recruitment of any participants, as data and samples from the PLCO trial will be used and no new blood samples will be obtained.","Inclusion Criteria:

Currently it remains impossible to predict which smokers will get cancer. Each puff of a cigarette delivers a mixture of over 60 known carcinogens. Biomarkers that quantify carcinogen levels and metabolism are a useful tool and available to use. The purpose of this study is to assess the link between tobacco smoke carcinogen biomarkers and the risk of developing lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Approximately 90% of lung cancer is caused by cigarette smoking. While most lung cancer cases occur in smokers or ex-smokers, only 15-25% of smokers will get lung cancer. Currently it remains impossible to predict which smokers will get cancer. Each puff of a cigarette delivers, along with nicotine, a mixture of over 60 known carcinogens. Most of these carcinogens require metabolic activation before they can negatively affect cell DNA and cause cancer. Biomarkers that quantify carcinogen levels and metabolic activity of carcinogens are a useful tool and available to use. The purpose of this study is to assess the link between tobacco smoke carcinogen biomarkers and the risk of developing lung cancer. This observational case-control study will involve a random selection from a group of smokers who are participating in the Prostrate, Lung, Colon, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screen Trial. The chosen cases will include 300 incident lung cancer cases and 300 controls (participants who have had no diagnosis of lung cancer). Demographic and baseline data from the PLCO database will be obtained. Prior baseline blood samples from the PLCO trial will be obtained as well. Based on age, sex, and smoking history, participants will be grouped into triplets in order to pool their blood samples. These samples will then be analyzed to determine whether distributions of biomarker levels in lung cancer participants differ from those in non-lung cancer participants. This study will not involve recruitment of any participants, as data and samples from the PLCO trial will be used and no new blood samples will be obtained.

Catherine Bollard,OTHER,NCT01956084,Cytotoxic T Cells to Treat Relapsed EBV-positive Lymphoma,ADMINISTRATION of LMP-SPECIFIC CYTOTOXIC T-LYMPHOCYTES to PATIENTS with RELAPSED EBV-POSITIVE LYMPHOMA,"In this study, investigators are trying to see if LMP specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) will prevent or treat disease called Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) Disorder including either Hodgkin Lymphoma or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Lymphoepithelioma or severe chronic active EBV infection syndrome (SCAEBV) or Leiomyosarcoma which has come back or has not gone away after treatment, including the best treatment. Investigators are using special immune system cells called third party LMP specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a new experimental therapy.

Some patients with Lymphoma or SCAEBV or Leiomyosarcoma show evidence of infection with the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at the time of their diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, suggesting that it may play a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells (in lymphoma) and some B cells (in SCAEBV) infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction. The investigators want to see if special white blood cells, called T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in patient's blood and affect the tumor or infection.

Investigators used this sort of therapy to treat a different type of cancer that occurs after bone marrow or solid organ transplant called post transplant lymphoma. In this type of cancer the tumor cells have 9 proteins made by EBV on their surface. They grew T cells in the laboratory that recognized all 9 proteins and were able to successfully prevent and treat post transplant lymphoma. However in Hodgkin Lymphoma, the tumor cells and B cells only express 2 EBV proteins. In a previous study they made T cells that recognized all 9 proteins and gave them to patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma. Some patients had a partial response to this therapy but no patients had a complete response. They think one reason may be that many of the T cells reacted with proteins that were not on the tumor cells. In this present study the investigators are trying to find out if the investigators can improve this treatment by growing T cells that recognize proteins expressed on EBV infected Lymphoma cells and B cells called LMP-1 and LMP2. These special T cells are called third party LMP 1/2 -specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). These LMP-specific cytotoxic

T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.","Investigators will first test a biopsy of the tumor or lymph node that has already been done to see if the tumor or tissue cells are EBV positive. If the patient is eligible, investigators will then take 60 mL (about 12 teaspoons) of blood from the patient or their donor on one or two occasions. They will use this blood to grow T cells. First they will grow a special type of cells called dendritic cells or monocytes which will stimulate the T cells. Next they will put a specially produced human virus that carries the LMP genes into the dendritic cells or monocytes. They will then be used to stimulate T cells. This stimulation will train the T cells to kill cells with LMP on their surface. Investigators will then grow these LMP specific CTLs by more stimulation with EBV infected cells. These EBV infected cells will be treated with radiation so they cannot grow.

Once sufficient numbers of T cells have been made, investigators will test them to make sure they kill cells with LMP on their surface. If the counts are low they may need to obtain additional blood samples to make these cells. Prior to giving the patient the CTLs, the cells will be tested to make sure they don't attack the tissue.

The cells will then be thawed and injected into the patient over 10 minutes. Initially, two doses of T cells will be given two weeks apart. If after the second infusion there is a reduction in the size of the lymphoma on CT or MRI scan as assessed by a radiologist, the patient can receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if the patient wishes. This is a dose escalation study which means that for some patients the second dose may be larger than the first. All of the treatments will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or the Methodist Hospital.

For follow-up after the CTL infusions, the patient will be seen every 3 months for the first year. Then the patient will either be seen in the clinic or they will be contacted by a research nurse yearly for 5 years.","Inclusion Criteria:

"University of Massachusetts, Worcester",OTHER,NCT02200484,"Project HERA (Health, Education, and Relationship-building for Adolescents- Moms and Tots)",Helping Ethnically Diverse Teen Moms Prevent Obesity in Their Preschool Children,"Specific Aims:

1. The primary aims of this study are to conduct formative interviews with teen mothers to inform a targeted adaptation of empirically based weight management and parent training programs for teen mothers for their preschoolers.
2. To conduct a small pilot and post-pilot focus group of the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment and retention methods \& the intervention.

Study Hypotheses:

Given the small sample size and fact that this is a pilot study, focus will be on estimating effect sizes rather than statistical hypothesis testing. However, the investigators exploratory hypotheses are as follows:

1. (a) The adapted intervention will be more feasible compared to the wellness control condition, with a participant retention rate of ≥80% and an average adherence (attendance at weekly treatment sessions; homework completion 5 weekdays weekly) is ≥ 75%; (b) The adapted intervention will be more acceptable compared to the wellness control condition, based on the Consumer Satisfaction Scale and Therapy Assessment Inventory with ≥90% of the participants responding to the item, ""In general how satisfied were you with the intervention?"" by choosing ""unsatisfied"" to ""very satisfied.""
2. (a) The adapted intervention will result in greater improvements in child behavior and parent-child connectedness compared to the control condition; (b) the adapted intervention versus wellness control condition will result in greater increases in child and teen mother individual as well as joint physical activity and physically active play and greater reductions in individual and joint teen mother and child sedentary behavior (television viewing) from baseline to post-intervention; (c) the greater teen mother and child fruit and vegetable consumption; and reduced child juice and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption from baseline to post-intervention; (d) the adapted intervention versus wellness control condition will result in smaller increases in child BMI percentile and teen mother BMI from baseline to post-intervention; (e) participants who attend higher numbers of intervention sessions will show greater improvements in target outcomes (child behavior, parent-child connectedness, and teen mother and child physical activity, sedentary behavior and BMI); with participants receiving the adapted intervention versus wellness control showing the greatest dose-based improvements.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

The primary aims of this study are to conduct formative interviews with teen mothers to inform a targeted adaptation of empirically based weight management and parent training programs for teen mothers for their preschoolers. 2. To conduct a small pilot and post-pilot focus group of the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment and retention methods \& the intervention. Study Hypotheses: Given the small sample size and fact that this is a pilot study, focus will be on estimating effect sizes rather than statistical hypothesis testing. However, the investigators exploratory hypotheses are as follows: 1. (a) The adapted intervention will be more feasible compared to the wellness control condition, with a participant retention rate of ≥80% and an average adherence (attendance at weekly treatment sessions; homework completion 5 weekdays weekly) is ≥ 75%; (b) The adapted intervention will be more acceptable compared to the wellness control condition, based on the Consumer Satisfaction Scale and Therapy Assessment Inventory with ≥90% of the participants responding to the item, ""In general how satisfied were you with the intervention?"" by choosing ""unsatisfied"" to ""very satisfied."" 2. (a) The adapted intervention will result in greater improvements in child behavior and parent-child connectedness compared to the control condition; (b) the adapted intervention versus wellness control condition will result in greater increases in child and teen mother individual as well as joint physical activity and physically active play and greater reductions in individual and joint teen mother and child sedentary behavior (television viewing) from baseline to post-intervention; (c) the greater teen mother and child fruit and vegetable consumption; and reduced child juice and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption from baseline to post-intervention; (d) the adapted intervention versus wellness control condition will result in smaller increases in child BMI percentile and teen mother BMI from baseline to post-intervention; (e) participants who attend higher numbers of intervention sessions will show greater improvements in target outcomes (child behavior, parent-child connectedness, and teen mother and child physical activity, sedentary behavior and BMI); with participants receiving the adapted intervention versus wellness control showing the greatest dose-based improvements.

The investigators hypothesize that patients treated with ribociclib who are CYP3A5 poor metabolizers may be exposed to higher levels of ribociclib than CYP3A5 intermediate or normal metabolizers. The findings could allow clinicians to tailor treatments to maintain therapeutic doses while limiting toxicities.,"This prospective, multicenter, cohort study will assess ribociclib (600 mg PO daily) pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics in female patients with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. This design will be used for two independent, race-based cohorts: 18 African American/Black patients and 18 Non-Hispanic White patients. Women are eligible if they are older than 18, have HR+/HER2- mBC and are candidates for treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. Patients are ineligible if currently prescribed a medication that inhibits or induces the CYP3A isoenzymes, have baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities, or are otherwise considered to be ineligible for ribociclib.

Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 and high dose cytarabine in treating patients with refractory or relapsed acute myelocytic or acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia or refractory or relapsed lymphoblastic lymphoma.","OBJECTIVES: I. Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bryostatin 1 administered before and after high dose cytarabine in patients with refractory or relapsed acute myelocytic leukemia or acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or refractory or relapsed lymphoblastic lymphoma. II. Describe the toxic effects of bryostatin 1 and high dose cytarabine in these patients. III.

Correlate bryostatin 1 induced modulation of leukemic cell PKC activity or leukemic cell maturation with high dose cytarabine mediated apoptosis.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive bryostatin 1 by continuous infusion over 24 hours on day 1. One hour after completion of bryostatin 1, patients receive high dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 2-4. Patients again receive cytarabine over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 9-11, followed 1 hour later by bryostatin 1 by continuous infusion over 24 hours beginning on day 11.

Consolidation chemotherapy is the same as induction chemotherapy except patients receive only 2 doses of cytarabine after day 1 completion of bryostatin and only 2 doses of cytarabine prior to the day 11 dose of bryostatin. Patients achieving partial remission may receive a second course of induction chemotherapy. In the absence of dose limiting toxicity in the first 3 patients treated, subsequent cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin 1 on the same schedule.

Yale University,OTHER,NCT02848079,TAS-OX for Refractory Metastatic Colon Cancer,TAS-102 and Oxaliplatin (TAS-OX) for Refractory Metastatic Colon Cancer,This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of oxaliplatin in combination with TAS-102 (TAS-OX) for treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose cancer has progressed or recurred after FOLFOX chemotherapy.,"TAS-102 is an oral agent, which consists of a combination of a novel antimetabolite 5-trifluorothymidine (FTD) and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) that prevents degradation of FTD. It has demonstrated activity in chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. In the Japanese randomized phase II trial, TAS-102 improved medial overall survival when compared to placebo (9.0 vs.6.6 months, Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.56) in patients with mCRC refractory to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Subsequently, a randomized phase III study conducted in 13 countries (RECOURSE trial) confirmed this benefit on overall survival when compared to placebo (7.1 months vs. 5.3 months, HR 0.68) in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) 5.

Oxaliplatin is a third generation platinum compound, which is active when used together with 5-FU in the treatment of mCRC (FOLFOX). FOLFOX chemotherapy, which is frequently combined with anti-angiogenic agent Bevacizumab, is widely accepted as the preferred first-line regimen in the treatment of this disease in the US. Oxaliplatin is also frequently reintroduced in more advanced settings. Reintroduction is seen after progression on maintenance therapy, after resolution of previous treatment limiting neuropathy, after disease recurrence post adjuvant treatment or post metastasectomy. In the control arm of a randomized study of FOLFOX4 or FOLFOX7 with oxaliplatin in a stop-and-go fashion in advanced colorectal cancer (OPTIMOX1 study), oxaliplatin was reintroduced in 27% of patients. Although patients derive clinical benefit when oxaliplatin is reintroduced, the response rates are not as robust as during initial exposures. Decreased efficacy may be at least in part due to prolonged exposure and resultant resistance to 5-FU, which is a backbone in maintenance and in oxaliplatin containing regimens. Hence, the investigators propose exploring the safety and efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with an alternative anti-metabolite TAS-102 (TAS-OX).

TAS-102 has demonstrated activity in 5-FU refractory mCRC, so the investigators hypothesize that TAS-OX may serve as an alternative drug combination for patients who have progressed or recurred after FOLFOX, and who are candidates for additional oxaliplatin therapy.

This is a 2-part clinical trial with TAS-102 in combination with oxaliplatin. The first part will be a dose-finding run-in phase and will enroll 3-18 patients. The second part, the focus of this study, will be a single arm cohort , which will further evaluate the safety, as well as efficacy, of TAS-OX in the treatment of mCRC. The subjects in part 2 will be treated with the drug doses determined in Part 1 of the trial. Up to 50 patients will be enrolled in part 2. Anticipated enrollment may be as high as 68 patients.

University of Ulm,OTHER,NCT01392079,"Subcutaneous Alemtuzumab Combined With Oral Dexamethasone, Followed by Alemtuzumab Maintenance or Allo-SCT in CLL With 17p- or Refractory to Fludarabine","A Prospective, Multi-center Phase II Study of Subcutaneous Alemtuzumab Combined With Oral Dexamethasone, Followed by Alemtuzumab Maintenance or Allogeneic Stem-cell Transplantation, in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Which is Associated With 17p Deletion or is Refractory to Fludarabine","Aims and objectives

* Assessment of the efficacy of the study treatment in the study population in terms of response rate, progression-free survival, failure-free survival and overall survival.
* Acquisition of further data to expand the data base on the toxicity of the study treatment.
* Assessment of the efficacy of the study treatment in biological risk groups.
* Assessment of response in terms of minimal residual disease. Number of patients and estimated duration Total no. of patients: 122 (\~29 with 17p deletion for first-line therapy, \~29 with 17p deletion for second- or higher-line treatment, \~65 fludarabine-refractory irrespective of 17p status).

Duration for each patient: Max. 12 weeks of treatment in three 4-week cycles, then up to two years maintenance treatment.","CLL refractory to therapy based on fludarabine or with 17p deletion has a poor prognosis. Patients with F-refractory CLL have a remission rate of 20% after various salvage regimens and a median overall survival (OS) of \<12 months (Keating et al., 2002a). CLL patients with 17p deletion have a median OS of 16 months after first-line treatment with fludarabine or FC in the CLL4 trial of the GCLLSG (Figure 2; Stilgenbauer et al., 2005b; Eichhorst et al., 2006).

Alemtuzumab is the most active single agent in fludarabine-refractory CLL, with remission rates of 30-40% and median OS of 16-28 months (Keating et al., 2002b, Rai et al., 2002). Furthermore, alemtuzumab is of proven efficacy in CLL with 17p deletion and the subcutaneous administration is as effective as the intravenous application (Stilgenbauer \& Döhner, 2002, Lozanski et al., 2004, Stilgenbauer et al., 2004).

However, the outcome of fludarabine-refractory CLL is still poor, owing to the facts that the majority of patients do not achieve a remission and that the average duration of remission is short. Therefore, the current trial aims at achieving: (i) a higher remission rate, by adding high-dose dexamethasone to alemtuzumab, and (ii) prolongation of remission duration and survival by alemtuzumab maintenance or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT). High-dose steroids have shown activity independently of 17p and p53 status, and are effective in debulking large lymph nodes, a weakness of alemtuzumab (Bellosillo et al., 2002, Thornton et al., 2003, Pettitt et al., 2006). Maintenance treatment with alemtuzumab improved remission duration in the CLL4B trial and allogeneic SCT resulted in disease control in high-risk CLL in the CLL3X trial (Wendtner et al., 2004, Dreger et al., 2005).

This is a prospective, open, multi-center Phase II study conducted by the Deutsche CLL Studiengruppe (DCLLSG; German CLL Study Group, GCLLSG). There will be only one treatment group and thus no randomization. The study will be conducted at approximately 40 investigation sites in Germany, Austria and France.

The study will be conducted according to the EG Directive on Good Clinical Practice, the German Arzneimittelgesetz (AMG, 12. Novelle) as well as - with respect to the local activities and regulations - to the corresponding laws in France and Austria.

A total of 122 patients (adults, males and females, in-patients and out-patients; 2 to 10 patients are expected to be recruited by each of the centers) will be recruited, with stratification by detailed diagnosis. The distribution of female and male patients is not relevant for the study as both sexes are affected by CLL and treatment effects are not different in both groups (GCP-V § 7, 2). Recruiting will stop when the 122th. patient has completed the first four-week cycle of treatment. The study will be concluded when the last patient has completed treatment with alemtuzumab according to this protocol. The retrieval of additional follow-up data may be appropriate to achieve mature data in the survival endpoints.

Subcutaneous alemtuzumab (30 mg) will be administered three times weekly (days 1, 3 and 5) along with oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day, days 1-4, every 2 weeks) for at least 4 weeks (corresponding to 12 doses of alemtuzumab, in case of treatment interruption this may take longer than 4 weeks) and, for patients who show at least SD, a maximum of 12 weeks (36 doses of alemtuzumab, in case of treatment interruption this may take longer than 12 weeks). Thereafter, maintenance therapy with alemtuzumab will be instituted for a maximum of two years. If CR (including bone marrow histology and imaging (chest X-ray and ultrasound, CT if indicated) is documented before week 12, i.e. after week 4 (12 doses of 30 mg alemtuzumab) or 8 (24 doses of 30 mg alemtuzumab), maintenance treatment with alemtuzumab will be instituted at this time point.

In this study it is recommended to start the dose of alemtuzumab directly at 30 mg. However, the dose of alemtuzumab can be increased gradually (3 mg day -2, 10 mg day -1 and 30 mg day 1, as in earlier studies), according to the investigators discretion.

Staging will be performed at inclusion to the study and after 12 doses of alemtuzumab (aim: at the end of Week 4), after 24 doses of alemtuzumab (aim: at the end of Week 8), and after 36 doses of alemtuzumab (aim: at the end of Week 12) of treatment. Patients showing progressive disease (PD) (according to NCI criteria) will be withdrawn from the study. If hematological or other toxicity is seen, treatment will be interrupted and the dose will be reduced according to the prescription information.

If after 12 weeks there is stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), then maintenance treatment will be given, with continued subcutaneous alemtuzumab (30 mg every 14 days). Patients for whom stem-cell transplantation is a realistic treatment option will be offered the possibility of receiving allogeneic stem-cell treatment in another clinical trial (CLLX2 or other GCLLSG trial). The latter will however only be offered if (1) the patient is eligible according to protocol and (2) a HLA-compatible donor is available who has given his/her informed consent. There should be a treatment-free period of at least 2 months before SCT, details are specified in the corresponding protocol.

Appropriate premedication and infection prophylaxis will be administered. After each disease staging (i.e. every three months during the maintenance phase), if there is SD, PR or CR, then patients will continue study therapy (alemtuzumab maintenance). Maintenance therapy will be stopped after two years.

During the study, continual monitoring of efficacy and toxicity will be performed. Early stopping rules will be applied if major intolerability is observed.

Response will be assessed by clinical examination, blood counts, clinical chemistry, chest X-ray (plain radiograph of the chest), ultrasound of the abdomen, CT scanning (if indicated), bone marrow cytology and histology (only in cases of possible CR), and assessment of MRD (for molecular response rate only). Time points for response evaluation according to NCI criteria will be after 12 doses, 24 doses, and 36 doses of alemtuzumab. For an uninterrupted treatment course, this will be after 4, 8 and 12 weeks respectively. (If treatment with alemtuzumab is interrupted, then the time points for all subsequent doses, assessments and other procedures will be delayed correspondingly; i.e., the number of doses is the determining factor for elapsed treatment time, and not the calendar date; see above, ""Staging will be performed..."".) Follow-up assessment will continue at three-month intervals for at least three years.

The following time schedule is anticipated for the study:

* Start of recruitment: January 2008
* End of recruitment: September 2011
* End of study procedures (conclusion of maintenance therapy): December 2013 (plus eventual additional follow-up)","Inclusion Criteria:

Istituto Auxologico Italiano,OTHER,NCT05761184,Characterization of Serum Proteome in Subjects With Prader Willi Syndrome (PROTEOMARKER),Characterization of Serum Proteome in Subjects Suffering From Prader Willi Syndrome With Different Degrees of Liver Steatosis,"The lack of serum markers that can be used to identify the levels of steatosis in obese subjects, or that can indicate a rapid progression of the metabolic disease, in which it is very often difficult to perform analyzes with imaging techniques, limits the current evolution from a generalized medicine to a personalized medicine. With the project proposal the aim is to identify serum markers for the characterization of steatosis in subjects affected by genetic obesity, which will most likely also be used in metabolic obesity.","Methods Study design The study includes two phases, a first exploratory phase known as ""discovery"" in which 30 subjects with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) will be analyzed with SOMAscan technology to perform a serum proteomic profile. Hepatic steatosis will be determined by the use of abdominal ultrasound in PWS subjects by establishing the control group (steatosis grade 0/1) and the steatotic one (steatosis grade 2/3). Subsequently, at least two candidate biomarkers will be selected and validated by ELISA in the 30 samples used in the discovery phase (samples already present in our serum bank) and a further 22 samples from PWS patients specifically enrolled for this study.

Patients:

30 subjects already recruited in our previous MIRNOMAPWS project (RC-2018) with genetic diagnosis of PWS, of both sexes and aged between 18 and 45 years in baseline conditions, will be taken into consideration.

For each patient, the following variables will be collected from the medical records:

* anthropometric parameters (height, weight, BMI, waist circumference);
* body composition (lean mass, fat mass), using the impedance measurement technique (BIA);
* levels of steatosis measured with ultrasound according to standard criteria
* basic metabolism, using indirect calorimetry;
* biochemical parameters determining the metabolic syndrome (HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugar);
* blood pressure;
* concomitant hormonal therapies (growth hormone therapy, sex steroids, and/or l-thyroxine).

Serum collection for proteomic analysis: the proteomic analysis will be performed on the 30 samples already available (used for the ""discovery"" phase) and on 22 new patients. Similarly to what was done for the MIRNOMAPWS project (RC-2018), fasting blood samples from new patients will be collected by standard venipuncture in BD Vacutainer® serum separation tubes (BD - Plymouth PL6 7BP, UK) and centrifuged at 1900g at 4°C for 10 min and at 16,000 g at 4°C for a further 10 minutes. The supernatants were frozen at -80°C for long-term storage.

Proteomic analysis: before the proteomic analysis the presence of hemoglobin will be evaluated by spectrophotometer Beckman Coulter® DU®730 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) using the direct spectrophotometric method of Harboe with Allen correction: Hb (g / L) = (167, 2 × A415 - 83.6 × A380 - 83.6 × A450) x 1/1000 × 1 / dilution in dH2O. The cut-off considered for serum will be 0.020 g/L.

For the proteomic characterization of serum, a new high-throughput omics technology based on the SomaLogic SOMAscan platform will be used. The system is based on the detection of SOMAmers (Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers), which are aptameric forms of DNA with high affinity and specificity for the protein target. Furthermore, these aptamers are resistant to nucleotidase activity and demonstrate higher affinity than normal antibodies. The panel used in this study will allow us to evaluate 1500 protein targets that are involved in the development of metabolic diseases, are part of the general inflammatory response, and are of interest in the study of cardiovascular diseases and oncology.

In general, the sensitivity and performance of the test are comparable to that of a normal ELISA kit, with limits for quantification around 100 fM and detection of 40 fM, and the need for only 65 µL of the sample.

Validation of candidates by ELISA: in this phase, at least two of the markers will be validated, identified in the discovery phase, which have demonstrated a significant association with the increase in steatosis in multi-parametric correlation analyses. The validation will be done by quantifying the candidates in the serum samples using specific sandwich-type commercial ELISA kits. As mentioned in the previous section, a total of 52 samples will be measured, 30 of which enrolled for the discovery phase (sera already stored) and another 22 new samples from subjects enrolled for the validation phase.","Inclusion Criteria: i. patients with a genetic diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome; ii. age range 18-45 years

University of Ottawa,OTHER,NCT05695079,Efficacy of Electric Fans for Mitigating Thermal Strain in Older Adults During Heat Waves,Evaluating the Efficacy of Pedestal Fans for Limiting Heat Strain in Elderly Adults During Extreme Heat Events,"With the increasing regularity and intensity of hot weather and heat waves, there is an urgent need to develop heat-alleviation strategies able to provide targeted protection for heat-vulnerable older adults. While air-conditioning provides the most effective protection from extreme heat, it is inaccessible for many individuals. Air-conditioning is also energy intensive, which can strain the electrical grid and, depending on the source of electricity generation, contribute to increasing green house gas emissions. For these reasons, recent guidance has advocated the use of electric fans as a simple and sustainable alternative to air-conditioning. To date, however, only one study has assessed the efficacy of fan use in older adults and demonstrated that fans accelerate increases in body temperature and heart rate in a short-duration (\~2 hours) resting exposure to 42°C with increasing ambient humidity from 30-70%. While subsequent modelling has suggested that fans can improve heat loss via sweat evaporation in healthy older adults at air temperatures up to 38°C, there is currently no empirical data to support these claims. Further, that work assumed older adults were seated in front of a pedestal fan generating an airflow of 3·5-4·5 m/s at the front of the body. This airflow cannot be attained by most marketed pedestal fans. Studies are therefore needed to evaluate the efficacy of fans for preventing hyperthermia and the associated physiological burden in older adults in air temperatures below 38°C and determine whether the cooling effect of fans, if any, is evident at lower rates of airflow.

To address these knowledge gaps, this randomized crossover trial will evaluate body core temperature, cardiovascular strain, dehydration, and thermal comfort in adults aged 65-85 years exposed for 8 hours to conditions experienced during hot weather and heat waves in North America simulated using a climate chamber (36°C, 45% relative humidity). Each participant will complete three randomized exposures that will differ only in the airflow generated at the front of the body via an electric pedestal fan: no airflow (control), low airflow (\~2 m/s), and high airflow (\~4 m/s). While participants will spend most of the 8-hour exposure seated in front of the fan, they will also complete 4 x 10 min periods of 'activities of daily living' (\~2-2.5 METS, light stepping) at \~2 hour intervals to more accurately reflect activity patterns in the home.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

This proposal aims to support and study the GAJJS' pilot implementation of DBT at its facilities using a mixed-methods cross-over design involving a three-phase clinical trial assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of DBT-A adapted for youth in the GAJJS. By the end of the proposed project, the investigators will have (1) established a research team to continue researching SITB interventions in the GAJJS, (2) developed protocols for implementing and evaluating DBT-A adapted for the JJS delivered in person and via telehealth, and (3) preliminary data on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of DBT-A adapted for the JJS.","Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) are a serious public health concern across the United States, and youth involved in the juvenile justice system (JJS) are at particularly high-risk for SITBs. As part of the Georgia State Juvenile Justice System (GAJJS)'s decades long collaboration with researchers to reduce the rates of suicide and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among youth under their care, they identified Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) as an ideal intervention to fit their needs and subsequently made plans to pilot an adapted DBT for JJS in a portion of their facilities. DBT is an evidence-based treatment for individuals with complex clinical presentations, which has demonstrated effectiveness at reducing SITBs when adapted for adolescents (DBT-A). Despite its adoption by several JJSs, the effectiveness of DBT-A has yet to be empirically evaluated. A controlled evaluation of DBT-A in JJS is desperately needed to develop a framework for implementation and assess its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness. However, GAJJS does not have the resources or expertise to evaluate the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness on their own. Therefore, this project proposes to capitalize on this unique opportunity to investigate the GAJJS's implementation of DBT across eight pilot facilities. The investigators propose a mixed-methods cross-over design involving a three-phase clinical trial aimed at assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of DBT-A adapted for youth in the GAJJS. SITB-related outcomes and DBT-A's feasibility and acceptability will be assessed across two different levels of care (i.e., at short- vs. long-term facilities) and service delivery methods (i.e., in-person vs. telehealth). The project will use feedback from stakeholders, collected at multiple timepoints, to design and iterate the adapted DBT-A program to maximize its feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness in the GAJJS. The clinical trial will use administrative clinical, health, and educational data of JJS-involved youth to assess how effective DBT-A is at reducing self-harming behaviors and associated risk factors (i.e., deficits in distress tolerance, emotion dysregulation, and interpersonal skills). By the end of the proposed project, the investigators will have (1) established a research team to continue researching SITB interventions in the GAJJS; (2) developed protocols for implementing and evaluating DBT-A adapted for the JJS delivered in person and via telehealth; and (3) preliminary data on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of DBT-A adapted for the JJS.

This proposal aims to support and study the GAJJS' pilot implementation of DBT at its facilities using a mixed-methods cross-over design involving a three-phase clinical trial assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of DBT-A adapted for youth in the GAJJS. By the end of the proposed project, the investigators will have (1) established a research team to continue researching SITB interventions in the GAJJS, (2) developed protocols for implementing and evaluating DBT-A adapted for the JJS delivered in person and via telehealth, and (3) preliminary data on the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of DBT-A adapted for the JJS. Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) are a serious public health concern across the United States, and youth involved in the juvenile justice system (JJS) are at particularly high-risk for SITBs. As part of the Georgia State Juvenile Justice System (GAJJS)'s decades long collaboration with researchers to reduce the rates of suicide and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among youth under their care, they identified Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) as an ideal intervention to fit their needs and subsequently made plans to pilot an adapted DBT for JJS in a portion of their facilities. DBT is an evidence-based treatment for individuals with complex clinical presentations, which has demonstrated effectiveness at reducing SITBs when adapted for adolescents (DBT-A). Despite its adoption by several JJSs, the effectiveness of DBT-A has yet to be empirically evaluated. A controlled evaluation of DBT-A in JJS is desperately needed to develop a framework for implementation and assess its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness.

Despite this, the prolonged use of surgical and/or N-95 masks in the clinical setting and surgical masks in the non-clinical setting is the current standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The physiologic cost of wearing a respirator was demonstrated in healthy volunteers with mask use during heavy exertion associated with increased respiratory rate, blood pressure and heart rate. N95 use during light exercise increases CO2 intake reduces inspired oxygen and increases the work of breathing. The physiologic effects of N95 fit testing using a hood include higher CO2 levels and lower oxygen levels in the respirator. In patients with ESRD, N95 mask use was associated with reduced PaO2 and increased respiratory rate. The use of surgical masks for prolonged surgeries is associated with decreased SpO2 and increased heart rate, particularly in those over 35 years old. Many studies have suggested that there is a physiologic burden and risk of hypoxia associated with surgical and/or N95 mask use. This pilot study aims to compare baselines with each and both masks and with no mask versus short-duration exertion, which has not yet been done per review of the literature.

Hasanuddin University,OTHER,NCT04206579,Oral Dextrose Formula in Performance of Soccer Athlete,Oral 10% Dextrose Versus Sodium Dextrose Formula in Performance of Soccer Athlete. A Double-Blind Cross Over Randomized Controlled Trial,"I. Title of Proposed Research Project Dextrose 10% Drink Increase Blood Sugar and Sprint Velocity Compared to Sodium Dextrose in Soccer Players

II. Specific Aims This study aims to evaluate the ergogenic effect in terms of blood sugar, VO2 max and sprint speed of dextrose 10% compared with sodium dextrose 10% in young male soccer players.

III. Background Sports drinks are designed to provide CHO, electrolytes, and fluids to the body, which are absorbed very fast from the small intestine. In other words, the period from ingestion until the CHO, electrolytes, and fluids reach the muscles, brain and so on, should be very short. This is the most important advantage of using sports drinks (Simulescu, Ilia, Macarie, \& Merghes, 2019). Commercial sports drinks generally contain both of CHO and sodium; To the best of the investigator's knowledge, there is no trial in which compare the differential effect of solely dextrose supplementation versus sodium dextrose in soccer players in terms of BG concentration, VO2 max and sprint speed, which may give a new paradigm for the available ergogenic sports drink.","Male academy soccer players, included in a trial, received two types of solutions (compound of 150 cc dextrose 10% + 20 mM sodium or single 150 cc dextrose 10%) interchangeably, separated within 120 minutes were completed in a counterbalanced, randomized, double-blind, crossover design. The study was approved by the Faculty of Medicine Hasanuddin University Research Ethics Committee. This trial was conducted at UNM Banta-Bantaeng, Makassar, Indonesia, from April 2019 to May 2019. All participants were within the last meal four hours prior to the test. Exclusion criteria were the use of amylase supplement, suffering from fever and diarrhea, using laxative agents within 24 h, consuming CHO absorption inhibitors, caffeine, creatinine, beta alanine, sodium bicarbonate supplement within 24 h, mean arterial pressure \<65mmHg, knee or muscle injuries, history of diabetes mellitus and heart disease, going through ketogenic diet program, history of gastrointestinal surgery, and total body fat percentages \> 30%.

Dietary intake was collected using two days food recall.

Specific Aims This study aims to evaluate the ergogenic effect in terms of blood sugar, VO2 max and sprint speed of dextrose 10% compared with sodium dextrose 10% in young male soccer players. III. Background Sports drinks are designed to provide CHO, electrolytes, and fluids to the body, which are absorbed very fast from the small intestine. In other words, the period from ingestion until the CHO, electrolytes, and fluids reach the muscles, brain and so on, should be very short. This is the most important advantage of using sports drinks (Simulescu, Ilia, Macarie, \& Merghes, 2019). Commercial sports drinks generally contain both of CHO and sodium; To the best of the investigator's knowledge, there is no trial in which compare the differential effect of solely dextrose supplementation versus sodium dextrose in soccer players in terms of BG concentration, VO2 max and sprint speed, which may give a new paradigm for the available ergogenic sports drink.

National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),NIH,NCT00016679,1-Octanol to Treat Essential Tremor,Dose Finding Study of 1-Octanol in Essential Tremor,"This study will determine the optimal dose of 1-octanol that will safely reduce tremors in patients with essential tremor-a disorder in which the hands, and sometimes the head, shake involuntarily. Current treatments may be ineffective or produce unwanted side effects. Ethanol (the chemical in beer and wine that causes intoxication) reduces tremor in many patients, but patients generally don't use it regularly because it interferes with daily activities. Laboratory studies show that 1-octanol, a drug that is similar to ethanol, may have the same beneficial effect on tremors with less likelihood of intoxication.

Patients 21 years of age and older with essential tremor may be eligible for this 10-day study. Candidates will be evaluated with a neurological examination, blood tests, urinalysis and electrocardiogram (EKG). Those enrolled will be admitted to the hospital for 4 days for 1-octanol administration and monitoring. On day 1, patients will have a medical history and physical examination. A catheter (a thin plastic tube) will be placed in a vein of the forearm for sampling blood. Patients will take one 1-octanol capsule (at one of seven doses) by mouth and will be monitored for tremors and drug side effects. Blood will be sampled periodically in the first 3 hours to determine 1-octanol blood levels. On days 2 and 3, patients will be monitored for additional side effects. On days 3 and 4, laboratory tests (blood and urine) will be done to evaluate liver and kidney function. On day 4, the catheter will be removed and the patient will be discharged from the hospital. A follow-up visit will be scheduled 1 week after discharge for a physical examination and blood, urine and EKG tests.","Essential tremor is a very common movement disorder affecting approximately 1.4% of the population. Response to medications such as beta blockers and mysoline may be only partial or be accompanied by intolerable side effects. Roughly 80% of patients have significant tremor reduction to ethanol although daily use of this as a treatment has potentially serious social and legal consequences. The leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology of essential tremor is unmasking of spontaneous oscillation of neurons in the inferior olive. Both ethanol and 1-octanol have been shown to reduce these spontaneous oscillations in an animal model of essential tremor; however, 1-octanol dose this at a dose much lower than an intoxicating dose suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of essential tremor. Our initial study with 1-octanol at a low, single dose in patients with essential tremor suggested it was both efficacious and safe.

This present study is planned to identify a maximum tolerated dose and broaden the safety and efficacy data in humans. Additionally, we hope to collect further information about the pharmacokinetics of 1-octanol. This study is designed as a phase Ia, unblinded, inpatient study of adults with essential tremor receiving escalating doses of 1-octanol. Cohorts of three will begin dose escalation at the dose previously studied. Each cohort will be followed in inpatient setting for 72 hours ( and outpatient for 1 additional week) during which adverse events, pharmacokinetics and efficacy will be assessed. If no subject achieves dose-limiting toxicity, 3 additional subjects will be recruited to receive the next higher dose. If 1/3 subjects achieves dose-limiting toxicity, the next cohort will receive the same dose. Dose limiting toxicity is defined as the dose that produces dose-limiting toxicity in at least 2 subjects. Maximum tolerated dose will be defined as the next lower dose.

With this study, we hope to identify a range of doses that may useful in the treatment of essential tremor and combined with the pharmacokinetic and efficacy data, design a protocol to study multiple dose regimens over longer time periods.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Our initial study with 1-octanol at a low, single dose in patients with essential tremor suggested it was both efficacious and safe. This present study is planned to identify a maximum tolerated dose and broaden the safety and efficacy data in humans. Additionally, we hope to collect further information about the pharmacokinetics of 1-octanol. This study is designed as a phase Ia, unblinded, inpatient study of adults with essential tremor receiving escalating doses of 1-octanol. Cohorts of three will begin dose escalation at the dose previously studied. Each cohort will be followed in inpatient setting for 72 hours ( and outpatient for 1 additional week) during which adverse events, pharmacokinetics and efficacy will be assessed. If no subject achieves dose-limiting toxicity, 3 additional subjects will be recruited to receive the next higher dose. If 1/3 subjects achieves dose-limiting toxicity, the next cohort will receive the same dose. Dose limiting toxicity is defined as the dose that produces dose-limiting toxicity in at least 2 subjects. Maximum tolerated dose will be defined as the next lower dose. With this study, we hope to identify a range of doses that may useful in the treatment of essential tremor and combined with the pharmacokinetic and efficacy data, design a protocol to study multiple dose regimens over longer time periods. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with essential tremor with a history or ethanol responsiveness. Patients must be off any medications used to treat essential tremor such as mysoline or propranalol for at least 2 weeks. Patients must withhold ethanol and caffeine from 24 hours prior to starting the study until study termination (10 days). EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients with abnormalities on neurologic exam other than tremor. Patients with a history of chronic alcohol dependence. Patients with chronic medical conditions such as renal failure, hepatic failure and chronic lung disease. Patients on other chronic medications that cannot be temporarily discontinued for the length of the study (10 days). Patients, who for moral or religious reasons do not wish to take a potentially intoxicating drug. Patients with abnormalities on their baseline screening laboratory tests. Women who are pregnant or lactating. People of Asian decent who may differ pharmocogenetically with respect to alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase and may have increased sensitivity to alcohols and their metabolites"
Loyola University,OTHER,NCT02951884,Intra-articular Local Anesthetic Injection and Hematoma Aspiration,The Effect of Intra-articular Local Anesthetic Injection and Hematoma Aspiration on Pain and Narcotic Analgesia Use Following Tibial Plateau Fractures,"The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a patient with a tibial plateau fracture (non-displaced, displaced, or depression type) will have decreased pain and narcotic analgesia requirements following an intra-articular injection of local anesthetic and aspiration of the knee.","We propose to study tibial plateau fractures treated at our institution for which we have fracture data, treated with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) procedures or treated non-operatively. Patients will be identified based on the classification of their injury, that being tibial plateau fracture; we will seek to sub-classify each patient based on the Shatzker classification of tibial plateau fractures and using knee osteoarthritis (OA) classification as our prospective study will be based on both tibial plateau fractures as a whole and their sub-classification: Lateral tibial plateau fracture without depression (I), lateral tibial plateau fracture with depression (II), compression fracture of the lateral (IIIA) or central (IIIB) tibial plateau, medial tibial plateau fracture (IV), bicondylar tibial plateau fracture (V), and tibial plateau fracture with diaphyseal discontinuity (VI). It is important for our prospective study to classify each fracture pattern as they generally differ in energy of injury and thus may affect pain management or need for narcotic pain medications and also potentially affect functional outcomes.

Following consent for participation in the study, patients will be blinded to initial management of the tibial plateau fracture with either: Aspiration of the joint alone, aspiration of the knee joint and injection of 20cc bupivacaine 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine, or no injection or aspiration therapy for a control arm. Using the block randomization list, the patient will be randomized at the time of consent for participation. For the sake of consistency, all participating treating physicians (orthopaedic on-call residents) will be trained on Sawbones Fully Encased Knee Joint with Patella and Ligaments for a standardized aspiration and injection technique.

For the patients randomized into the treatment arms, the knee will be held in 15-30 degrees short of full extension and fully prepped using chlorhexidine wipes in a centrifugal manner. An 18 gauge spinal needle will be introduced into the superolateral aspect of the knee (if the knee is too edematous, an inferolateral or inferomedial approach may be appropriate). We will aspirate the knee with a 60cc syringe until we are unable to draw out more fluid and record the volume on a case record form. Subsequently, we will remove the syringe from the needle connection, leaving the 18 gauge needle in place. Then we will draw up 30cc of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine (Marcaine) with .18-gauge needle into the second 60cc syringe. Subsequently, we will place the filled syringe on the 18 gauge needle already in the knee and inject. Then we will remove the needle-syringe construct and place a bandage over the injection site.

The patient's initial numerical rating scale (NRS) score will be recorded immediately. Subsequent visual analogue scale (VAS) scores will be recorded at 5 minutes after intervention and at hours 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 after initial work-up of the patient. Patients treated as an outpatient will record these values themselves. Patients will be directed to bring the completed form with them to their regular clinic follow-up visit. Additionally, supplemental analgesia requirements will be recorded upon administration and will be converted to morphine equivalent units for analysis. All patients admitted to the orthopedic service will be placed on patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) morphine, where the dose is determined by the weight of the patient. All other patients (those admitted to other services) will have analgesia converted to Opioid Morphine Equivalents (OMEs).","Inclusion Criteria:

Ain Shams University,OTHER,NCT03824379,Magnesium Supplementation in Diabetic Nephropathy,The Impact of Magnesium Supplementation on the Clinical Outcome of Patients of Diabetic Nephropathy,"Higher prevalence of hypomagnesaemia in diabetic patients with nephropathy was compared to those without nephropathy. Serum magnesium levels were significantly inversely correlated with serum creatinine and U-A/C ratio, and positively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Hence, Magnesium supplementation using magnesium salts could be a good approach to improve the cardiovascular complications, insulin resistance index, lipid profile and kidney function in diabetic nephropathy patients.","Diabetic nephropathy is a serious kidney-related complication of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. It is also called diabetic kidney disease. Up to 40 percent of people with diabetes eventually develop kidney disease. Over time, elevated blood sugar associated with uncontrolled diabetes causes high blood pressure which in turn damages the kidneys by increasing kidney filtration pressure. Complications of diabetic nephropathy include heart and blood vessel disease (cardiovascular disease), fluid retention and hyperkalemia. Magnesium (Mg) is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and the second most important intracellular cation. It plays an essential role in biological systems as co-factor for more than 300 essential enzymatic reactions such as signal transduction, energy metabolism, vascular processes and bone metabolism. Normal serum Mg concentrations ranges from 0.7 to 1.1 mmol/L (1.4-2.0 mEq/L or 1.7-2.4 mg/dL). Outcome studies in the general population have indicated potential associations between low serum Mg levels and atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, and left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as both CVD mortality and all-cause mortality. Low SMg levels (1.4-1.9 mg/dL; 0.58-0.78 mM) were independently associated with all-cause death in patients with prevalent CKD. Higher prevalence of hypomagnesaemia in diabetic patients with nephropathy compared to those without nephropathy. Serum magnesium levels were significantly inversely correlated with serum creatinine and U-A/C ratio, and positively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Magnesium deficiency promotes hydroxyapatite formation and calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells . It is closely related to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. A lower Mg level is directly associated with a faster deterioration of renal function in T2DM patients. Moreover, hypomagnesemia is associated with the long-term micro- and macrovascular complications of T2DM. A dysregulation of mineral metabolism, reflected by altered levels of magnesium and FGF-23, correlates with an increased urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) in type 2 diabetic patients with CKD stages 2-4. Also, a link between hypomagnesemia and atherogenic dyslipidemia alterations exists; a significantly raised total cholesterol and LDL and non-HDL in patients with CKD are observed, suggesting a link to increased cardiovascular risk in CKD patients. Increasing magnesium levels could attenuate the cardiovascular risk derived from hyperphosphatemia, hence the CKD progression. Current literature suggests that Mg may have a protective effect on the CV system. Mg supplementation improves the insulin resistance index and beta-cell function, and decreases hemoglobin A1c levels in type 2 DM patients. In animal models of vascular calcification VC, dietary supplementation with magnesium results in marked reduction in VC and mortality, improved mineral metabolism, including lowering of PTH, as well as improvement in renal function. Hence, Magnesium supplementation using magnesium salts could be a good approach to improve the cardiovascular complications, insulin resistance index, lipid profile and kidney function in diabetic nephropathy patients.","Inclusion Criteria:

Università degli Studi di Ferrara,OTHER,NCT00929279,Efficacy of Abciximab Bolus Only Regimen in Providing Inhibition of Platelet Action Over Time,Facilitation Through Abciximab By drOpping Infusion Line in Patients Undergoing Coronary Stenting. SYNergy With Clopidogrel at High Loading dOse Regimen,"In full responders to clopidogrel scheduled to undergo PCI for NSTEACS, the use of abciximab bolus only plus 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose will result in a non-inferior inhibition of platelet aggregation after 4 hours as measured by LTA (20micromol ADP) when compared with abciximab plus infusion and 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose.","Based on the outcome of the EPIC trial, and the sub-optimal results with a single abciximab bolus compared with bolus and infusion, it was recommended to prolong platelet inhibition by a 12h infusion of abciximab after the initial bolus administration in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, lower outcomes in the single bolus group in the EPIC study were entirely driven by the rates of urgent repeat revascularization at 30 days (3•6 percent bolus group versus 0•8 percent bolus and infusion group, p \< 0.001), a complication probably related to the lack of stent use at that time. Importantly, there was no significant difference in terms of death or myocardial infarction (MI). Moreover, the use of clopidogrel in patients undergoing coronary stenting may currently reduce the need for infusion after a single abciximab bolus and it is likely that the soon to come availably of even more potent oral thienopyridines with faster onset of action such as prasugrel may further contribute to make post-bolus abciximab infusion of marginal clinical benefit. Yet, it is known that infusion, as compared to bolus only regimen increases the bleeding rate and the incidence of thrombocytopenia. Thus, bolus only regimen has the potential to maintain protection from ischemic complications in patients undergoing PCI while optimizing the safety profile of the treatment in the current era of intervention based on stents and thienopyridines with fast onset of action.

The CLEAR-PLATELETS study has recently shown that 600 mg clopidogrel does not affect the degree of platelet inhibition throughout infusion of eptifibatide, which is consistent with the notion that glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition at steady state leads to near maximal platelet blockade. No study has so far investigated the effect of clopidogrel, given at high loading dose, in patients treated with abciximab bolus only. In particular, it is not known whether the administration of clopidogrel at high loading dose may prolong the effect of abciximab bolus on the degree of platelet inhibition and if so at which time point the combination of abciximab bolus and clopidogrel may become suboptimal in terms of platelet inhibition as compared to currently recommended 12h infusion of abciximab after the initial bolus administration. This information would lead to relevant clinical implications as it may define the time frame for a safe and effective intervention after bolus only of abciximab in current practice.

This is a single-centre, double-blind prospective randomized pharmacodynamic investigation of 2 antiplatelet regimens in patients undergoing coronary stenting for non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTECACS):

1. Abciximab bolus followed by infusion plus on-label clopidogrel administration at 300 mg loading dose.
2. abciximab bolus without infusion plus high loading dose of clopidogrel at 600 mg

The objective of the investigation is to test the hypothesis that the administration of abciximab bolus only plus high loading dose of clopidogrel at 600 mg will provide a non inferior level of inhibition of platelet aggregation 4 hours after administration as compared to abciximab bolus followed by standard infusion in combination with clopidogrel loading dose of 300 mg in patients with normal response to clopidogrel (as evaluated after 14-30 days).","Inclusion Criteria:

Study participants will be patients in a partial hospitalization program or intensive outpatient program for eating disorder.","Subjects participating in this study will receive routine care for eating disorder at a partial hospitalization (PHP) level of care at MSHMC. In PHP, all patients have weekly medical screening visits for the duration of their time in care, as well as weekly individual therapy sessions, individual dietician sessions, and psychiatry appointments. They have supervised meals and numerous group therapy sessions. Every three weeks, patients in PHP complete a battery of mood and eating disorder indices including those evaluated in this study; participants in this study will complete an additional two surveys with this routine battery. Participants in this study will have no alterations in their routine eating disorder care outside of study article use and these additional surveys.

Subjects will be enrolled at their first visit for eating disorder programming at child or adult partial hospitalization (PHP) programming at MSHMC adolescent medicine eating disorders clinic. Informed consent/assent will be obtained as described above.

The subject will be provided with oral naltrexone or placebo weekly from the MSHMC research pharmacy. Subjects will be given one weeks' worth of medication at a time. Subjects will be randomized at enrollment to receive either study drug (naltrexone) or placebo. Participants or parents of minor participants will be provided study drug or placebo following completion of urine drug screen and consent/assent. Patients will take the medication daily for six weeks. For subjects who are enrolled in child PHP and who eat meals with parents, the families may choose to administer study drug during meals at programming. For adult patients enrolled in adult programming, subjects may choose to self-administer the medication.

On their first contact with PHP, all patients in Child PHP complete various eating disorder indices as a part of routine care, including the ED-15, EDE-Q, RCMAS, CDI, GAD-7, and PHQ-9. This battery of indices is repeated every 3 weeks while a patient is in programming.

For those who are enrolled in this study, they will complete their routine indices, in addition they will also complete the BIS/BAS and the ABUSI at enrollment and at weeks 3, 6, and 9 (after completion of medication) while in programming. Participants will receive routine eating disorder care while in PHP.

Patients in Adult PHP typically complete a different inventory every three weeks. If a patient choses to participate in this study they will be asked to complete the same surveys as participants in Child PHP, and they will receive the same amount and type of compensation.

Six months after enrollment, subjects will be sent copies of ED-15, EDE-Q, GAD-7, PHQ-9, BIS/BAS, and ABUSI indices either in an in-person medical appointment or via RedCap to complete. If the patient returns for medical follow-up between 5 and 7 months after enrollment, their height, weight, and body mass index will also be recorded to determine if weight restoration was maintained.

At initial contact with the eating disorders clinic, all patients receive an initial battery of laboratory tests as a part of the standard of care for eating disorder. These tests include liver function assays and transaminase levels.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Ages 13-25 (inclusive)
* Any sex
* Diagnoses of anorexia nervosa binge-purge subtype, bulimia nervosa, purging disorder, or atypical anorexia nervosa with bingeing or purging behaviors according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version 5 diagnostic criteria
* Electing to participate in child or adult partial hospitalization program for eating disorder treatment at MSHMC

The diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa, binge-purge subtype, are:

A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than minimally expected.

B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.

C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight D. During the last three months the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behaviour (i.e. self-induced vomiting, or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).19 E. A diagnosis of atypical anorexia nervosa can be made when the body weight is normal or high If these patients engage in bingeing or purging behaviors as defined in anorexia nervosa, binge-purge subtype, they are eligible for inclusion in this study

The diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa are:

A. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by

B. both:

i. Eating in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2 hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances; ii. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episodes (e.g. a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating.

C. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.

D. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.

E. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. F. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.

• The diagnostic criteria for purging disorder are: recurrent purging behavior to influence weight or shape (e.g. self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications) in the absence of binge eating.

Unity Health Toronto,OTHER,NCT02481479,Saxagliptin and Cardiac Structure and Function,SCARF: Saxagliptin on CArdiac StRucture and Function,"Diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of heart failure, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the development of new therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control, recent clinical data from the saxagliptin assessment of vascular outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (SAVOR-TIMI) 53 study observed an unexpected finding of an excess of adjudicated heart failure hospitalizations. This excess occurred in the setting of pre-existing heart failure (HF) hospitalization and in those with elevated biomarkers for heart failure such as N terminal pro Brain type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). A wealth of preclinical data did not suggest a mechanistic basis for an excess of heart failure events, however these preclinical studies primarily focused upon prevention based strategies as opposed to regression studies once established heart failure was present. This proposal seeks to understand if and how dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i,specifically saxagliptin) may influence the development of heart failure, by evaluating changes in cardiac structure and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","The cardiovascular safety and potential cardioprotective effects of diabetes drugs have been the focus of recent research. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all new anti-diabetic drugs to demonstrate no important increase in cardiovascular adverse events before approval.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are oral incretin-based agents that increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level, with proven anti-hyperglycemic effects and are increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes. In a rat model of diabetes and myocardial infarction, sitagliptin treatment improved passive left ventricular compliance, increased endothelial cell density, reduced myocyte hypertrophy and collagen abundance. GLP-1 and DDP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin improve cardiac function, cardiac remodeling, and survival in animal models of pressure-overload and chronic heart failure. However, in another study of post-MI cardiac remodeling in mice, vildagliptin failed to show any early or late protective effects on cardiac function.

Some clinical studies suggest that GLP-1 infusion is associated with an absolute increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure, although data are conflicting. The GLP-1 receptor analog, exenatide may reduce infarct size in patients with myocardial infarction but does not improve LVEF.

The Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Alogliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome EXAMINE trial randomized assigned 5340 patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome to alogliptin or placebo, and found no increase in adverse cardiovascular events in the alogliptin group. In SAVOR-TIMI 53, 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events were randomized to receive saxagliptin or placebo. Over a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P=0.99 for superiority; P\<0.001 for noninferiority). However, patients in the saxagliptin group were more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure, which was not ascertained in the EXAMINE trial. Furthermore, the Sitagliptin Cardiovascular Outcome Study (TECOS), which examined the DPP4i sitagliptin versus placebo in high risk patients for a cardiovascular event demonstrated cardiovascular safety (P\<0.001 for non inferiority), and there was no signal for excess heart failure hospitalizations.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as the ""gold standard"" for measuring LV volume, mass, and ejection fraction. LV volume measurements by cardiac MRI do not rely on geometric assumptions. CMR measurements have excellent intra-observer, inter-observer, and inter-study variability, which were superior to other imaging techniques. The high inter-study reproducibility of CMR affords a substantial reduction in the required sample size to demonstrate even small changes in LV volume, LV mass or LVEF, or conversely, to reliably exclude clinically important changes. Furthermore, CMR tagging allows detailed and quantitative assessment of regional LV diastolic and systolic function. For example, in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), CMR can detect subtle alterations in global and regional LV functions in patients with traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Although prior studies have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects of improved glycemic control on myocardial function, CMR promises to be a more sensitive and accurate technique.

Despite the development of new therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control, recent clinical data from the saxagliptin assessment of vascular outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (SAVOR-TIMI) 53 study observed an unexpected finding of an excess of adjudicated heart failure hospitalizations. This excess occurred in the setting of pre-existing heart failure (HF) hospitalization and in those with elevated biomarkers for heart failure such as N terminal pro Brain type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). A wealth of preclinical data did not suggest a mechanistic basis for an excess of heart failure events, however these preclinical studies primarily focused upon prevention based strategies as opposed to regression studies once established heart failure was present. This proposal seeks to understand if and how dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i,specifically saxagliptin) may influence the development of heart failure, by evaluating changes in cardiac structure and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The cardiovascular safety and potential cardioprotective effects of diabetes drugs have been the focus of recent research. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all new anti-diabetic drugs to demonstrate no important increase in cardiovascular adverse events before approval. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are oral incretin-based agents that increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level, with proven anti-hyperglycemic effects and are increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes. In a rat model of diabetes and myocardial infarction, sitagliptin treatment improved passive left ventricular compliance, increased endothelial cell density, reduced myocyte hypertrophy and collagen abundance. GLP-1 and DDP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin improve cardiac function, cardiac remodeling, and survival in animal models of pressure-overload and chronic heart failure. However, in another study of post-MI cardiac remodeling in mice, vildagliptin failed to show any early or late protective effects on cardiac function. Some clinical studies suggest that GLP-1 infusion is associated with an absolute increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure, although data are conflicting. The GLP-1 receptor analog, exenatide may reduce infarct size in patients with myocardial infarction but does not improve LVEF. The Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Alogliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome EXAMINE trial randomized assigned 5340 patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome to alogliptin or placebo, and found no increase in adverse cardiovascular events in the alogliptin group. In SAVOR-TIMI 53, 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events were randomized to receive saxagliptin or placebo. Over a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P=0.99 for superiority; P\<0.001 for noninferiority). However, patients in the saxagliptin group were more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure, which was not ascertained in the EXAMINE trial. Furthermore, the Sitagliptin Cardiovascular Outcome Study (TECOS), which examined the DPP4i sitagliptin versus placebo in high risk patients for a cardiovascular event demonstrated cardiovascular safety (P\<0.001 for non inferiority), and there was no signal for excess heart failure hospitalizations. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as the ""gold standard"" for measuring LV volume, mass, and ejection fraction.

Most currently available treatments for depression target neurochemical or neurobiological mechanisms identified retrospectively following discovery of the drug's initial antidepressant efficacy. Unfortunately, conventional pharmacological treatments produce remission in less than 50% of patients, which highlights the need for novel, more selective therapeutics targeting newly discovered pathological mechanisms underlying depression. However, gaps in knowledge regarding the fundamental pathophysiology of depression and other stress-related disorders (including anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder \[PTSD\]) have limited advances in diagnosis and treatment of the illness. Recently, work by the study team and others highlight the promise of understanding the molecular mechanisms of resilience to stress as a novel approach treatment discovery for these disorders.

Accumulating evidence suggests that immunological abnormalities, particularly imbalances in select pro-inflammatory mediators, play important roles in the manifestation and persistence of stress-related disorders such as depression in vulnerable individuals. In humans an acute stress test delivered in a laboratory setting, as discussed below, has been shown to reliably increase levels of circulating inflammatory markers. These inflammatory mediators, in particular interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, have been shown to be elevated in patients diagnosed with depression as well and are now recognized as important biological signatures as well as key mechanistic contributory factors of stress-related disorders . As such, inflammatory mediators are also considered important novel therapeutic targets to promote resilience to stress and potentially prevent and treat depression.

Polyphenols, a select structural class of organic compounds that are abundantly found in some plants, are potent anti-inflammatory reagents. Recent preclinical evidence from the study team's highlights the potential value of a select bioactive polyphenol-rich preparation (Bioactive Dietary Polyphenol Preparation, BDPP) in modulating stress-induced depression phenotypes and enhancing stress resilience. BDPP is comprised of a select Concord grape juice (CGJ), a select grape seed polyphenol extract (GSPE) and trans-resveratrol (RSV). The study team's preclinical evidence suggests that the benefits of BDPP are mechanistically mediated, in part, by the efficacy of select BDPP-derived, biologically available polyphenol metabolites in modulating one or more key inflammatory signatures of stress-induced depressive-like symptoms. In fact, the study team has identified a set of metabolites, including dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), that demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory properties (including IL-6 inhibition) and pro-resilience behavioral effects in a rodent stress model. The study team hypothesized that BDPP treatment may alleviate stress response, in part, by delivering, in vivo, certain biologically available BDPP-derived polyphenol metabolites that are bioactive in modulating systemic expression of one or more inflammatory biological signatures of stress.

Based on the scientific rationale outlined above, this study will characterize the clinical pharmacology of BDPP, including pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability, and test the dose-dependent effect of BDPP on inflammatory markers at baseline and in response to acute stress in healthy volunteers using a rigorous double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled design. Response to acute stress will be measured using the validated human laboratory stress paradigm, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). The results of this study will critically inform future clinical trial testing of BDPP for the treatment stress-related disorders such as depression by establishing key knowledge regarding the clinical pharmacology and biological effects on inflammatory mediators for BDPP metabolites in humans.

Plasma mass of each polyphenol will be used for analysis instead of concentration to adjust for individual differences in volume of distribution (plasma volume). Plasma volume for each participant will be calculated by subtracting blood cell volume (determined by hematocrit) from blood volume. Area under the plasma polyphenol mass by time curve (AUC) will be calculated by the middle Reimann Sum method. After confirming normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test, peak plasma mass and AUC for each metabolite (primarily DHCA) will compared by means of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) between different doses of BDPP, wherein exposure is modeled. Baseline and 24 hours urine polyphenol metabolites will be used as covariates in the analysis. The dose dependent effects of BDPP on markers of inflammation will be tested using the multiple linear regression analysis with corrections for confounding factors (age, gender and BMI). The study team will collect clinical and other biological measures from participants for subsequent analyses to explore associations between changes in blood levels of IL-6 with changes in clinical measures (e.g., perceived stress using the PSS) and biological measures (baseline cortisol levels). The exploratory analyses will perform partial correlations on regression coefficients.","Inclusion Criteria:

Most currently available treatments for depression target neurochemical or neurobiological mechanisms identified retrospectively following discovery of the drug's initial antidepressant efficacy. Unfortunately, conventional pharmacological treatments produce remission in less than 50% of patients, which highlights the need for novel, more selective therapeutics targeting newly discovered pathological mechanisms underlying depression. However, gaps in knowledge regarding the fundamental pathophysiology of depression and other stress-related disorders (including anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder \[PTSD\]) have limited advances in diagnosis and treatment of the illness. Recently, work by the study team and others highlight the promise of understanding the molecular mechanisms of resilience to stress as a novel approach treatment discovery for these disorders. Accumulating evidence suggests that immunological abnormalities, particularly imbalances in select pro-inflammatory mediators, play important roles in the manifestation and persistence of stress-related disorders such as depression in vulnerable individuals. In humans an acute stress test delivered in a laboratory setting, as discussed below, has been shown to reliably increase levels of circulating inflammatory markers. These inflammatory mediators, in particular interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, have been shown to be elevated in patients diagnosed with depression as well and are now recognized as important biological signatures as well as key mechanistic contributory factors of stress-related disorders . As such, inflammatory mediators are also considered important novel therapeutic targets to promote resilience to stress and potentially prevent and treat depression. Polyphenols, a select structural class of organic compounds that are abundantly found in some plants, are potent anti-inflammatory reagents. Recent preclinical evidence from the study team's highlights the potential value of a select bioactive polyphenol-rich preparation (Bioactive Dietary Polyphenol Preparation, BDPP) in modulating stress-induced depression phenotypes and enhancing stress resilience. BDPP is comprised of a select Concord grape juice (CGJ), a select grape seed polyphenol extract (GSPE) and trans-resveratrol (RSV). The study team's preclinical evidence suggests that the benefits of BDPP are mechanistically mediated, in part, by the efficacy of select BDPP-derived, biologically available polyphenol metabolites in modulating one or more key inflammatory signatures of stress-induced depressive-like symptoms. In fact, the study team has identified a set of metabolites, including dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), that demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory properties (including IL-6 inhibition) and pro-resilience behavioral effects in a rodent stress model. The study team hypothesized that BDPP treatment may alleviate stress response, in part, by delivering, in vivo, certain biologically available BDPP-derived polyphenol metabolites that are bioactive in modulating systemic expression of one or more inflammatory biological signatures of stress. Based on the scientific rationale outlined above, this study will characterize the clinical pharmacology of BDPP, including pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability, and test the dose-dependent effect of BDPP on inflammatory markers at baseline and in response to acute stress in healthy volunteers using a rigorous double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled design. Response to acute stress will be measured using the validated human laboratory stress paradigm, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). The results of this study will critically inform future clinical trial testing of BDPP for the treatment stress-related disorders such as depression by establishing key knowledge regarding the clinical pharmacology and biological effects on inflammatory mediators for BDPP metabolites in humans. Plasma mass of each polyphenol will be used for analysis instead of concentration to adjust for individual differences in volume of distribution (plasma volume). Plasma volume for each participant will be calculated by subtracting blood cell volume (determined by hematocrit) from blood volume. Area under the plasma polyphenol mass by time curve (AUC) will be calculated by the middle Reimann Sum method. After confirming normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test, peak plasma mass and AUC for each metabolite (primarily DHCA) will compared by means of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) between different doses of BDPP, wherein exposure is modeled. Baseline and 24 hours urine polyphenol metabolites will be used as covariates in the analysis. The dose dependent effects of BDPP on markers of inflammation will be tested using the multiple linear regression analysis with corrections for confounding factors (age, gender and BMI). The study team will collect clinical and other biological measures from participants for subsequent analyses to explore associations between changes in blood levels of IL-6 with changes in clinical measures (e.g., perceived stress using the PSS) and biological measures (baseline cortisol levels). The exploratory analyses will perform partial correlations on regression coefficients.

According to Kolcaba, comfort is the experience of relief, peace of mind and meeting needs to solve problems. The term comfort has been frequently used in recent years for infants receiving health care in Neonatal and Neonatal Surgery Intensive Care Units. Physical characteristics of the clinic, immaturity of newborns, frequent routine care and invasive procedures (burn dressing, hydrotherapy, blood collection, IV catheter insertion, heel prick, aspiration, nasogastric catheter insertion, foley catheter insertion, rectal tube insertion, neonatal eye examination) cause a decrease in the comfort of newborns.

As a result of rapidly increasing technological developments, changes are also seen in the neonatal discipline and perinatal mortality rates are decreasing, especially in developing countries.

Researchers also want to learn if one of these drugs is more effective than the other at controlling side effects.,"The Study Drugs:

Atorvastatin is designed to lower cholesterol by blocking its production in the liver. This may help to decrease the chances of having a heart attack or a stroke.

Fish oil supplements are designed to lower fat levels in the blood by blocking their production in the liver. This may help to decrease the chances of having a heart attack or a stroke.

Atorvastatin is FDA-approved and commercially available for lowering cholesterol or fat levels in the blood. Fish oil supplements are also commercially available.

Researchers want to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of Atorvastatin and fish oil supplements.

Study Groups:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study ""Part"" based on when you join this study. Up to 132 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study. Up to 120 participants will be enrolled in Part 2 of the study.

If you are enrolled in Part 1, you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 3 groups. You will be provided with enough unmarked capsules for fourteen days plus a test dose. You will take the test dose in the clinic in the presence of the research nurse. Beginning 5 days before lung surgery (Day -5), you will take 1 capsule in the morning, as well as 3 capsules 2 time each day (a total of 7 unmarked capsules each day) for 5 days. The capsules should be taken with a cup (8 ounces) of water and may be taken with or without food. You will be reminded by the research nurse to bring the remaining capsules from home prior to your admission for surgery.

* If you are in Group 1, the capsules you will take will be fish oil supplements and placebo. A placebo is a substance that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredients.
* If you are in Group 2, the capsules you will take will be atorvastatin and placebo.
* If you are in Group 3, the capsules you will take will be placebo only.

You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group. Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.

After Part 1 is complete, the groups will be compared to learn if any group was more effective than the others. If neither fish oil supplements nor atorvastatin is shown to be more effective than the placebo, the study will be stopped. If fish oil or atorvastatin is found to be more effective than the placebo, the study will continue to Part 2.

If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study groups. You will be provided with enough unmarked capsules for fourteen days plus a test dose. You will take the test dose in the clinic in the presence of the research nurse, and begin taking capsules 5 days before surgery (Day -5) for 5 days. If atorvastatin was found to be the more effective drug in Part 1, you will take 1 unmarked capsule in the morning each day. If fish oil was found to be the more effective drug in Part 1, you will take 3 capsules 2 times each day (a total of 6 unmarked capsules each day). The capsules should be taken with a cup (8 ounces) of water and may be taken with or without food.

You will be reminded by the research nurse to bring the remaining capsules from home prior to admission for surgery.

* If you are in Group 1, the capsules you will take will be the drug that was found to be more effective in Part 1 (either fish oil supplements or atorvastatin).
* If you are in Group 2, the capsules you will take will be placebo only.

You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group. Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.

Surgery:

After you have taken the study drug/placebo for 5 days, you will have standard of care lung surgery performed. You will be given a separate consent form to read and sign for the surgery.

On the day of surgery, any unused capsules will be collected and the days, times, and reasons why any doses were missed will be recorded. You will then continue taking the study drug/placebo for up to 9 days after surgery or until you are released from the hospital (whichever comes first). You will follow the same dosing schedule you followed before surgery.

Study Visits:

Each day while you are in the hospital, your vital signs will be measured and you will be checked for any allergic reaction you may have had to the study drug/placebo.

On Days 1 and 3, and on the last day that you take the study drug/placebo, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your liver function.

About 4-6 weeks after surgery, you will have a follow-up visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.
* You will be asked about any symptoms and/or side effects you may have had.
* Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your liver function.

Length of Study:

You will take the study drug/placebo for 5 days before surgery, and for up to 9 days after surgery (up to a total of 14 days). Your participation in the study will be over after the follow-up visit. You will be taken off study early if you have intolerable side effects (such as allergic reaction or abnormal liver function tests).

Accurate tumor localization is of utmost importance as complete resection increases the chance of cure and improves patient outcomes even when cure is not possible. However, finding the primary tumor can be very challenging and, in some cases, impossible. With the recent FDA approval of a PET tracer (Ga-68 DOTATATE) that binds to somatostatin receptors for imaging neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), the investigator's institution has the opportunity to dramatically improve the surgical care for these patients. Therefore, the aim for this study is to develop a molecular image-guided surgery program starting with GI NETs. GI NETs are malignant neoplasms that are increasing in prevalence. NETs cause a variety of debilitating symptoms, and, as a result, contribute substantially to cancer-related morbidity. Since the primary treatment for NET is surgical resection, NETs are an ideal model to launch a comprehensive image-guided surgery program. Many NETs are metastatic at presentation or will develop metastases during their course, and it is difficult to identify all disease visually and through manual palpation. Failure to surgically resect all disease leads to symptoms, metastatic disease, and multiple surgical interventions. Many institutions have recently begun using Ga-68 DOTATATE for PET/CT imaging of NETs, and this same tracer can be used for intra-operative localization of primary NETs as well as metastases. The primary impediment to using Ga-68 DOTATATE for this purpose is the need to develop and validate a high-energy gamma (HEG) probe for detecting NETs during surgery. This study will explore the new PET tracer technology and begin a molecular image-guided surgery program for NETs. This initial paradigm will be used to develop a molecular image guided approach to other cancers.

Graston ® technique is a form of IASTM that requires completion of a certification course and utilizes specific stainless-steel tools.

One method by which these improvements are thought to occur is by increasing blood flow. Increased blood flow brings nutrients and oxygen to the area and is thought to contribute to tissue remodeling. There is very limited research investigating blood flow changes following IASTM. In order to measure blood flow changes following IASTM, doppler ultrasound may be used. There are no studies to our knowledge quantifying changes in blood flow following IASTM using ultrasound. Power doppler approximates perfusion by detecting a frequency shift from movement of red blood cells and color is then encoded proportionally to the number of red blood cells.

"Rigshospitalet, Denmark",OTHER,NCT05498779,Ablation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: a Nationwide Study,Ablation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: a Nationwide Study,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy in the liver. Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a significant risk factor and may be associated with inferior outcome. According to the Danish national guidelines, ablation should be offered patients with early HCC (tumor \< 3 cm) in a cirrhotic liver, who are not transplant candidates. However, the effect of size of the HCC tumor and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) as etiology are insufficiently investigated.

Purposes

1. Investigate association between HCC tumor size and survival and recurrence after ablation.
2. Investigate survival and recurrence after ablation in patients with HCV-related HCC compared with HCC due to other etiologies.

Methods This study is based on data from the Danish Liver and Bile Duct Cancer Database (DLGCD) and the Danish Database for Hepatitis B and C (DANHEP) and the laboratory database (DANVIR), which collectively include information on patient characteristics, tumor characteristic, laboratory results, and information regarding ablation, HCV status, and antiviral treatment, respectively.

Perspectives Ablation has been widely used for decades, but studies investigating the effect of ablation for HCC in patients with HCV and size of HCC are lacking. This study will contribute considerably to the level of evidence and may impact both Danish and international guidelines for HCC treatment.","Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver and accounts for 85-90% of liver cancer. The most important risk factor for HCC is cirrhosis of any etiology. Among other major risk factors for HCC are chronic viral infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), chronic alcohol consumption and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Three nationwide databases and medical records will be used to address these important knowledge gaps. First, the association between survival and recurrence after ablation and HCC tumor size will be investigated. Second, the survival and recurrence after ablation in patients with HCC related to HCV will be investigated. due to HCV is different from that in patients with HCC due to other reasons than HCV. The nationwide data in these databases will reflect general clinical practice in an unselected population and provide novel information.

Purpose

With data from the Danish Liver and Bile Duct Cancer Database (DLGCD), the Danish Database for Hepatitis B and C (DANHEP), the National hepatitis laboratory database (DANVIR), and medical records, prognostic factors for survival in a large cohort of patients with HCC treated with ablation therapy will be investigated with the following aims:

1. Investigate association between HCC tumor size and survival and recurrence after ablation therapy.
2. Investigate survival and recurrence after ablation therapy in patients with HCV-related HCC compared with HCC due to other etiologies.

Hypotheses

1. Survival and recurrence after ablation is lower in patients with large HCC tumors than in patients with small tumors. However, the cut-off in current Danish guidelines is too conservative.
2. The survival after ablation is lower in patients with HCC due to HCV than in patient with HCC due to other reasons.

Methods This study is based on data from three large, nationwide databases in Denmark. DLGCD is an ongoing prospective nationwide database for patients treated for HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal liver metastases, or non-colorectal liver metastases. The database was established in 2012 and started collecting data in 2013. So far, data from the DLGCD have not been published. To date, the database includes data on 5056 surgical procedures in 2975 patients with HCC. To study the effect of etiology on survival and recurrence after treatment for HCC, data from the DANHEP and DANVIR databases will be incorporated. The three databases can be linked together as they all use CPR number to identify patients. DLGCD does not contain any information on HCV. However, DANHEP and DANVIR are nationwide databases that contain detailed information on individuals with chronic viral hepatitis in Denmark. DANHEP is a database with ongoing prospective registration of adult patients treated at a hospital (outpatient or inpatient) with chronic viral hepatitis B or C, established in 2002. DANVIR is a laboratory database containing information about HCV test (bot positive and negative) since 1991. The observation period of the study will be from 2013 to 2022. With data from the DANHEP and DANVIR databases, patients with HCC that have been infected with HCV can be identified to study the effect of ablation in HCV-infected patients versus patients without HCV infection.

Statistics The dataset will be described with frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means or medians for continuous variables. For investigating differences, Student's t -test or Mann-Whitney U for continuous data and Pearson chi2 or Fisher's exact tests for categorical data will be used as appropriate. To determine risk factors affecting prognosis, recurrence and survival outcomes after ablation, Cox proportional hazard regression model will be used to calculate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals in both univariable and multivariable analyses. The multivariable analysis will be adjusted for age, sex, number of tumor, size of largest tumor, HCV-status, HBV-status, and Child-Pugh score. In addition, survival will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods with log-rank tests for HCV vs. non-HCV groups. It is possible that some patients with HCC never had a test for HCV. In a sensitivity analysis, only patients with HCC that had a HCV test (positive or negative) will be included. For recurrence we will use Fine-Gray proportional subhazards model and Aalen-Johansen estimator with death and transplantation as competing risks. The level of statistical significance will be set to p\<0.05. All statistical analyses will be performed using R, version 4.0.3.

Perspectives With data from nationwide databases, the aim is to investigate survival and recurrence for HCC and the significance of tumor size and etiology of HCC in a large group of patients. Ablation has been widely used for decades, but the majority of published studies within this area are from Asia and based on small cohorts of highly selected patients. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no previous larger studies have determined the effect of ablation in patients with HCV-related HCC. Evidence will be improved with a large, Danish cohort reflecting outcomes in general clinical practice in unselected patients. The study has potential to contribute to the future guidelines regarding indication for ablation.","Inclusion Criteria:

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),NIH,NCT00669084,Innate and Acquired Resistance to Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria in Mali,Studies of Innate and Acquired Resistance to P. Falciparum Malaria in Mali,"This study, sponsored by NIAID and the University of Bamako, Mali, will identify genetic and other factors that may protect against severe malaria in some children.

Children between 6 months and 17 years of age who live in Kenieroba, Fourda or Bozokin villages in Mali may enroll in the study. Participants have a blood sample collected by finger prick with a small needle. The blood is examined for gene variants that influence the severity of disease in children exposed to the malaria parasite.

Children who develop a fever or other symptoms of malaria are evaluated and treated in Kenieroba s health center for up to 5 years from entering the study, or until they reach 18 years of age. The children are treated with artesunate and amodiaquine. Children with severe disease are treated with quinine. One tablespoon of blood is drawn from the children for study.

At the end of the dry season and the wet season, a subset of 200 healthy children are asked to provide 1 or 2 tablespoons of blood, drawn through a needle placed in a vein in the arm. Additional research blood samples may be requested from children between 2 and 17 years old. Blood will not be taken from any child more than twice a year.

...","Hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cell (RBC) polymorphisms that give rise to HbS, HbC, alpha-thalassemia, G6PD-deficiency, and ABO blood groups occur at high frequency in Mali. To determine whether these Hb/RBC polymorphisms are associated with protection against mild malaria and malaria-associated anemia, we will conduct a cohort study in Mali. Approximately 1300 children will be genotyped for five Hb/RBC polymorphisms and followed for 5 years to compare mean incidence rates for mild malaria, stratified by polymorphism. Differences between Hb levels during acute malaria episodes and at baseline will be calculated to determine if Hb/RBC polymorphisms influence the degree of malaria-associated anemia. To investigate whether Hb/RBC polymorphisms impair monocyte activation, we will obtain parasites from children with malaria, culture them in RBCs of different genotype, and compare the parasitized RBCs for their ability to activate monocytes in vitro. Plasma samples from children with malaria will also be compared for their levels of monocyte-derived cytokines. A variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune response genes have recently been identified in African populations. To determine whether these polymorphisms are associated with protection against severe malaria, we will compare the prevalence of SNPs in groups of children with severe or mild malaria. Blood Collection Study. Components of the innate immune system (e.g., Toll-like receptors) expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC) provide the first line of defense against microbial infection and frame the nature and scale of adaptive immune responses. To investigate whether APC from malaria-experienced individuals respond to TLR ligands in vitro stimulation assays, we will obtain blood samples from 100 healthy children in the dry season and again in the wet season. Immunological memory is a key feature of adaptive immunity and involves memory T cells. Clinical trials in which malaria-nafve human volunteers were vaccinated with merozoite MSP-1 antigens enabled us to study the development of immunological memory by measuring memory T cell cytokine production and expression of surface activation markers. To investigate whether memory T cells from malaria-experienced individuals respond similarly to AMA-I/MSP-1 ligands in vitro stimulation assays, we will obtain blood samples from an additional 100 healthy children in the dry season and again in the wet season. These collections of paired samples will enable us to explore the possibility that TLR- and AMA-1/MSP-l-induced immune responses are boosted during a transmission season and increase with age (a surrogate for disease controlling immunity).","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

This new way measures the heart's pumping activity from outside the body, instead of breaking the skin and measuring it from the inside.

Subjects will breathe normally through a mask while we record how fast and how much air they are breathing. We will have them ""re-breathe"" some of the air they breathed out by adjusting the ventilator. During this time, we will use the air breathed out to calculate how much blood per minute the subject's heart is pumping. We will also measure how much blood the heart is pumping at this time by injecting fluid into the catheter in the neck and then drawing about 1 teaspoon of blood from the catheters in the neck and arm. We will compare the calculated and measured values of the amount of blood pumped out of the heart for accuracy.

After we complete this procedure, we will remove the mask and allow you to rest for 10-30min. Following the rest period, we will repeat the process and collect a second set of measurements. We will draw a total of 4 teaspoons of blood for the study.

If you cannot comfortably breathe along with the ventilator, we will withdraw you from the study. If you want to stop taking part in the study at any time, let the study doctor know that you wish to withdraw. We will take off the mask, and your time in the study will end.

This new way measures the heart's pumping activity from outside the body, instead of breaking the skin and measuring it from the inside. Subjects will breathe normally through a mask while we record how fast and how much air they are breathing. We will have them ""re-breathe"" some of the air they breathed out by adjusting the ventilator. During this time, we will use the air breathed out to calculate how much blood per minute the subject's heart is pumping. We will also measure how much blood the heart is pumping at this time by injecting fluid into the catheter in the neck and then drawing about 1 teaspoon of blood from the catheters in the neck and arm. We will compare the calculated and measured values of the amount of blood pumped out of the heart for accuracy. After we complete this procedure, we will remove the mask and allow you to rest for 10-30min. Following the rest period, we will repeat the process and collect a second set of measurements. We will draw a total of 4 teaspoons of blood for the study. If you cannot comfortably breathe along with the ventilator, we will withdraw you from the study. If you want to stop taking part in the study at any time, let the study doctor know that you wish to withdraw. We will take off the mask, and your time in the study will end. This decision will not affect your regular medical care. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Patient is already monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter and arterial line (not for the purpose of this study); 2. Hemodynamic stability. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Patients with facial deformity, heavy beard or moustache which prevents good seal between the mask and the face; 2. Patients who have central nervous system disorders that might be adversely affected by CO2 rebreathing, such as head trauma patients with increased intracranial pressure; 3. Patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation; 4. Patients with intra-cardiac shunts; 5. Patients who cannot cooperate and synchronize with the ventilator; 6. Patients with unstable respiratory conditions, such as acute respiratory failure; 7. Patients who have claustrophobia and cannot wear the mask. 8. Patients with aortic stenosis. 9.

National Cancer Institute (NCI),NIH,NCT01445379,Phase I Study of Ipilimumab (Anti-CTLA-4) in Children and Adolescents With Treatment-Resistant Cancer,"A Phase I Study of Ipilimumab (Anti-CTLA-4) in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults With Treatment Refractory Cancer","This study will examine the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab-an experimental cancer treatment drug used to boost immune response-in children, adolescents, and young adults. Ipilimumab may allow immune cells to react to and destroy abnormal cells in the body, and has been tested in adults for a variety of cancers and has shown responses in some research studies. Because ipilimumab has not been tested in children, adolescents, or young adults, it is considered an experimental drug. The purposes of this research study are to determine the highest safe dose of ipilimumab for children, adolescents, and young adults with solid tumor cancers; examine its effectiveness and possible side effects; and better understand how the body and the immune system process it over time.

Candidates must be between 2 and 21 years of age and must have solid malignant tumors that have been resistant to standard therapy. Volunteers will be screened with a medical history, a clinical examination, and computerized scans such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants must have completed their last dose of chemotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, or antibody or investigational therapy at least four weeks prior to enrollment.

During the study, participants will receive an intravenous dose of ipilimumab once every three weeks. The infusion of ipilimumab will last 90 minutes, and the participant s vital signs will be monitored while the medicine is infusing and several times in the first 24 hours after the first dose (requiring a hospital stay during that time). If the participant is able to tolerate the first dose of ipilimumab, further doses (called cycles ) may be received on an outpatient basis. Blood and urine tests will be given on a regular basis during these cycles. After four cycles, participants whose tumors do not grow and who do not have unacceptable side effects will continue to receive ipilimumab every three months to maintain the current condition, until researchers conclude the study.","Background:

Solid tumors represent approximately one fourth of cancer diagnoses in children. Despite intensive regimens, patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors have unsatisfactory survival rates. Therefore new therapies are needed to improve outcomes.

Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of biologic approaches to heighten antitumor immunity in order to improve the effectiveness of immune based therapy. Both directly activating immune based therapies such as cytokines and tumor vaccines as well as therapies which disrupt negative counterregulatory signals such as those mediated by CTLA-4:B7 may enhance existent antitumor immune responses.

Antibodies directed against CTLA-4 potently augment immune responses in animal models and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor effects in a variety of preclinical tumor models.

Phase I and phase II studies using ipilimumab have been performed in adults with a variety of tumor types. Clinical responses have been observed in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer. No trials have yet been performed to evaluate ipilimumab in children with malignancy.

Objectives:

To determine the tolerance and toxicity profile of ipilimumab at a range of doses up to, but not exceeding, the highest dose tolerated in adults, in patients less than or equal to 21 years of age with refractory solid tumors.

To assess the pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab administered intravenously in patients less than or equal to 21 years of age with advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.

Eligibility:

Patients must be 1-21 years of age at the time of enrollment with solid malignant tumors refractory to standard therapy.

Design:

A Phase I dose finding study with 4 planned dose levels.

Three patients will be enrolled at each dose level with an expanded cohort of 12 at the highest or maximum torlerated dose with intent to include 6 patients \< 12 years.

Re-induction with 4 infusions of ipilimumab at the assigned dose followed by another maintenance phase is possible for subjects who have progressed during maintenance therapy.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Ipilimumab may allow immune cells to react to and destroy abnormal cells in the body, and has been tested in adults for a variety of cancers and has shown responses in some research studies. Because ipilimumab has not been tested in children, adolescents, or young adults, it is considered an experimental drug. The purposes of this research study are to determine the highest safe dose of ipilimumab for children, adolescents, and young adults with solid tumor cancers; examine its effectiveness and possible side effects; and better understand how the body and the immune system process it over time. Candidates must be between 2 and 21 years of age and must have solid malignant tumors that have been resistant to standard therapy. Volunteers will be screened with a medical history, a clinical examination, and computerized scans such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants must have completed their last dose of chemotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, or antibody or investigational therapy at least four weeks prior to enrollment. During the study, participants will receive an intravenous dose of ipilimumab once every three weeks. The infusion of ipilimumab will last 90 minutes, and the participant s vital signs will be monitored while the medicine is infusing and several times in the first 24 hours after the first dose (requiring a hospital stay during that time). If the participant is able to tolerate the first dose of ipilimumab, further doses (called cycles ) may be received on an outpatient basis. Blood and urine tests will be given on a regular basis during these cycles. After four cycles, participants whose tumors do not grow and who do not have unacceptable side effects will continue to receive ipilimumab every three months to maintain the current condition, until researchers conclude the study. Background: Solid tumors represent approximately one fourth of cancer diagnoses in children. Despite intensive regimens, patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors have unsatisfactory survival rates. Therefore new therapies are needed to improve outcomes. Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of biologic approaches to heighten antitumor immunity in order to improve the effectiveness of immune based therapy. Both directly activating immune based therapies such as cytokines and tumor vaccines as well as therapies which disrupt negative counterregulatory signals such as those mediated by CTLA-4:B7 may enhance existent antitumor immune responses. Antibodies directed against CTLA-4 potently augment immune responses in animal models and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor effects in a variety of preclinical tumor models. Phase I and phase II studies using ipilimumab have been performed in adults with a variety of tumor types. Clinical responses have been observed in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer. No trials have yet been performed to evaluate ipilimumab in children with malignancy. Objectives: To determine the tolerance and toxicity profile of ipilimumab at a range of doses up to, but not exceeding, the highest dose tolerated in adults, in patients less than or equal to 21 years of age with refractory solid tumors. To assess the pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab administered intravenously in patients less than or equal to 21 years of age with advanced and/or refractory solid tumors. Eligibility: Patients must be 1-21 years of age at the time of enrollment with solid malignant tumors refractory to standard therapy. Design: A Phase I dose finding study with 4 planned dose levels. Three patients will be enrolled at each dose level with an expanded cohort of 12 at the highest or maximum torlerated dose with intent to include 6 patients \< 12 years. Re-induction with 4 infusions of ipilimumab at the assigned dose followed by another maintenance phase is possible for subjects who have progressed during maintenance therapy. * INCLUSION CRITERIA: AGE: Patients must be greater than or equal to 1 years and less than or equal to 21 years of age. DIAGNOSIS: Histologically confirmed solid tumors, which may include but are not limited to rhabdomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas, Ewing s sarcoma family of tumors, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilm s tumor, Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients with melanoma are eligible. Patients with a previous history of CNS metastases are eligible if the metastases have been treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy, are clinically stable as evidenced by no requirements for corticosteroids, the patient has no evolving neurologic deficits and no progression in residual brain abnormalities without specific therapy over 4 weeks.

NHS Lothian,OTHER_GOV,NCT02438579,Hypertonic Saline Nasal Irrigation and Gargling for the Common Cold.,"Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS). A Pilot Randomised Control Trial of Hypertonic Saline Nasal Irrigation and Gargling on Individuals With the Common Cold to Assess Recruitment, Retention, Side Effects & Effectiveness","Viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), one of the commonest infection faced by humans, have a significant impact on individuals, families, health service and economy. Though rhinoviruses are called the ""common cold virus"", numerous viruses can cause URTI. Hence virus specific remedy for URTI is impractical. There are currently no evidence-based interventions that reduce the severity, symptom duration or viral shedding. Preliminary evidence suggests that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) may reduce the duration of symptoms.

With this pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), the investigators aim to assess the feasibility of undertaking a definitive RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI. This pilot focuses on recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely effect size of the intervention.

This pilot RCT compares HSNIG vs. usual care in 60 adults. Serial self-collected mid-turbinate swabs will help assess change in viral shedding. Symptomatic relief is measured by a validated symptom score. A questionnaire based participant feedback will help assess intervention and trial procedures.

This mixed-methods pilot trial will help inform plans for a definitive RCT of this low-cost intervention that has the potential of substantial health and societal benefits.","1. Aims:

   To assess the feasibility of undertaking a RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI focusing on recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely effect size of the intervention.

   1.1. Research questions:
   1. What is the likely rate of recruitment and loss to follow-up?
   2. Are the study procedures acceptable to participants?
   3. Is there a likely reduction in duration of symptoms and viral shedding?
   4. What effect size is estimated for the definitive trial in relation to duration of symptoms and improvement in quality-of-life?
2. Subjects:

   2.1 Sample size: This is a pilot trial so no formal sample size calculations are indicated. However, with a sample size of 27 per group the investigators would be able to express the proportion of those who return the symptom score diary and samples within that group to within ±19% based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval around an expected proportion of 0.5. With the two groups combined \[i.e. a sample size of 54\] the investigators would be able to express a proportion to within ±13%. To allow for 10% dropouts the sample size has been increased to 30 per group.

   2.2 Recruitment: The investigators propose to enrol a total of 60 participants (30/arm) for this pilot. The investigators plan to recruit by advertising the study in the community by the following routes.
   * Sending flyers to parents through schools run by Edinburgh and Midlothian councils.
   * Study website (www.elvisstudy.com), National Health Service (NHS) Lothian, University of Edinburgh websites.
   * Local media coverage by way of interviews.
   * Flyers in workplaces with large numbers of staff (e.g. banks, supermarkets, councils).
   * Posters in pharmacies and General practitioner (GP) surgeries.

   Interested individuals will be asked to contact the trial nurse at the clinical research facility (CRF) situated at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) and Western General Hospital within 48 hours of symptom onset. The trial nurse will consent, randomise, and recruit volunteers. Participants will be advised to go to their GP as per norm if they become unwell and that they can withdraw from the study if they so wish for other reasons. At the end of their participation in the study, they will be given £30 as recompense for any inconvenience.
3. Research Methods:

   3.1 Randomisation: Participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive intervention or control, this has been done using an online randomisation minimised by sex (M/F) and smoking status (current/not a current smoker) and allocated to each treatment arm with a probability 0.9 to ensure a random allocation.

   3.2 Instructions to participants: 3.2.1 Both arms: Participants are taught to complete (online or paper) a modified short Wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey (WURSS-21-Scot) and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Baseline symptom scores are recorded by the participant.

   Participants are taught to collect nasal swabs. A baseline swab is collected under observation and sent to the virology laboratory at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE). Swabs, transport medium and Royal Mail Safebox will be provided to the participant to collect a nasal swab first thing in the morning (before HSNIG for the intervention arm) for four consecutive days and return to the laboratory.

   3.2.2 Intervention arm: The intervention group will be shown a video on preparing the hypertonic sea-salt solution and how to perform HSNIG. They will be asked to perform the procedure under supervision. The trial nurse will help them identify the highest concentration of saline they are comfortable with. Participants are advised to perform the intervention as frequently as required (expected frequency around 6 times/day for the first two days, reducing in frequency from day 3 as symptoms improve). A package containing instructions, digital-measuring spoon, sea-salt, and equipment for irrigation and flask (if they wish to prepare solution for multiple uses during the day) will then be handed over to the participant. Participants in the intervention arm will also document compliance and side effects daily

   3.2.3 Control arm: They are advised to manage the URTI as they normally do.

   3.3 Data collection: 3.3.1 ""WURSS-21-Scot"" diary and EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire: All participants will complete the ""WURSS-21-Scot"" diary at a set time during the day. Participants will answer the question ""how unwell do you feel today"". If they score \>0, then symptoms and functional ability are graded 0-7. They then answer the global change question. Total score/day is calculated by summing the scores of all 10 symptoms daily. All participants will also answer the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.

   The following information is collected at recruitment: where they heard about the study, influenza vaccination history, number of family members and whether sufficient information was provided.

   The intervention arm will also answer the following questions daily: how many times they performed HSNIG, if they performed one or both parts of HSNIG and if there were any side effects.

   Both arms will answer if they had to take any medications for the URTI and whether they needed to contact the GP for further management of their URTI.

   Diaries are maintained until participant records ""not unwell"" on two consecutive days or for a maximum of 14 days or until follow up is terminated because the individual needs further treatment.

   3.3.2 Virology: Swabs will be sent to the Department of Virology, RIE for testing. Baseline samples will be tested to identify individuals in whom an aetiology can be proven. If a viral aetiology is identified, all samples (day 0 - day 4) will be tested in parallel to identify change in viral shedding.

   3.3.3 Data collection procedures: The trial nurse will follow up participants who do not complete the diary or return samples (after 48 hours of expected return). Information on number of family members with URTI will be collected at the end of the study. Feedback will be collected from participants after the follow-up period. These will address acceptability, health service use, costs to the patient and suggestions for improving the study procedures for the main trial.
4. Data Analysis:

The number of participants returning swabs, completing diaries and following treatment as per protocol will be presented as percentages (with 95% confidence intervals). The investigators will present recruitment as an overall rate, but also graphically as there is likely to be seasonal variation. Using results from the swabs the investigators will determine when a person stops viral shedding and, using chi-square and chi-square test for trend, determine if there is a relationship between groups. Using two-sample t-tests or non-parametric equivalent as appropriate the investigators will determine if there is any evidence of a difference in the duration of symptoms and symptom severity \[as defined by the maximum WURSS-21-Scot score over treatment period\]. Feedback will be analysed using a conventional content analysis approach, with emerging findings discussed by the research team to aid interpretation of findings.","Inclusion Criteria:

Uşak University,OTHER,NCT06652984,Effectiveness of Mobile Respiratory Training in Ankylosing Spondylitis,Effectiveness of Respiratory Muscle Training Using a Mobile Respiratory Trainer in People With Ankylosing Spondylitis,"Introduction and aim; Low functionality of respiratory muscles is frequently observed in various diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and rheumatological diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis. Strengthening the respiratory muscles is a part of the treatment in such disease groups, and it has been reported that the quality of life of patients increases with the improvement in the respiratory muscles. Stavrou et al. In a study published in 2021, they achieved an increase in VO2max and maximum respiratory power in athletes after an exercise program with the AirOFit PRO™ (AirOFit, Copenhagen, Denmark) branded mobile breathing exercise device, which they introduced as a new technology. However, there is no study yet reporting the use of this device in rheumatological diseases.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of personalized breathing exercises with the AirOFit PRO™ (AirOFit, Copenhagen, Denmark) branded mobile breathing exercise device on respiratory muscles and functional exercise capacity, as well as on specific outcomes of the disease, in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

Hypotheses of the study;

a) Hypothesis H1: Personalised breathing exercises applied with a mobile respiratory exercise device in patients with ankylosing spondylitis have a positive effect on respiratory capacity and activities of daily living in patients.","Inflammation of the thoracic and costovertebral joints in ankylosing spondylitis causes gradual fusion and ossification over time, which adversely affects costal mobility and thoracic expansion. In some patients, this leads to increased dorsal kyphosis, thoracic stiffness and permanent limitation of chest wall motion. Expansion and reduced lung volume as a result of mechanical constriction caused by ankylosis of the thoracic joints explains the restrictive breathing pattern in these patients. In addition, previous studies have shown that the inflammatory process of the disease causes pain and stiffness in the thoracic joints, contributing to decreased respiratory function. It is thought that breathing exercises that strengthen the inspiratory muscles may prevent or delay complications that may occur due to inspiratory muscle weakness. Previous studies in the literature have examined the effectiveness of inspiratory muscle training in different disease groups. However, few studies in patients with ankylosing spondylitis have examined the effect of inspiratory muscle training on pulmonary function and aerobic capacity. According to our current knowledge, there is no academic study in the international literature using the mobile respiratory exercise device AirOFit PRO™ (AirOFit, Copenhagen, Denmark) for personalised respiratory exercise in any rheumatic disease.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the infectious germ most commonly associated with lactation mastitis. Twenty percent of the general population are carriers of Staphylococcus aureus, which means that they carry the infectious germ but do not become ill from it. It has been suggested that mothers who are carriers of S. aureus in their nostril may be at an increased risk of developing lactational mastitis, however; this has not been clinical proven.

We are studying the relationship between S. aureus carrier status of breastfeeding mothers and infants and the risk of developing lactational mastitis.

Researchers have identified a number of devices that can be used to reinforce the surgical repair and enhance the structure and function of both the muscles and tendons (Jo et al., 2011; Randelli, Arrigoni, Ragone, MEng, Aliprandi, Cabitza, 2011; Proctor, 2014). Reinforcement patches have been used to help improve surgical outcomes, including: allograft rotator cuff, human cadaveric skin, pig and bovine skin, equine pericardium, and porcine intestinal submucosa (Randelli, Arrigoni, Ragone, MEng, Aliprandi, Cabitza, 2011). Although synthetic patches have also shown some effectiveness, these patches do not provide biologic augmentation of the tendon repair (Jo et al., 2011).

Additionally, there has been some research examining the effectiveness of using platelet-rich plasma therapy to help repair both rotator cuff tendinopathy and tears. Platelets play an important role in the healing process and it has been theorized that exposing inflamed or healing tissue to higher densities of platelets can contribute to less pain, better range of motion (ROM), and overall healing (Pandey et al., 2016). The consensus on this type of therapy has shown inconclusive results, however. For example, research by Jo et al. (2011) found no significant change in clinical recovery in respect to pain or ROM compared to a control group. Alternatively, Pandey et al. (2016) found significant improvements in both pain and ROM scores as well as decreased re-tear rates in the plasma-rich protein treatment group. These and other similar studies utilized different methodologies for patient populations (tendinopathy versus full tears, etc.), treatment timing, formulation of platelet-rich plasma or whole blood fibrin clot, and time of follow-up. Further research is needed to identify what treatments, if any, in the field of platelet-rich plasma are most beneficial for patients with rotator cuff tears. Recent research has demonstrated that whole blood fibrin clots concentrate 98% of available platelets and release growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor over two weeks (Siegel, Clevenger, Proctor, Clegg, \& Proctor, 2017). However, clinical evidence indicating the effect of whole blood fibrin clots on the healing of repaired torn rotator cuffs is lacking (Jo et al., 2011). The goal of this study is to assess whether undergoing surgical repair of the rotator cuff with the additional intervention of whole blood fibrin clot will improve rotator cuff vascularization at the bone-tendon interface repair site and patient outcomes compared to those who do not receive the whole blood fibrin clot intervention.","Inclusion Criteria:

Yonsei University,OTHER,NCT01145079,A New Strategy Regarding Discontinuation of Dual Antiplatelet,A New Strategy Regarding Discontinuation of Dual Antiplatelet; Real Safety and Efficacy of a 3-month Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Following Zotarolimus-eluting Stents Implantation (RESET Trial),"Drug-eluting stents (DES), markedly reducing the neointimal hyperplasia after stent implantation compared with bare-metal stents (BMS), have improved angiographic and clinical outcomes in the complex lesions and patients with high risks. However, currently, the fatal events related with stent thrombosis still occur and are the major limitation of the use of DES. Especially, late or very late thrombosis after DES implantation is an uncommon but life-threatening fatal complication presented with sudden death or myocardial infarction (MI) causing heart failure. The most powerful predictor for stent thrombosis is the discontinuation of clopidogrel. In consideration of current data regarding stent thrombosis and clinical situation of discontinuation of antiplatelet, zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES) \[Endeavor®, Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA\] might be anticipated to be safer than other DES during the long-term follow-up owing to healthy endothelialization. Endeavor® stent was consists of zotarolimus, thin-strut, cobalt-chromium alloy stent platform (DriverTM stent; Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA), and phosphorylcholine coating. The ENDEAVOR II study demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvement in all of study endpoints, including a 47 percent reduction in the primary endpoint of target vessel failure (TVF). In addition, the ENDEAVOR II trial showed a 0.5 percent rate of stent thrombosis at 30 days - with no late thrombosis beyond 30 days and no late stent malapposition. Because reendothelialization after ZES implantation may occur within 3 months, 3-month dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended in many clinical trials and real world practice. Shorter maintenance of dual antiplatelet therapy might minimize the risk for stent thrombosis in cases of discontinuation of antiplatelet and prevent waste medications and bleeding complications related with dual antiplatelet therapy. However, there have been no non-inferior or superior data of ZES considering all these circumstances. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that ZES with 3-month dual antiplatelet therapy may be safe and beneficial in patients with coronary artery disease during follow-up than other DES, in spite of higher late lumen loss. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will perform a multi-center, randomized, prospective trial aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of the ZES versus other DES in patients with coronary artery disease in real world practice.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

PLP is classified as cramping, burning, shooting, or stabbing pain in the missing limb following an amputation. Current treatments include pharmacological drugs, anesthesia, additional surgery, mirror therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and others. TENS, as usually implemented, has been used to effectively reduce pain in multiple spots of the body, but has shown little effect in reducing phantom limb pain especially long term even with varying the frequency and intensity of the electrical stimulation.

University of Michigan,OTHER,NCT00349479,Increasing Stroke Treatment Through Interventional Change Tactics Study,Clinical Trial to Increase t-PA Use in Stroke Treatment,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate a standardized, system-based, barrier assessment and interactive educational intervention to increase appropriate t-PA use for stroke.","Stroke is a major public health problem. Only 1 to 3 percent of people with stroke patients in community settings are receiving tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy ten years after it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Data from academic stroke teams, stroke patient arrival times, and thrombolytic therapy (clot-dissolving) in myocardial infarction suggest substantially higher treatment rates are possible. The development and implementation of educational interventions to motivate physicians, other healthcare providers, and healthcare organizations, to learn the principles of acute stroke care is a high-priority.

Limited prior work found a combination of community and professional education increased thrombolytic therapy for stroke from a pre-intervention rate of 2.2 percent to a post-intervention rate of 11.3 percent, with the data suggesting the professional education was the critical element for increasing use.

The Increasing Stroke Treatment through Interventional behavioral Change Tactics (INSTINCT) trial is designed to evaluate a standardized, system-based barrier assessment and interactive educational intervention (BA-IEI) for increasing appropriate t-PA use in people with stroke. This multi-center, randomized, controlled study will be conducted at 24 hospital sites nationwide.

The intervention, BA-IEI, targets emergency departments and is based on adult education and behavior change theory. BA-IEI is designed for replication in community health initiatives. It incorporates local stroke champion development, hospital-specific barrier evaluation, mixed CME targeting identified barriers, performance feedback, protocol development, and academic detailing. The primary endpoint will be the increase in appropriate use of t-PA for stroke with evaluations of change in emergency physician knowledge on t-PA use.

The primary aims of this study are to determine if a BA-IEI is effective in increasing appropriate t-PA use in stroke, and if BA-IEI improves emergency physician knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding the use of t-PA for acute stroke.

Results from this study may lead to an effective method for increasing the use of t-PA for stroke.","Inclusion Criteria:

Stroke is a major public health problem. Only 1 to 3 percent of people with stroke patients in community settings are receiving tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy ten years after it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Data from academic stroke teams, stroke patient arrival times, and thrombolytic therapy (clot-dissolving) in myocardial infarction suggest substantially higher treatment rates are possible. The development and implementation of educational interventions to motivate physicians, other healthcare providers, and healthcare organizations, to learn the principles of acute stroke care is a high-priority. Limited prior work found a combination of community and professional education increased thrombolytic therapy for stroke from a pre-intervention rate of 2.2 percent to a post-intervention rate of 11.3 percent, with the data suggesting the professional education was the critical element for increasing use. The Increasing Stroke Treatment through Interventional behavioral Change Tactics (INSTINCT) trial is designed to evaluate a standardized, system-based barrier assessment and interactive educational intervention (BA-IEI) for increasing appropriate t-PA use in people with stroke. This multi-center, randomized, controlled study will be conducted at 24 hospital sites nationwide. The intervention, BA-IEI, targets emergency departments and is based on adult education and behavior change theory. BA-IEI is designed for replication in community health initiatives. It incorporates local stroke champion development, hospital-specific barrier evaluation, mixed CME targeting identified barriers, performance feedback, protocol development, and academic detailing. The primary endpoint will be the increase in appropriate use of t-PA for stroke with evaluations of change in emergency physician knowledge on t-PA use. The primary aims of this study are to determine if a BA-IEI is effective in increasing appropriate t-PA use in stroke, and if BA-IEI improves emergency physician knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding the use of t-PA for acute stroke. Results from this study may lead to an effective method for increasing the use of t-PA for stroke.

Hypothesis: Coronectomy of wisdom tooth can reduce the chance of injury to the inferior alveolar nerve in cases of radiographic proximity to the roots when compared with conventional method of surgical removal of wisdom teeth, and there is no difference in other surgical morbidities.","Complications of impacted wisdom teeth, such as pericoronitis, caries and periodontal disease are common, and these contribute to the indications that third molar surgery is still the most common oral surgical procedure performed. Damages to the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) during surgical removal of deeply impacted wisdom teeth is a well-known complication. Over the years, reports of IAN deficit after wisdom teeth surgery were recorded from 0.4% to 8.4%. Injury to IAN can be due to compression of the nerve, either by indirect force transmitted by the root during elevation or directly by elevators. It is also possible for the nerve to be transected causing neurotmesis by rotary instruments or when the tooth is grooved or perforated by IAN. Several studies have tried to correlate radiographic markers and relationship of IAN and the root of wisdom teeth. Howe and Poyton identified 3 radiographical signs that the roots of wisdom teeth maybe grooved, notched, or perforated by the IAN 2. Rood and Shehab in 1990 suggested diversion of the canal, darkening of the root and interruption of the white line of IAN to be significantly related to IAN injury. Sedaghatfar et al. in 2005 performed a retrospective cohort study and confirmed that, and adding to it narrowing of the root to be an additional significant sign to predict the proximity of nerve and root. These radiographic signs only indicate to surgeons and patients that there is an increased risk of nerve damage associated with the removal of the corresponding wisdom tooth, but not a prevention to it if the tooth is being removed.

Coronectomy is a procedure intentionally aiming to remove only the crown of an impacted mandibular third molar, leaving the root undisturbed, and thus avoiding possible direct or indirect damage to the IAN.

The group undergoing extraction was found to be significantly more common in experiencing IAN deficit after surgery than the coronectomy group, while no significant differences could be concluded in terms of other surgical morbidities. The other studies also drew similar conclusions. One common finding, however, was the slow superficial migration of the wisdom tooth root after coronectomy.

Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla,OTHER,NCT04011579,Pilates Training in Multiple Sclerosis,Multiple Sclerosis Fitness Intervention Training With Pilates Exercises,"To date, despite recent advances in MS care including rehabilitation interventions, many PwMS are unable to access these developments due to limited mobility, fatigue and related issues, and costs associated with travel.

Thus, physical activity at home could be a new way to deliver exercises to the patients. Although Pilates did not show any significant advantage over standardized physical therapy in the current literature, it is a good method to promote physical activity, sensorimotor integration and cognitive stimulation. Thus, it could be a treatment option to improve fatigue, balance and walking abilities in PwMS; consequently, Pilates could be suggested by the clinician as a physical activity to be integrated in the daily life.

This possibility could be made more feasible using new tools such as those offered by low cost devices.

The main MS-FIT project purposes are to provide and to test a tool based on serious game concept of Pilates-inspired exercises for daily use at home, by mixing the entertainment aspects typical of the videogames and the possibility to perform physical activity.

The MS-FIT tool does not pursue therapeutic aims as rehabilitation does, but it could have a positive impact on prevention and health in MS.

MS-FIT, by using the Microsoft Kinect Motion Controller Xbox or similar to deliver adapted physical activity, offers the possibility to transform the Pilates exercises into a virtual reality game.

MS-FIT, through a multicentre approach, would provide:

* a feasibility study in order to:

  * refine the tool for the final customized version to be used in a RCT MS study
  * assess the tool for PwMS in terms of technology acceptability and satisfaction-to-use
  * assess the process of recruitment, the adherence to the intervention, the dropout rate and identify potential issues
  * assess human resources necessary for the RCT
  * estimate the effect of the intervention and its variance necessary to calculate the appropriate sample size for the RCT
* a RCT study in order to evaluate the effect of a physical activity intervention of exercises inspired to Pilates self-managed at home in terms on PwMS","Devices and technologies for at-home interventions could provide to PwMS with mild disability useful tools to successfully maintain own physical, cognitive and emotional status by performing at-home physical activity/exercises and avoiding outpatient interventions. Together, new devices and technologies could help in overcoming all barriers (i.e. transportations, working time, etc.) hindering the adherence to and, consequently, efficacy of the outpatient treatments.

MS-FIT, through a multicentre approach, would provide:

* Feasibility study
* RCT study

All the 14 participating centres will select a dedicated therapist who will be responsible for patient training in using the MS-FIT tool.

All the subjects recruited following the inclusion/exclusion criteria will sign an informed consent and all the procedures (feasibility and RCT) will be in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and approved by Local Ethical Committee.

No trial-specific procedures will be conducted before informed consent has been obtained, and participants will be reminded that they may withdraw from the trial at any time without it affecting the quality of their care in the future.

Participants with relapses during the period of their involvement in the project will be considered as drop out and will be considered in the analysis for the entire period of study participation.

Feasibility study

Primary objective:

• the refinement of the tool for the final customized version to be used in a RCT MS study. The primary objective will be reached by fixing eventual bugs relieved during the feasibility study and taking into account results from the assessment in terms of technology acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety and the physical effects of the intervention.

Secondary Objectives:

* the estimation of human resources necessary for the RCT.
* the estimation of the effect of the intervention and its variance necessary to calculate the appropriate sample size for the RCT.

Due to the nature of the feasibility study and based on previous literature showing that a sample size of 25-40 subjects per arm is adequate for a feasibility trial, the investigators will recruit 28 PwMS per arm. All the 14 participating centres will recruit a total of 56 recruited patients following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the range of EDSS inclusion criteria 28 subjects will be recruited with lower disability (EDSS 2-3) and 28 with higher disability (EDSS of 3.5 or 4). For both levels the subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITFeas (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLFeas (""unspecific physical activities""). Randomization will be provided by an independent randomization service at FISM accessed via a web-based system, using computer-based block randomization (1 factor: EDSS score 2-3 and 3.5-4). Patient will be allocated to MSFITFeas and CTRLFeas in a 1:1 ratio. Confirmation emails will be sent to Centres PI.

The MSFITFeas group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 6 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 6 weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 6 weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home.

The protocol for the Feasibility study will consist on (Figure 2):

* T0 evaluation (PRE)
* 6 weeks of intervention

  * MSFITFeas: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home
  * CTRLFeas: unspecific physical activities
* T1 evaluation (POST)

The evaluation for the Feasibility study are described in the section Outcome Measures.

Deliverables Deliverables of the Feasibility study will be the final customized tool, a set of indications for the management of the RCT, the sample size estimation for the RCT.

Focus group A nested qualitative study on 14 participants will explore patients' experiences of MS-FIT via Focus Group Meeting (FGM). The objectives are to provide insight into the quantitative results, explore strengths and limitations of the intervention with MS-FIT, so as to guide the RCT.

The report of each FGM analysis will be submitted to FGM participants for review (respondent validation).

Deliverables Deliverables of the nested qualitative study will be the delivery of the report of the FGM analysis.

RCT study

Primary Objective:

• evaluation of the change in TUG.

Secondary Objectives:

* evaluation of the physical effects also in terms of self-reported outcome, upper limb performances, resistance in walking and physical activity, cognitive and psychosocial effects, quality of life and wellbeing. Differences in physical and cognitive performances due to the genetic features will be evaluated also considering subgroups identified through the polymorphism analysis.
* evaluation of the acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety through the measurements of endpoint already listed for the Feasibility study.

The RCT sample size will be definitively calculated based on the results from the feasibility study. However, by considering the literature about Pilates in MS, the investigators can preliminary estimate the needed sample size. In particular, the investigators refer to the TUG post-intervention improvement found by Karlon et al. in a group of PwMS performing Pilates. For our aim, the investigators can consider this result even if no differences between Pilates group and control group (Physiotherapy) were found. Pilates group improved the performance in TUG of about 1.8s, that could be considered as clinically relevant for PwMS. By considering a variability of about 3.4s, a power of 80%, a level of significance (two sided) of 5% and a potential loss of 15% of patients at follow-up, the estimation of the necessary sample size consists of approximately 63 subjects for the experimental group (a total of 126).

All the 14 participating centres will be involved in the patients' enrolment. The subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITRCT (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLRCT (""unspecific physical activities""). The randomization will be carried out using a web based procedure and will be centrally managed. A stratified minimization/adaptive algorithm will be used in order to balance the baseline EDSS (2-3 vs 3.5-4) factors across the two groups.

The MSFITRCT group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 12 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. The follow-up (FU) evaluation will be after 6 weeks since the end of the intervention. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home.

At the end of the 18 weeks, the participants of the CTRLRCT group will be offered the MS-FIT intervention.

The requirement that the enrolled patients will have not to perform any supervised physical activity or rehabilitative intervention is in line with recent studies showing that most of PwMS with mild disability (78.34% EDSS \<4) were not treated with rehabilitation.

The subjects involved in the feasibility study will be excluded from the RCT study in order to avoid bias effects.

The protocol design for the RCT study will consist on (Figure 3):

* T0 evaluation (PRE)
* 12 weeks of intervention

  * MSFITRCT: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home
  * CTRLRCT: unspecific physical activities
* T1 evaluation (POST)
* T2 evaluation (FU) - after 6 weeks from T1

The evaluation for the RCT study are described in the section Outcome Measures. Moreover, blood samples will be collected at T0 to investigate if genetic polymorphisms of candidate regulators of neuronal plasticity could be correlated to the response to the proposed protocol. According to previous report MS subjects of the two RCT groups could be subdivided in subgroups with respect to the polymorphism features. For example, for the CNR1 gene the subdivision could be based on the number of AAT repetitions (short AAT: homozygous or heterozygous for allele with ≤11 repeats of AAT triplets; long AAT: homozygous for allele with ≥12 repeats of AAT triplets).

Differences among subgroups in terms of physical and cognitive performances will be evaluated.

In particular, all patients will be genotyped for a total of 55 genetic polymorphisms of 23 potential regulators, like: Homer1; AKT1; RAPTOR; D2R; GAPD; CHAT; p53; BRCA2; LIG4; XRCC5; CYP3A4; NBS1; MDM2; CNR1, ATTn; CNR2; GRIN1; GRIN2B; TRPV1; FAAH, COMPT; (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) BDNF.

Blood sample will be assessed from participants early in the morning after awakening (8h). To synchronize the sample for lifestyle variables, subjects were requested to avoid excessive physical activity the last three days before the blood sampling, sleep for 7-8h the night before study, avoid starving, and eat a usual breakfast in the morning (approximately 1h before the time of the breakfast).

The samples will be collected by each participant centre and shipped to the IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia (Prof. Diego Centonze) for the analyses.

Deliverables Deliverables will be the report of the results of the trial and the final guidelines to make available and easy-to-use the MS-FIT tool

Secondary Objectives: * evaluation of the physical effects also in terms of self-reported outcome, upper limb performances, resistance in walking and physical activity, cognitive and psychosocial effects, quality of life and wellbeing. Differences in physical and cognitive performances due to the genetic features will be evaluated also considering subgroups identified through the polymorphism analysis. * evaluation of the acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety through the measurements of endpoint already listed for the Feasibility study. The RCT sample size will be definitively calculated based on the results from the feasibility study. However, by considering the literature about Pilates in MS, the investigators can preliminary estimate the needed sample size. In particular, the investigators refer to the TUG post-intervention improvement found by Karlon et al. in a group of PwMS performing Pilates. For our aim, the investigators can consider this result even if no differences between Pilates group and control group (Physiotherapy) were found. Pilates group improved the performance in TUG of about 1.8s, that could be considered as clinically relevant for PwMS. By considering a variability of about 3.4s, a power of 80%, a level of significance (two sided) of 5% and a potential loss of 15% of patients at follow-up, the estimation of the necessary sample size consists of approximately 63 subjects for the experimental group (a total of 126). All the 14 participating centres will be involved in the patients' enrolment. The subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITRCT (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLRCT (""unspecific physical activities""). The randomization will be carried out using a web based procedure and will be centrally managed. A stratified minimization/adaptive algorithm will be used in order to balance the baseline EDSS (2-3 vs 3.5-4) factors across the two groups. The MSFITRCT group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 12 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. The follow-up (FU) evaluation will be after 6 weeks since the end of the intervention. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home. At the end of the 18 weeks, the participants of the CTRLRCT group will be offered the MS-FIT intervention. The requirement that the enrolled patients will have not to perform any supervised physical activity or rehabilitative intervention is in line with recent studies showing that most of PwMS with mild disability (78.34% EDSS \<4) were not treated with rehabilitation. The subjects involved in the feasibility study will be excluded from the RCT study in order to avoid bias effects. The protocol design for the RCT study will consist on (Figure 3): * T0 evaluation (PRE) * 12 weeks of intervention * MSFITRCT: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home * CTRLRCT: unspecific physical activities * T1 evaluation (POST) * T2 evaluation (FU) - after 6 weeks from T1 The evaluation for the RCT study are described in the section Outcome Measures. Moreover, blood samples will be collected at T0 to investigate if genetic polymorphisms of candidate regulators of neuronal plasticity could be correlated to the response to the proposed protocol. According to previous report MS subjects of the two RCT groups could be subdivided in subgroups with respect to the polymorphism features. For example, for the CNR1 gene the subdivision could be based on the number of AAT repetitions (short AAT: homozygous or heterozygous for allele with ≤11 repeats of AAT triplets; long AAT: homozygous for allele with ≥12 repeats of AAT triplets). Differences among subgroups in terms of physical and cognitive performances will be evaluated. In particular, all patients will be genotyped for a total of 55 genetic polymorphisms of 23 potential regulators, like: Homer1; AKT1; RAPTOR; D2R; GAPD; CHAT; p53; BRCA2; LIG4; XRCC5; CYP3A4; NBS1; MDM2; CNR1, ATTn; CNR2; GRIN1; GRIN2B; TRPV1; FAAH, COMPT; (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) BDNF. Blood sample will be assessed from participants early in the morning after awakening (8h). To synchronize the sample for lifestyle variables, subjects were requested to avoid excessive physical activity the last three days before the blood sampling, sleep for 7-8h the night before study, avoid starving, and eat a usual breakfast in the morning (approximately 1h before the time of the breakfast). The samples will be collected by each participant centre and shipped to the IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia (Prof. Diego Centonze) for the analyses. Deliverables Deliverables will be the report of the results of the trial and the final guidelines to make available and easy-to-use the MS-FIT tool Criteria for Premature Withdrawal Criteria for the premature withdrawal are: 1. Patients withdrawal of the consent anytime; 2. Any medical conditions that the investigator determines jeopardize the patient's safety if she/he continues the study and/or study results; 3.

University of Virginia,OTHER,NCT02508779,BGAT (Blood Glucose Awareness Training) for Users Who Might Become Pregnant,Blood Glucose Training for Women With Type 1 Diabetes Contemplating Pregnancy,"Ineffective management of blood glucose (BG) levels during preconception and pregnancy has been associated with severe maternal and fetal complications in women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Preconception care emphasizing stringent glycemic control in the preconception period and continued through early pregnancy can dramatically reduce these risks. However, the use of preconception care in the US has been disappointingly low due to a variety of organizational, provider, and patient centered factors. Furthermore, efforts to achieve tight glycemic control can increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH) in T1DM women, potentially leading to serious health consequences. In this project, the investigators will test an education based Internet intervention (Bump2be or Blood glucose awareness training (BGAT) for users who might become pregnant) for use with T1DM women who are either actively trying to become pregnant (TP) or planning to become pregnant in the 12 months following their enrollment in this study (PP).

The main objective is to examine Bump2be's feasibility and preliminary efficacy as an intervention for these women to better regulate their BG levels and to meet their diabetes-related clinical targets for pregnancy. More specifically, Bump2be will be tested in a randomized clinical trial in which 58 T1DM women who are either TP or PP will be recruited. As part of this pre-post study design, participants will be randomly assigned to either the Bump2be intervention (n=29) or the routine care group (n=29). Data collected will include frequency of extreme BG, consequences of extreme BG, average BG levels (HbA1c level), estimation of BG, detection of low and high BG, and psychological functioning (including fear of hypoglycemia, avoidance of hyperglycemia, well-being, and internal locus of control). Interviews with up to 10 trial participants will be conducted at the conclusion of their study participation, to enable further optimization of the intervention in preparation for a subsequent R01 submission. This will be the first study investigating the use of the Internet to improve detection and management of extreme BG levels in Diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) women who are either TP or PP.","Scientific Background: The number of women with type 1 diabetes is expected to rise, particularly for those in their early reproductive years. Pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy can increase the risk of various maternal (e.g., hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis) and fetal complications. Uncontrolled BG levels immediately before and during pregnancy have been associated with miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, infant mortality and a twofold to fourfold increased risk of major congenital malformations. Maternal hyperglycemia has been shown to complicate pregnancy more than any other factor and has been associated with a higher rate of spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations. Preconception care emphasizing stringent BG control in the preconception period (at least three to six months prior to pregnancy) and continued throughout can significantly reduce these risks to levels that are similar to those reported for the non-diabetic population. These attempts to achieve tighter BG control have, however, been linked to increased incidence of SH in early pregnancy. These findings point to the critical importance of providing TIDM women with practical self-management skills that they can actively use to better manage their BG levels, and achieve their target glycemic control without undue risk of hypoglycemia in preparation for pregnancy. At present, however, there are no published behavioral interventions specifically tailored to improving detection and management of extreme BG levels in this patient population.

Rationale: The overall aim of this research is to develop (Phase 1) and test (Phase 2) the feasibility of the Bump2be Internet intervention for use with Diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) women who are either TP or PP to help them effectively detect and reduce occurrences of extreme BG levels. Phase 1 of this research was submitted and approved by the Institutional Review Board (HSR# 16668) in 2013 and has been completed. The Bump2be intervention is based on BGATHome (Blood Glucose Awareness Training at Home), which is an automated, tailored, Internet delivered, psycho-educational intervention for T1DM patients. BGATHome is based on theories of self-regulation of health behavior, and the training focuses on patients' learning how to use both internal cues (e.g., physical and mood changes) and external cues (e.g., insulin and food action) to improve their BG awareness. It has proven successful in improving patients' glycemic control as well as their abilities to detect, anticipate, avoid, and treat extremes BG levels. Investigators have historically excluded T1DM women who were either pregnant or planning pregnancy from BGAT-related studies given their unique clinical needs and glycemic targets. The investigators now propose to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Bump2be in women with T1DM who are either TP or PP to help them better regulate their BG levels and to meet the diabetes-related clinical targets for and during pregnancy. This protocol covers Phase 2 of this project.

Relevance: There is an urgent need to effectively support Diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) women who are either TP or PP in their efforts to achieve and maintain strict glycemic control without experiencing SH. The investigators propose to test an Internet-based training program (Bump2be.org) to assist these women better anticipate, detect, manage, and prevent extreme BG occurrences to enable them to meet their glycemic goals for pregnancy. If found efficacious, Bump2be will be the first Internet-based behavioral intervention to train and assist these women achieve the recommended glycemic targets without increasing their risk of SH. The program has the potential to impact its target patients on a major public health level by supplementing their preconception care with a conveniently accessible program tailored to their specific needs. It holds promise to improve not only their BG management but also psychosocial functioning (e.g., reduced fear of hypoglycemia, improved diabetes-related quality of life and knowledge) with no additional burden on the healthcare system.","Inclusion Criteria:

Systemic sclerosis is a disease characterized by blood vessel injury, immune system activation and fibrosis. Blood vessel injury is thought to be important early in the disease. Blood vessel complications of systemic sclerosis include Raynaud phenomena, finger and toe ulcers, and pulmonary hypertension. While atorvastatin reduces cholesterol, it is recognized to have many effects beyond cholesterol reduction. These include improvement of blood vessel function and reduction of fibrosis. We hypothesize that treatment with atorvastatin over 16 weeks will improve blood vessel function and Raynaud symptom in patients with early diffuse systemic sclerosis. We hope that by targeting therapy early in the disease we may delay blood vessel changes and improve Raynaud symptoms.","Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem autoimmune illness characterized by vasculopathy, immune system activation and fibrosis of the skin and internal organs.

"University of California, San Francisco",OTHER,NCT02815579,Agricultural Intervention for Food Security and HIV Health Outcomes in Kenya,Agricultural Intervention for Food Security and HIV Health Outcomes in Kenya,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether this multisectoral agricultural and microcredit loan intervention improves food security, prevent antiretroviral treatment failure, and reduce co-morbidities among people living with HIV/AIDS.","Despite major advances in care and treatment for those living with HIV, morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) remains unacceptably high in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), largely due to the parallel challenges of poverty and food insecurity.\[1\] In the Nyanza Region of Kenya, 15.1% of the adult population is infected by HIV,\[2\] and over 50% of the rural population is food insecure, primarily due to unpredictable rainfall and limited irrigation.\[3,4\] The investigators have previously shown that food insecurity delays antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, reduces ART adherence, contributes to worse immunologic and virologic outcomes, and increases morbidity and mortality among PLHIV.\[5-16\] There has been increasing international recognition that improved food security and reduced poverty are essential components for a successful global response to the HIV epidemic.\[17-21\] Yet, to date few studies have systematically evaluated the impacts of sustainable food security interventions on health, economic, and behavioral outcomes among PLHIV. Agricultural interventions, which have potential to raise income and bolster food security, are an important but understudied route through which to sustainably improve nutritional and HIV outcomes in SSA, including Kenya where agriculture accounts for \> 75% of the total workforce, and 51% of the gross domestic product.\[22\]

Building on the investigators successful completion of the pilot intervention trial in Kenya and the investigators collective experience studying structural barriers to HIV care in SSA, the investigators plan to test the hypothesis that a multisectoral agricultural and microcredit loan intervention will improve food security, prevent ART treatment failure, and reduce co-morbidities among PLHIV. The investigators' intervention was co-developed with KickStart, a prominent non-governmental organization (NGO) based in SSA that has introduced a human-powered pump, enabling farmers to grow high yield crops year-round. This technology has reduced food insecurity and poverty for 800,000 users in 22 countries in the subcontinent since 1991.\[23\] The investigators' intervention includes: a) a loan (\~$175) from a well-established Kenyan bank for purchasing agricultural implements and commodities; b) agricultural implements to be purchased with the loan including the KickStart treadle pump, seeds, fertilizers and pesticides; and c) education in financial management and sustainable farming practices occurring in the setting of patient support groups. This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of this intervention with the following specific aims:

Aim 1: To determine the impact of a multisectoral agricultural intervention among HIV-infected farmers on ART on HIV clinical outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to improved viral load suppression (primary outcome) and changes in CD4 cell count, physical health status, WHO stage III/IV disease, and hospitalizations (secondary outcomes) in the intervention arm compared to the control arm.

Aim 2: To understand the pathways through which the multisectoral intervention may improve HIV health outcomes. Using the investigator's theoretical model,\[1,24\] the investigators hypothesize that the intervention will improve food security and household wealth, which in turn will contribute to improved outcomes through nutritional (improved nutritional status measured with Body Mass Index), behavioral (improved ART adherence, and retention in care), and mental health (improved mental health/less depression, improved empowerment) pathways (secondary outcomes).

Aim 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and obtain the information necessary to inform scale-up in Kenya and similar settings in SSA. The investigators will quantify the cost per disability-adjusted life year averted, and identify lessons to inform successful scale-up.

To accomplish Aims 1 \& 2, the investigators will randomize 8 matched pairs of health facilities in the Nyanza Region in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms, and enroll 44 participants per facility (total n=704). All participants will be followed for 2 years. Impacts of the investigator's intervention on primary health outcomes and mediators will be investigated to provide definitive data of direct and indirect intervention effects. To accomplish Aim 3, the investigators will: a) conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis; b) identify the characteristics of individuals most likely to benefit from the intervention (e.g., gender, educational attainment, family size, wealth, risk tolerance, and entrepreneurial ability); and c) perform a mixed-methods process evaluation with study participants, staff, and various stakeholders to determine what worked and did not work to guide future scale-up efforts of the intervention.

The investigator's ultimate goal is to develop and test an intervention to reverse the cycle of food insecurity and HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality in SSA.","Inclusion Criteria:

Despite major advances in care and treatment for those living with HIV, morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) remains unacceptably high in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), largely due to the parallel challenges of poverty and food insecurity.\[1\] In the Nyanza Region of Kenya, 15.1% of the adult population is infected by HIV,\[2\] and over 50% of the rural population is food insecure, primarily due to unpredictable rainfall and limited irrigation.\[3,4\] The investigators have previously shown that food insecurity delays antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, reduces ART adherence, contributes to worse immunologic and virologic outcomes, and increases morbidity and mortality among PLHIV.\[5-16\] There has been increasing international recognition that improved food security and reduced poverty are essential components for a successful global response to the HIV epidemic.\[17-21\] Yet, to date few studies have systematically evaluated the impacts of sustainable food security interventions on health, economic, and behavioral outcomes among PLHIV. Agricultural interventions, which have potential to raise income and bolster food security, are an important but understudied route through which to sustainably improve nutritional and HIV outcomes in SSA, including Kenya where agriculture accounts for \> 75% of the total workforce, and 51% of the gross domestic product.\[22\] Building on the investigators successful completion of the pilot intervention trial in Kenya and the investigators collective experience studying structural barriers to HIV care in SSA, the investigators plan to test the hypothesis that a multisectoral agricultural and microcredit loan intervention will improve food security, prevent ART treatment failure, and reduce co-morbidities among PLHIV. The investigators' intervention was co-developed with KickStart, a prominent non-governmental organization (NGO) based in SSA that has introduced a human-powered pump, enabling farmers to grow high yield crops year-round. This technology has reduced food insecurity and poverty for 800,000 users in 22 countries in the subcontinent since 1991.\[23\] The investigators' intervention includes: a) a loan (\~$175) from a well-established Kenyan bank for purchasing agricultural implements and commodities; b) agricultural implements to be purchased with the loan including the KickStart treadle pump, seeds, fertilizers and pesticides; and c) education in financial management and sustainable farming practices occurring in the setting of patient support groups. This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of this intervention with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To determine the impact of a multisectoral agricultural intervention among HIV-infected farmers on ART on HIV clinical outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to improved viral load suppression (primary outcome) and changes in CD4 cell count, physical health status, WHO stage III/IV disease, and hospitalizations (secondary outcomes) in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. Aim 2: To understand the pathways through which the multisectoral intervention may improve HIV health outcomes. Using the investigator's theoretical model,\[1,24\] the investigators hypothesize that the intervention will improve food security and household wealth, which in turn will contribute to improved outcomes through nutritional (improved nutritional status measured with Body Mass Index), behavioral (improved ART adherence, and retention in care), and mental health (improved mental health/less depression, improved empowerment) pathways (secondary outcomes). Aim 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and obtain the information necessary to inform scale-up in Kenya and similar settings in SSA. The investigators will quantify the cost per disability-adjusted life year averted, and identify lessons to inform successful scale-up. To accomplish Aims 1 \& 2, the investigators will randomize 8 matched pairs of health facilities in the Nyanza Region in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms, and enroll 44 participants per facility (total n=704). All participants will be followed for 2 years. Impacts of the investigator's intervention on primary health outcomes and mediators will be investigated to provide definitive data of direct and indirect intervention effects. To accomplish Aim 3, the investigators will: a) conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis; b) identify the characteristics of individuals most likely to benefit from the intervention (e.g., gender, educational attainment, family size, wealth, risk tolerance, and entrepreneurial ability); and c) perform a mixed-methods process evaluation with study participants, staff, and various stakeholders to determine what worked and did not work to guide future scale-up efforts of the intervention. The investigator's ultimate goal is to develop and test an intervention to reverse the cycle of food insecurity and HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality in SSA.

The results show a specially designed serious game can better engage local residents by raising their awareness in vector control and proactiveness in dengue prevention. At least 8 out of 10 participants were willing to be vaccinated against dengue if they knew of the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.","Study design: From March to August 2021, a single-centre randomised controlled trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of playing a serious game (intervention) in improving the KAP of participants in vector control and dengue prevention compared to those who viewed a dengue prevention website (control).

Study site: This study was conducted at a regional public primary care clinic (Polyclinic) in Sengkang. Sengkang Polyclinic is located in Sengkang Community Hub, which is an amenity centre in Sengkang, within the North-East region of Singapore. Sengkang is also a residential town, which is the second most populous in the region, being home to 244,600 residents in 2019.

Sample size calculation: To determine the effect of serious game in the literacy level of adults in preventing dengue in Singapore, the sample size was computed based on the study by Nurul Akmar Ghani et al, in which the significant difference in mean and standard deviation of knowledge scores were 14.55 (3.09) and 15.41 (2.75) respectively between the compared groups. To obtain a sample size with 95% confidence level and 80% power for this study, a minimum of 182 participants per group was required. With a possible drop out of 10%, the sample size was increased to 200 per group.

Recruitment and consent process: Recruitment posters, containing registration details of the study, were placed within the clinic's premises from March to August 2021. Adults who were interested to join the study voluntarily could approach the clinical research coordinators (CRCs), who would screen them for eligibility, explained the study intent and procedure to them in a designated room within the study site. The CRCs were trained by the principal investigator to provide adequate information and address relevant concerns or queries from the participants prior to the start of this study. The latter were informed about the purpose and content of the study based on the approved participant information sheet. After clarifying their doubts and queries, every eligible participant endorsed their written informed consent before randomization.

Randomization: The randomization sequence was created by the biostatistician using computer generated random numbers in a 1:1 ratio. Random permuted blocks were used to ensure equal number in each group. The randomization sequence was concealed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes by the principal investigator (PI) at the study site, and stored in a secured location that was accessible only by the research assistants. Blinding was not possible for the participants and the CRCs, as the intervention group would be required to download an application into the mobile phone. Both the biostatistician and PI were not involved in the enrolment or randomization process of participants in this study.

Study procedure: The KAP assessment instrument was adapted from a previous study conducted by Nurul Akmar Ghani et al.

Participants in both groups completed the first (baseline) questionnaire via a secured online platform, Form.sg. Form.sg was used to create online questionnaires that capture classified data for this study. The platform does not store participants' response data in its servers and all responses are sent directly to the study team's dedicated email address.

Participants in the intervention group installed a mobile application, 'Sam's Mozzie Adventure' and were instructed to complete the game within 2 weeks.

Participants in the control group accessed the National Environmental Agency 'Stop Dengue' website and were instructed to complete reading the dengue prevention information within 2 weeks.

Both groups completed the second questionnaire, containing the KAP assessment and a question pertaining to individual's interest to vaccinate against dengue, within 2 weeks after the intervention. In addition, participants in the serious game group evaluated the game with the adapted Systems Usability Score.

Analysis: The knowledge, attitude and practice scores varied from 0-16, 0-15, 0-15 respectively, with a maximum score of 46 points. The highest achievement attained by the participants in serious game group were measured by the number of stars awarded in-game, which varied from 0-48 stars. The data were audited and errors were rectified before analyses. Descriptive statistics in terms of frequency (n), percentage (%), mean and standard deviations (SD) were used to express the data. The socio-demographic variables between the two groups were compared using Chi-Square test for categorical variables and independent t-test for continuous variables. Independent t-test was used to compare the baseline, follow up and change in KAP scores between the control and intervention group. Paired t-test was used to determine the difference in scores from baseline and follow up. The Spearman's correlation was used to determine the association between change scores and maximum game stars awarded in the intervention group. SUS score was presented in frequency and percentages.

"Intermountain Health Care, Inc.",OTHER,NCT03245879,Antibiotic Stewardship in Small Hospitals,Impact of Implementing Antibiotic Stewardship Programs in 15 Small Hospitals: A Cluster-Randomized Trial Intervention,"Core elements of effective antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) have been identified and evidence-based guidelines have been developed for implementation. The majority of the evidence used for these guidelines are from published studies on the effectiveness of ASPs in large academic or large community hospitals. A significant portion of healthcare in the United States, however, takes place in small hospitals. In 2015, 73% of US hospitals had \< 200 beds (4,057 hospitals) and accounted for 29% of all US inpatient bed days. Limited studies on the effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship implementation have been performed in hospitals with \< 200 beds. Antibiotic use rates and selection patterns in these small hospitals are similar to that of large hospitals and the majority of small hospitals lack formal ASP that meet the CDC's core elements. The objective of this real-world implementation study was to assess the effectiveness of three ASP strategies of escalating intensity designed specifically for small hospitals within a vertically integrated healthcare delivery system.","The investigators designed a clustered randomized controlled intervention to evaluate 3 antibiotic stewardship strategies designed for small hospitals. Each hospital was randomized to one of three ASP interventions with increasing levels of intensity and intervention (Programs 1, 2, 3). The investigators felt that clinical equipoise about the effect of ASPs did not exist and randomizing to a no-intervention group was unacceptable. Antibiotic use was compared within each group before and after the intervention. In keeping with other real-world implementation studies, secondary analyses were planned to include an interrupted time series design to evaluate the impact of each strategy. Randomization of hospitals was stratified based on patient volume. Hospital administration and clinical leadership were not blinded to which ASP program they were randomly assigned to, but there were no public announcements. The intervention started March 2014 and ended June 2015.","Inclusion Criteria:

The majority of the evidence used for these guidelines are from published studies on the effectiveness of ASPs in large academic or large community hospitals. A significant portion of healthcare in the United States, however, takes place in small hospitals. In 2015, 73% of US hospitals had \< 200 beds (4,057 hospitals) and accounted for 29% of all US inpatient bed days. Limited studies on the effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship implementation have been performed in hospitals with \< 200 beds. Antibiotic use rates and selection patterns in these small hospitals are similar to that of large hospitals and the majority of small hospitals lack formal ASP that meet the CDC's core elements. The objective of this real-world implementation study was to assess the effectiveness of three ASP strategies of escalating intensity designed specifically for small hospitals within a vertically integrated healthcare delivery system. The investigators designed a clustered randomized controlled intervention to evaluate 3 antibiotic stewardship strategies designed for small hospitals. Each hospital was randomized to one of three ASP interventions with increasing levels of intensity and intervention (Programs 1, 2, 3). The investigators felt that clinical equipoise about the effect of ASPs did not exist and randomizing to a no-intervention group was unacceptable. Antibiotic use was compared within each group before and after the intervention. In keeping with other real-world implementation studies, secondary analyses were planned to include an interrupted time series design to evaluate the impact of each strategy. Randomization of hospitals was stratified based on patient volume. Hospital administration and clinical leadership were not blinded to which ASP program they were randomly assigned to, but there were no public announcements. The intervention started March 2014 and ended June 2015.

Fasa University of Medical Sciences,OTHER,NCT01021579,"Effects of Metformin Plus Simvastatin on Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS): A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study",,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy affecting 6.5%-6.7% of women in reproductive age, and is commonly associated with obesity, menstrual irregularity, insulin resistance (IR), infertility, and clinical hyperandrogenism and/or hyperandrogenemia (1,2). PCOS is also associated with increased risk of abnormal lipoproteins and hypertension, as well as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular morbidity (3). The lipid and lipoprotein profile in androgenized women with poly cystic ovaries is similar to the made pattern with higher levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and this abnormal pattern is independent of body weight (4). Insulin resistance is associated with reproductive abnormalities in women with PCOS. Improving insulin sensitivity through both lifestyle and pharmacological intervention can ameliorate these abnormalities. Insulin resistance in women with PCOS is common (up to 50%), both in obese and nonobese women (5), and disordered insulin action precedes the increase in androgen.

Treatment for PCOS subjects typically includes, implementation of lifestyle changes especially weight loss and adjuvant pharmaceutical intervention including oral contraceptives, anti-androgen therapy and insulin-lowering drugs (such as, metformin) (6). Metformin is a biguanide used extensively in type 2 diabetes. It inhibits hepatic glucose production and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity, but dose not cause hypoglycemia. Several studies have shown an increase in insulin sensitivity and pregnancy rate accompanied by decreased insulin and androgen levels in PCOS patients taking metformin (7).

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-COA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, and inhibition of this enzyme decreases cholesterol synthesis and a compensatory increase in the expression of LDL receptors in the liver. Statins reduce plasma triglycerides in dose-dependent fashion and also have a modest HDL-raising effect which is not dose-dependent (8,9). Furthermore, statins pose other cardio-protective properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions (10,11).

Some studies have reported that simvastatin decreases serum androgen levels in women with PCOS (12,13) by inhibiting proliferation and steroidogenesis of ovarian theca-interstitial cells (14). According to these previous findings, we hypothesized that combination therapy with simvastatin and metformin will result in lower androgen levels and cardiovascular risk factors in women with PCOS.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

It can occur in those with mild disease or asymptomatic patients. Most commonly reported symptoms of Long Covid are:

* Tiredness or fatigue
* Difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as ""brain fog"")
* Headache
* Loss of smell or taste
* Dizziness on standing
* Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)
* Chest pain
* Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
* Cough
* Joint or muscle pain
* Depression or anxiety
* Fever
* Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental activities

To this date, nearly 180 million people have been infected with Covid19 and over 3 million have lost their lives worldwide. The increasing prevalence of patients with Long Covid symptoms and the lack of effective solutions to address their condition, creates an urgent need for non-pharmacological interventions that are effective and scalable and can be delivered online to accommodate for the limitations due to the Covid pandemic.

Yogic Breathing and Meditation techniques have been shown to have various health benefits including improving pulmonary function and mental health. Prominent health institutions are recommending breathing exercise to their Covid patients to assist their respiratory recovery9. Meditation and breathing is also shown to help with Covid related stress and anxiety.

This study is a waitlisted randomized controlled trial conducted in 2 phases:

Phase 1: If participants are in the intervention group, they will be asked to learn and practices two Yogic Breathing practices (Simha Kriya and Nadi Shuddhi) and a guided meditation (Isha Kriya) for 3 weeks They will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires at baseline and the end of each week. Participants in the waitlisted control group will be asked to perform their regular daily routine as they wait to be enrolled into the intervention at the end of 3 weeks.

Surgical treatment of pulmonary artery sling with tracheal stenosis has a high risk and a relatively poor prognosis. This article aims to explore the relationship between the index of tracheal and left pulmonary artery stenosis and the surgical effect of pulmonary artery sling with tracheal stenosis. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the cases of pulmonary artery sling surgery in our center from January 2010 to December 2018. Before operation, routine cardiac enhancement CT examination was performed, and the diameter of the left pulmonary artery and the tracheal stenosis were measured on the CT tomogram respectively, and the ratio of the degree of tracheal stenosis / left pulmonary artery stenosis (T / P) was calculated, combining the surgical method and clinical prognosis analyzed and discussed.","Pulmonary artery sling is a rare congenital pulmonary vascular malformation. The abnormality of the left pulmonary artery originates from the right pulmonary artery instead of the trunk of the pulmonary artery. It passes around the trachea, passes between the trachea and the esophagus, and forms a vascular ring with the arterial ligament. Compression of the trachea and esophagus, especially the symptoms of tracheal stenosis caused by the compression of the trachea, can be manifested as serious symptoms such as respiratory infections, wheezing, and even respiratory distress, which can be life-threatening in severe cases. Therefore, the key to the surgical treatment of pulmonary artery sling is to relieve tracheal compression and correct tracheal stenosis, which is also the difficulty. At present, the overall survival rate of surgical treatment of pulmonary artery sling around the world is about 78% to 93% \[1\], but the mortality rate for patients with severe tracheal stenosis is also high, reaching about 24% \[1\], mainly due to pre-operative or post-operative respiratory failure caused by narrowed trachea. At present, the selection and intervention of pulmonary artery sling combined with tracheal stenosis is still a difficult problem. On the one hand, if tracheoplasty is performed, anastomotic scar hyperplasia after surgery may lead to local tracheal stenosis again \[2\], and long-term care is also quite difficult; If tracheoplasty is not performed, tracheal stenosis may not be completely relieved, and obstructive ventilation disorder and respiratory failure may occur after surgery \[1\]. At present, there is basically no objection to the preoperative assessment methods of pulmonary artery sling. CCTA is generally considered to be an effective method for diagnosing pulmonary artery sling with tracheal stenosis. It can display abnormally deformed pulmonary arteries and narrowed trachea, and it can also detect intracardiac malformations. The important means of preoperative evaluation can also be used for postoperative evaluation \[3\].

There is currently no consensus on the indications for tracheal intervention with pulmonary artery sling combined with tracheal stenosis. Some researchers believe that tracheoplasty should be performed for tracheal diameters less than 3mm, or the prognosis is poor \[4\]. Some researchers have suggested that the diameter / length percentage of tracheal stenosis can be used as a reference index for intervention of tracheal stenosis \[5\]. Brouns et al. found that the square of the cross-sectional area of the tracheal stenosis has a significant proportional relationship with the air flow, so they believe that the cross-sectional area of the tracheal stenosis is the main factor affecting the ventilation effect \[6\]. When I reviewed the imaging data of children with tracheal stenosis in our center, the most severe tracheal stenosis is usually located in the vascular ring formed by the right pulmonary artery starting segment, the left pulmonary artery starting segment, and the left pulmonary artery bypass segment. Not only was the trachea compressed and significantly narrowed, but the left pulmonary artery was also significantly narrowed, that is, the trachea and the left pulmonary artery were squeezed together in a limited space, causing both of them to be compressed and narrowed. This study was the first to investigate the interaction and morphological changes of the trachea and the left pulmonary artery, and the ratio of the degree of tracheal stenosis / left pulmonary artery stenosis (T / P) was used to indicate the degree of interaction between the two. A larger T / P ratio indicates that the left pulmonary artery is more dominant in tracheal compression, and tracheal stenosis is usually more serious. On the contrary, a smaller T / P ratio indicates that the trachea is more dominant in compression of the left pulmonary artery, and the tracheal stenosis is usually relatively lighter.

Although the exact physiopathology of PCOS remains unknown, several studies tend to point to insulinoresistance (IR) as the cause of the syndrome. IR is present in 60 to 70% of patients independently of obesity. Compensatory hyperinsulinism has a pivotal role in the physiopathogenesis of PCOS. In vitro, insulin stimulates androgen synthesis in thecal cells and decrease sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis in the liver, increasing free androgen availability.

Due to the high prevalence of IR, PCOS shares components of metabolic syndrome: abdominal obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational and type 2 diabetes, abnormalities in lipid profile, blood hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and probably cardiovascular disease.

In the past, PCOS treatment was focus on ovulation induction for infertility, oral contraceptives for irregular bleeding, and androgens antagonists for hirsutism or acne. In later years insulin sensitizing agents have been used to reduce hyperinsulinemia, improve ovary function and associated metabolic abnormalities. Metformin (MTF), a biguanide, usually used in obese patients with type 2 diabetes,inhibits glucose hepatic production,decreases insulin secretion and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity.

Some studies have reported an improvement in insulin sensitivity associated with reduction of hyperandrogenism and improvements in reproductive abnormalities with MTF. On the other hand, other authors failed to observe those changes. However, an off label indication for it usage in PCOS for FDA and the lack of large controlled trials, MTF indication to treat PCOS has grown dramatically in later years.

In obese women with PCOS, weight loss effectively ameliorates hyperandrogenism and metabolic disorders by improving insulin resistance.

Some trials have suggested that those effects could be improved with insulin sensitizing agents without changes in body weigh.

The present study was designed to assess, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled way, the effects of MTF in addition to lifestyle modifications on endocrine and metabolic disturbances in women with PCOS.","Inclusion Criteria:

- WHIMS (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis Syndrome) is a rare disease. It can cause cancers, infections, and warts. Researchers want to see if a drug called plerixafor can treat WHIMS.

Objective:

- To compare plerixafor versus granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for preventing infections in people with WHIMS.

Eligibility:

- People ages 10-75 with WHIMS who have a CXCR4 gene mutation.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. They may have heart and spleen tests and body scans. They may have samples of skin or warts taken. Researchers may take photographs of warts.
* Participants will start twice daily self-injections of G-CSF. Their doctors will decide the dosage.
* Initial Period (4-12 weeks)
* Participants will:
* continue the injections and their usual antibiotics and/or immunoglobulin
* have blood drawn
* keep a daily health diary
* Participants will visit the clinic for 2 days without injections.
* Adjustment Period 1 (8 weeks):
* Participants will:
* continue twice daily injections from home
* continue the daily health diary
* have blood tests every 2 weeks.
* Treatment Year 1:
* Participants will
* receive either plerixafor or G-CSF injections twice daily
* continue the health diary
* have blood tests every 2 months
* visit the clinic about every 4 months
* At the end of year 1, participants will visit the clinic for an evaluation. They will switch to the other study drug. They will have an 8-week adjustment and 1-year treatment period.
* At the end of year 2, participants will visit the clinic to complete their injections and go back to their previous G-CSF regimen. Participants will continue their daily health diary and have blood tests for 5-6 months.","Warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome (WHIMS) is a rare combined primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in the gene for the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Normally, CXCR4 is expressed on most leukocyte subsets and functions in part to promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and neutrophil homing to and retention in bone marrow. WHIM mutations alter the CXCR4 carboxyl terminus, which enhances and prolongs receptor signaling. As a result, egress of normally produced and functional neutrophils from the bone marrow to the blood is impaired causing neutropenia, a bone marrow pathologic finding referred to as myelokathexis. A similar mechanism may also affect other leukocyte subsets since WHIM patients usually are panleukopenic. Consequently, WHIM patients are predisposed to frequent acute bacterial infections, especially in the sinopulmonary tract, that may cause chronic morbidity, respiratory insufficiency and in some cases premature death. WHIM patients also have marked difficulty clearing infections with Human Papillomavirus (HPV), resulting in persistent cutaneous and anogenital warts that in several reported cases have evolved into cancer. Several deaths have also occurred due to cancer associated with Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) infection. Therapies currently used for WHIMS are non-specific and expensive, and include Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) (the drug currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat severe congenital neutropenia), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and prophylactic antibiotics. None of these measures has been formally evaluated for efficacy in WHIM syndrome (WHIMS); however, in our clinical experience based on the treatment of 24 WHIM patients seen at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2006, recurrent bacterial infections continue to occur, despite the fact that the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) can be readily maintained above 500 cells/microliter by G-CSF and IgG levels can be restored to the normal range by IVIg. Thus, there continues to be a major unmet medical need for effective therapy in WHIMS despite the availability and application of best therapy for neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia in these patients. Plerixafor (Mozobil ) is a specific small molecule antagonist of CXCR4, licensed by the FDA for HSC mobilization for transplantation in cancer, and is therefore a logical candidate for molecularly targeted treatment of WHIMS. The goal of treatment would be to reduce CXCR4 signaling to normal, not to zero, thus, absent any off-target effects, targeted chronic treatment with this agent may be safe. In this regard, 2 recent short term Phase I dose-escalation studies of plerixafor, one from our group, in a total of 9 patients demonstrated that the drug could safely mobilize not only neutrophils, but also all other leukocyte subsets that are decreased in the blood of WHIM patients. A follow-up Phase I study, conducted by our group, in 3 patients given plerixafor 0.02-0.04 mg/kg/d for 6 months demonstrated that these hematopoietic effects were durable. Moreover, the frequency of infection was reduced on plerixafor as compared to retrospective data mined for the three years before starting therapy and prospective data collected for one year after ending therapy, even though 2 of the patients were taking GCSF during the comparison time periods. No new warts occurred during treatment and several existing warts improved or resolved. Although these results are encouraging, the small number of patients studied, limited duration of drug treatment, and retrospective mining of control data leave open to question whether plerixafor is truly efficacious for clinical outcomes in WHIMS. The randomized, double blinded, crossover trial described here is designed to answer this question by establishing the long-term safety and clinical efficacy (primary endpoint: infection severity; multiple secondary endpoints including wart control) of plerixafor as compared to G-CSF in the treatment of WHIMS patients 10-75 years of age. G-CSF as a comparator is required because of its approved use in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN).

Brief outline of study we intend to randomize 20 patients and treat them in a double-blinded manner for 1 year with G-CSF and 1 year with plerixafor using a crossover design to allow direct comparison of infection severity during treatment with both agents, at doses determined by the patient s individual neutrophil response. A schedule of events has been provided in Appendix A. Data will be analyzed as specified in the Statistics section (Section 14) after randomization. Tolerability and patient drug preference will also be assessed.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Background: - WHIMS (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis Syndrome) is a rare disease. It can cause cancers, infections, and warts. Researchers want to see if a drug called plerixafor can treat WHIMS. Objective: - To compare plerixafor versus granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for preventing infections in people with WHIMS. Eligibility: - People ages 10-75 with WHIMS who have a CXCR4 gene mutation. Design: * Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. They may have heart and spleen tests and body scans. They may have samples of skin or warts taken. Researchers may take photographs of warts. * Participants will start twice daily self-injections of G-CSF. Their doctors will decide the dosage. * Initial Period (4-12 weeks) * Participants will: * continue the injections and their usual antibiotics and/or immunoglobulin * have blood drawn * keep a daily health diary * Participants will visit the clinic for 2 days without injections. * Adjustment Period 1 (8 weeks): * Participants will: * continue twice daily injections from home * continue the daily health diary * have blood tests every 2 weeks. * Treatment Year 1: * Participants will * receive either plerixafor or G-CSF injections twice daily * continue the health diary * have blood tests every 2 months * visit the clinic about every 4 months * At the end of year 1, participants will visit the clinic for an evaluation. They will switch to the other study drug. They will have an 8-week adjustment and 1-year treatment period. * At the end of year 2, participants will visit the clinic to complete their injections and go back to their previous G-CSF regimen. Participants will continue their daily health diary and have blood tests for 5-6 months. Warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome (WHIMS) is a rare combined primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in the gene for the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Normally, CXCR4 is expressed on most leukocyte subsets and functions in part to promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and neutrophil homing to and retention in bone marrow. WHIM mutations alter the CXCR4 carboxyl terminus, which enhances and prolongs receptor signaling. As a result, egress of normally produced and functional neutrophils from the bone marrow to the blood is impaired causing neutropenia, a bone marrow pathologic finding referred to as myelokathexis. A similar mechanism may also affect other leukocyte subsets since WHIM patients usually are panleukopenic. Consequently, WHIM patients are predisposed to frequent acute bacterial infections, especially in the sinopulmonary tract, that may cause chronic morbidity, respiratory insufficiency and in some cases premature death. WHIM patients also have marked difficulty clearing infections with Human Papillomavirus (HPV), resulting in persistent cutaneous and anogenital warts that in several reported cases have evolved into cancer. Several deaths have also occurred due to cancer associated with Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) infection. Therapies currently used for WHIMS are non-specific and expensive, and include Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) (the drug currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat severe congenital neutropenia), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and prophylactic antibiotics. None of these measures has been formally evaluated for efficacy in WHIM syndrome (WHIMS); however, in our clinical experience based on the treatment of 24 WHIM patients seen at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2006, recurrent bacterial infections continue to occur, despite the fact that the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) can be readily maintained above 500 cells/microliter by G-CSF and IgG levels can be restored to the normal range by IVIg. Thus, there continues to be a major unmet medical need for effective therapy in WHIMS despite the availability and application of best therapy for neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia in these patients. Plerixafor (Mozobil ) is a specific small molecule antagonist of CXCR4, licensed by the FDA for HSC mobilization for transplantation in cancer, and is therefore a logical candidate for molecularly targeted treatment of WHIMS. The goal of treatment would be to reduce CXCR4 signaling to normal, not to zero, thus, absent any off-target effects, targeted chronic treatment with this agent may be safe. In this regard, 2 recent short term Phase I dose-escalation studies of plerixafor, one from our group, in a total of 9 patients demonstrated that the drug could safely mobilize not only neutrophils, but also all other leukocyte subsets that are decreased in the blood of WHIM patients. A follow-up Phase I study, conducted by our group, in 3 patients given plerixafor 0.02-0.04 mg/kg/d for 6 months demonstrated that these hematopoietic effects were durable. Moreover, the frequency of infection was reduced on plerixafor as compared to retrospective data mined for the three years before starting therapy and prospective data collected for one year after ending therapy, even though 2 of the patients were taking GCSF during the comparison time periods. No new warts occurred during treatment and several existing warts improved or resolved. Although these results are encouraging, the small number of patients studied, limited duration of drug treatment, and retrospective mining of control data leave open to question whether plerixafor is truly efficacious for clinical outcomes in WHIMS. The randomized, double blinded, crossover trial described here is designed to answer this question by establishing the long-term safety and clinical efficacy (primary endpoint: infection severity; multiple secondary endpoints including wart control) of plerixafor as compared to G-CSF in the treatment of WHIMS patients 10-75 years of age. G-CSF as a comparator is required because of its approved use in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Brief outline of study we intend to randomize 20 patients and treat them in a double-blinded manner for 1 year with G-CSF and 1 year with plerixafor using a crossover design to allow direct comparison of infection severity during treatment with both agents, at doses determined by the patient s individual neutrophil response. A schedule of events has been provided in Appendix A. Data will be analyzed as specified in the Statistics section (Section 14) after randomization. Tolerability and patient drug preference will also be assessed. * INCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects are eligible to enter the study if they meet all of the following criteria: 1.

This issue increases stress for caregivers and contributes to a worsening of their mental health and quality of life. The present study evaluates the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention program aimed at reducing the reluctance of the dependent to attend the ADCC. We hope that reducing resistance will have a positive influence on the mental health of caregivers.","Randomized controlled trial. The protocol was performed in accordance with the SPIRIT 2013 Statement and was registered in the Clinical Trials-gov (PROCENDIAS study). The CONSORT guidelines were rigorously followed in this randomized clinical trial. Information about the study, including the objectives, procedures, possible benefits and risks was provided at the beginning of the study and written informed consent, according to the general recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical, 2013), was obtained from each study participant.

Study Population:

The study was conducted in the municipality of Salamanca based on a list of people who attend an ADCC and whose relatives agree to participate voluntarily in the study. The reference population will be people attending ADCC and the relatives who participate in their care and who identify themselves as principal caregivers for this task.

Variables and measurement instruments The data will be collected in an interview, using the questionnaire designed for the study.

1. Outcome variables:

   Caregiviers:

   Sociodemographic information. The frequency and distress associated with disruptive behaviors was measured with the Spanish version of the disruptive behaviors sub-scale of the Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC), an 8-item scale with answers ranging from 0 (never occurred) to 4 (occurs daily or more often), for the frequency score, and from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), for the distress score.

   Caregivers' mental health as self-perceived by caregivers was measured using the 12-item version of the GHQ-12 (Goldberg \& Hillier, 1979). Depressive symptomatology was measured through the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), a 20-item scale. Caregiver stress and overload were measured through the short Zarit Burden Interview (short ZBI; Gort et al., 2005). Family function has been measured using the family APGAR test (Smilkstein, 1978).

These symptoms are described as positive symptoms, because they are experienced in addition to what healthy individuals experience. Negative symptoms, which are reductions in normal functioning, and cognitive deficits, which are problems in thinking, also plague people with schizophrenia. The negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia are produced in otherwise healthy people by neurotransmitters inhibiting the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate NMDA receptors in the brain.

University of Miami,OTHER,NCT02198079,"A Prospective, Multicenter, Collaborative Study to Determine the Prevalence of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) in Pediatric Patients With Cystic Fibrosis in Florida","A Prospective, Multicenter, Collaborative Study to Determine the Prevalence of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) in Pediatric Patients With Cystic Fibrosis in Florida","To determine the prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (NTM) in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis in the State fo Florida. HYPOTHESIS: There is high prevalence of NTM in CF pediatric population in the State of Florida, and likely higher than in the rest of the country.","Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are a heterogeneous group of organisms that have been increasingly reported in North America 1, 2 and recognized to be a pulmonary pathogen in non immunocompromised persons, in middle age-elderly people, non smoking women, apart from the high risk population with underlying lung disease, and also in Cystic fibrosis (CF) population.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians, a result of mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene. The carrier rate is estimated at 1:25, and 1:3500 live births in Caucasians are affected with CF. A broadening spectrum of mutations of the CFTR gene has been identified in recent years and a widening array of disorders, particularly of the respiratory system, is expected to be associated with some of these genetic abnormalities. The predisposition to specific airway infections may be a feature of some of these mutations as well as many modifying genes that could alter the course of the disease.

The disease predominantly affects the GI tract and the respiratory system. Infectious complications of the latter are the predominant determinants of morbidity and life expectancy in these patients.

Patients with cystic fibrosis are also at high risk of suffering from chronic airway infections, and one of the increasingly identified microorganisms is non-tuberculous mycobacteria. NTM has been shown to be a potential contributor to the decline in lung function, the major determinant of outcome and longevity of these patients.

Since patients with CF have chronic bacterial pulmonary infections as their disease progresses, the clinical signs and symptoms of NTM are often difficult to distinguish from the underlying disease. Such potential underestimation of the contribution of NTM to the decline of lung function in cystic fibrosis may be an added risk to the eventual outcome of these patients. A variety of microorganisms traditionally considered colonizers of the airways, have been increasing in frequency and assuming new clinical significance5, 6, and previously unknown types of known organisms are taking on a new and ominous clinical significance.7 To the practicing clinician NTM appears to be increasing in incidence among the CF population, but the significance of this observation has not been firmly established. The concept of ""colonization,"" defined as the isolation of the organism from the respiratory tract without evidence of tissue invasion, was supported by several investigators in the past, mainly in association with M. avium-complex infection.8, 9 With the emergence of high resolution CT scanning (HRCT), it now appears that many of these patients have features of parenchymal involvement, usually of a nodular pattern, suggesting that the term ""colonization,"" at least in some patients, may be erroneous10, this notion has also been supported by direct bioptic evidence11, indicating the possibility that the full significance of infection with NTM may be underappreciated in patients with CF. It has been proposed that rather than using terminologies such as colonization and active disease, the distinction should be between patients who require immediate therapy on the basis of the rapid progression of their disease and those in whom the decision can be delayed.12 The repeated isolation of the same Mycobacterium from a patient with CF may be indicative of indolent infection and these patients may be at risk of developing clinical symptoms that will ultimately require treatment. This observation is supported by a series of autoptic studies13 indicating that patients with CF who have multiple positive sputum cultures for NTM are more likely to have histologic evidence of granulomatous mycobacterial disease. An additional study11 reports of a patient who had bioptic evidence of granulomas with NTM infection resulting in fulminant disease some 14 years later, suggesting that frank infections may be subclinical for a long period of time. The predictable but variable progression of the lung disease inherent to CF cannot be easily uncoupled from a possible contribution that chronic infection with NTM may add to the slope of such decline. Thus the role of such silent infections in exacerbating the decline of pulmonary function in such patients remains to be elucidated. From the clinical perspective subtle changes on serial high resolution computerized tomography of the chest (HRCT) may enable earlier diagnosis and intervention prior to the development of cavitation and/or irreversible lung damage.10 Of the NTM, Mycobacterium abscessus is a member of the rapidly growing mycobacteria. With improvements in identification, it is now known that this organism accounts for approximately 80% of rapidly-growing mycobacterial respiratory disease isolates.9 Prior to the 1990s, there were few reports of clinically important NTM infection complicating CF of which seven were cases of M. abscessus.11 Although the natural history of this disease can vary, it appears to follow a more fulminant course in patients with underlying lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis.14 The treatment of M. abscessus is complex. The isolates are uniformly resistant to standard antituberculosis drugs and are generally susceptible only to parenteral antibiotics and the newer oral macrolides. The organism is notoriously difficult to eradicate. In a report of 154 patients infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria14, only 10 patients infected with M. abscessus exhibited a ""cure,"" the latter being defined as a return of respiratory symptoms to baseline and reversion of sputum to smear and culture negativity for at least 1 year. It has been noted for many years that the rates of infection and morbidity with and from NTM in non-CF patients have been increasing.1, 9 This notion has been recently supported by a report on the prevalence of mycobacterial infection in Ontario. The prevalence rose significantly (p\<0.001) from 9.1/100,000 in 1997 to 16.5/100,000 in 2002, and 14.2/100,000 in 2003. A coincidental significant (\<0.001) decline in the rate of M. tuberculosis infection from 6.9/100,000 in 1997 to 5.4/100,00 in 2003 was noted15. Whether such a trend of increasing prevalence of NTM also occurs in CF has not been formally addressed in the literature.

A number of studies from the US and Europe addressing the epidemiology of NTM in cystic fibrosis has been published. These studies suggest a large variability in the incidence and the nature of the infecting organisms between various regions of the world, and various institutions. While the clinical impression would support a trend of increasing prevalence of NTM in CF parallel to non-CF patients, the absence of repeated studies and the limitations imposed by the inconsistencies amongst centers and regions, does not allow a firm statement on this subject.

The increasing rates of infection and morbidity from NTM in non-CF patients 1, 2 is likely similarly trending amongst patients with CF. In the US, a 1992 study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 3 revealed a high prevalence of CF patients with NTM infection in the southeastern United States. Of 87 patients studied 17 (19.5%) had at least one positive culture for NTM. A 1993 study was reported from the University of Washington 4 revealing a prevalence of 12.5% amongst their 64 adult patients.

The key publications on prevalence of NTM in patients with CF in the US by Olivier et al5 revealed an overall prevalence of 13%, with the most common organisms in adults being M. avium- complex (MAC).

Data on the prevalence and significance of NTM infections in younger patients with CF are less clear. Several studies suggest that NTM infection in CF pediatric population is low 3-7 but the numbers vary around the globe. A study from Necker Hospital for Sick Children in Paris8 revealed a prevalence of 5 % in children with a mean age of age 11.9 y o (2.5 to 22 y o). It also revealed that M. abscessus was the prevailing organism among the pediatric population, rather than MAC, the commonest organism in adults.

The Olivier studies 5 confirmed that the prevalence of NTM is particularly high in the southeastern USA, as previously suggested by a study from the adult CF center of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 3 that revealed a prevalence of 19.5%. It is therefore of particular interest that a recent pediatric study from the same medical center 9 retrospectively reviewed CF patients younger than 12 years old and found 6.1% overall prevalence of NTM in BALs over 3 years, and 3.9 % using medical record examination over a 10- year period.

This information that is collected will help to deepen the understanding of the nature of the microbiology of our CF pediatric population, and to what extent NTM play a role in the colonization and possible disease causation in this region of the country. The investigators think this role is underestimated. Once the information becomes available, The investigators will be able to make better plans of dealing with this infection.","Inclusion Criteria:

HYPOTHESIS: There is high prevalence of NTM in CF pediatric population in the State of Florida, and likely higher than in the rest of the country. Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are a heterogeneous group of organisms that have been increasingly reported in North America 1, 2 and recognized to be a pulmonary pathogen in non immunocompromised persons, in middle age-elderly people, non smoking women, apart from the high risk population with underlying lung disease, and also in Cystic fibrosis (CF) population. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians, a result of mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene. The carrier rate is estimated at 1:25, and 1:3500 live births in Caucasians are affected with CF. A broadening spectrum of mutations of the CFTR gene has been identified in recent years and a widening array of disorders, particularly of the respiratory system, is expected to be associated with some of these genetic abnormalities. The predisposition to specific airway infections may be a feature of some of these mutations as well as many modifying genes that could alter the course of the disease. The disease predominantly affects the GI tract and the respiratory system. Infectious complications of the latter are the predominant determinants of morbidity and life expectancy in these patients. Patients with cystic fibrosis are also at high risk of suffering from chronic airway infections, and one of the increasingly identified microorganisms is non-tuberculous mycobacteria. NTM has been shown to be a potential contributor to the decline in lung function, the major determinant of outcome and longevity of these patients. Since patients with CF have chronic bacterial pulmonary infections as their disease progresses, the clinical signs and symptoms of NTM are often difficult to distinguish from the underlying disease. Such potential underestimation of the contribution of NTM to the decline of lung function in cystic fibrosis may be an added risk to the eventual outcome of these patients. A variety of microorganisms traditionally considered colonizers of the airways, have been increasing in frequency and assuming new clinical significance5, 6, and previously unknown types of known organisms are taking on a new and ominous clinical significance.7 To the practicing clinician NTM appears to be increasing in incidence among the CF population, but the significance of this observation has not been firmly established. The concept of ""colonization,"" defined as the isolation of the organism from the respiratory tract without evidence of tissue invasion, was supported by several investigators in the past, mainly in association with M. avium-complex infection.8, 9 With the emergence of high resolution CT scanning (HRCT), it now appears that many of these patients have features of parenchymal involvement, usually of a nodular pattern, suggesting that the term ""colonization,"" at least in some patients, may be erroneous10, this notion has also been supported by direct bioptic evidence11, indicating the possibility that the full significance of infection with NTM may be underappreciated in patients with CF. It has been proposed that rather than using terminologies such as colonization and active disease, the distinction should be between patients who require immediate therapy on the basis of the rapid progression of their disease and those in whom the decision can be delayed.12 The repeated isolation of the same Mycobacterium from a patient with CF may be indicative of indolent infection and these patients may be at risk of developing clinical symptoms that will ultimately require treatment. This observation is supported by a series of autoptic studies13 indicating that patients with CF who have multiple positive sputum cultures for NTM are more likely to have histologic evidence of granulomatous mycobacterial disease. An additional study11 reports of a patient who had bioptic evidence of granulomas with NTM infection resulting in fulminant disease some 14 years later, suggesting that frank infections may be subclinical for a long period of time. The predictable but variable progression of the lung disease inherent to CF cannot be easily uncoupled from a possible contribution that chronic infection with NTM may add to the slope of such decline. Thus the role of such silent infections in exacerbating the decline of pulmonary function in such patients remains to be elucidated. From the clinical perspective subtle changes on serial high resolution computerized tomography of the chest (HRCT) may enable earlier diagnosis and intervention prior to the development of cavitation and/or irreversible lung damage.10 Of the NTM, Mycobacterium abscessus is a member of the rapidly growing mycobacteria.

Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,OTHER,NCT02875379,Clinical Comparison of Different Humidification Strategies During Noninvasive Ventilation With Helmet,Clinical Comparison of Different Humidification Strategies During Noninvasive Ventilation With Helmet,"Background. Non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) is among first line treatments of acute respiratory failure. Several interfaces are available for non-invasive ventilation.Despite full face and oronasal masks are more frequently used, some evidence suggests that helmets may optimize patients' comfort and NIV tolerability.

During NIV, humidification strategies (heat and moisture exchangers HME or heated humidifiers HH) may significantly affect patient's comfort and work of breathing.

Despite physiological data suggested heated humidification as the best strategy during NIV with full face masks, no differences were found in a randomized controlled study assessing the effects of HME or HH on a pragmatic clinical outcome.

However, the higher dead space (i.e. 18 L/min) and rebreathing rate observed during helmet NIV make such results not applicable to this particular setting.

The investigators designed a randomized-crossover trial to assess the effect of four humidification strategies during helmet NIV on patients with acute respiratory failure, in terms of comfort, work of breathing and patient-ventilator interaction.

Methods. All awake, collaborative, hypoxemic patients requiring mechanical ventilation will be considered for the enrollment. Hypercapnic patients (i.e.PaCO2\>45 mmHg) will be excluded.

Each enrolled patient will undergo helmet NIV with all the following humidification strategies in a random order. Each period will last 60 minutes.

* Passive humidification, double tube circuit.
* Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher \& Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification chamber temperature 33°C.
* Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher \& Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification chamber temperature 37°C.
* Passive humidification with HME, Y-piece circuit.

Ventilatory settings (Draeger Evita xl or Evita infinity ventilators):

Pressure support ventilation; pressure support=20 cmH20; FiO2 titrated to obtain SpO2 between 92 and 98%; positive end-expiratory pressure=10 cmH2O; maximum inspiratory time 0.9 seconds; inspiratory flow trigger = 2 l/min; expiratory trigger: 30% of the maximum inspiratory flow; pressurization time=0,00 s.

Such settings will be kept unchanged during the whole study period. An oesophageal catheter will be placed and secured to measure oesophageal pressure (Pes) and gastric pressure (Pga) (Nutrivent, Italy): the reliability of the measured pressure will be confirmed with an airway occlusion test during NIV with oronasal mask. Work of breathing will be estimated with the pressure-time product (PTP) of the pleural pressure.

A pneumotachograph (KleisTek) will record flow, airway pressure, Pes and Pga on a dedicated laptop.

At the end of each cycle, the patient will be asked to rate his/her discomfort on a visual analog scale (VAS) modified for ICU patients. The level of dyspnea will be assessed with the Borg dyspnea scale.

The following parameters will be record at the end of each cycle:

Arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2, pH, PCO2, PaO2, SaO2. Airway and esophageal pressure signals will be reviewed offline to detect patient-ventilator asynchronies (ineffective efforts, double cycling, premature cycling, delayed cycling) and asynchrony index (number of asynchrony events divided by the total respiratory rate computed as the sum of the number of ventilator cycles (triggered or not) and of wasted efforts) will be computed. The trigger delay will be also measured. The pressurization and depressurization velocity will be assessed with the PTP airway index 300 and 500 (inspiratory and expiratory), as suggested by Ferrone and coworkers. The work of breathing (WOB) for each breath will be estimated by PTPes.

An hygrometer (Dimar SRL, Italy) will measure and record on a dedicated laptop Helmet temperature, relative and absolute humidity.

Primary endpoints: patient's comfort, work of breathing and asynchrony index.

Sample Sizing:

Given the physiological design of the study, the investigators did not make an a priori sample size and plan to enroll 24 patients.","Background Non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) is among first line treatments of acute respiratory failure. In patients with new-onset respiratory failure, NIV was showed to reduce the rate of complications and the length of ICU stay, as compared to invasive mechanical ventilation\[1\] Several interfaces are available for non-invasive ventilation: full face masks, oronasal masks, nasal prongs and helmets\[2\].

Despite full face and oronasal masks are more frequently used, some evidence suggests that helmets may optimize patients' comfort and NIV tolerability. The helmet allows patients' interaction, speech, feeding and does not limit cough. In addition, skin necrosis, gastric distension, or eye irritation are seldom observed during helmet NIV, while may be consequences of long-term treatments with face masks. \[3\] On the contrary, helmet NIV hampers tidal volume monitoring, is contraindicated in hypercapnic patients and requires specific ventilator settings\[4\]. Lastly, when compared to face masks, helmets may increase the work of breathing and worsen patient-ventilator interaction\[5\]\[6\]\[7\].

During NIV, humidification strategies (heat and moisture exchangers HME or heated humidifiers HH) may significantly affect patient's comfort and work of breathing \[8\]\[9\].

Despite physiological data suggested heated humidification as the best strategy during NIV with full face masks\[8\]\[9\], no differences were found in a randomized controlled study assessing the effects of HME or HH on a pragmatic clinical outcome\[10\].

However, the higher dead space (i.e. 18 L/min) and rebreathing rate observed during helmet NIV make such results not applicable to this particular setting.

One only study assessed the effects of a HH during helmet low-flow continuous positive airway pressure on comfort in healthy volunteers\[11\]. Indeed, patients suffering from acute respiratory failure may behave differently, especially in terms of minute ventilation and maximum inspiratory flow.

A recent bench study identified a better patient-ventilator interaction when helmet NIV was provided through a double tube circuit, as compared to the Y-piece system \[12\]. The investigators designed a randomized-crossover trial to assess the effect of four humidification strategies during helmet NIV on patients with acute respiratory failure, in terms of comfort, work of breathing and patient-ventilator interaction.

Methods Design: monocentric, randomized, cross-over trial. Each enrolled patient will undergo helmet NIV with all the following humidification strategies in a random order. Each period will last 60 minutes.

* Passive humidification, double tube circuit.
* Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher \& Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification chamber temperature 33°C.

Methods. All awake, collaborative, hypoxemic patients requiring mechanical ventilation will be considered for the enrollment. Hypercapnic patients (i.e.PaCO2\>45 mmHg) will be excluded. Each enrolled patient will undergo helmet NIV with all the following humidification strategies in a random order. Each period will last 60 minutes. * Passive humidification, double tube circuit. * Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher \& Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification chamber temperature 33°C. * Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher \& Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification chamber temperature 37°C. * Passive humidification with HME, Y-piece circuit. Ventilatory settings (Draeger Evita xl or Evita infinity ventilators): Pressure support ventilation; pressure support=20 cmH20; FiO2 titrated to obtain SpO2 between 92 and 98%; positive end-expiratory pressure=10 cmH2O; maximum inspiratory time 0.9 seconds; inspiratory flow trigger = 2 l/min; expiratory trigger: 30% of the maximum inspiratory flow; pressurization time=0,00 s. Such settings will be kept unchanged during the whole study period. An oesophageal catheter will be placed and secured to measure oesophageal pressure (Pes) and gastric pressure (Pga) (Nutrivent, Italy): the reliability of the measured pressure will be confirmed with an airway occlusion test during NIV with oronasal mask. Work of breathing will be estimated with the pressure-time product (PTP) of the pleural pressure. A pneumotachograph (KleisTek) will record flow, airway pressure, Pes and Pga on a dedicated laptop. At the end of each cycle, the patient will be asked to rate his/her discomfort on a visual analog scale (VAS) modified for ICU patients. The level of dyspnea will be assessed with the Borg dyspnea scale. The following parameters will be record at the end of each cycle: Arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2, pH, PCO2, PaO2, SaO2. Airway and esophageal pressure signals will be reviewed offline to detect patient-ventilator asynchronies (ineffective efforts, double cycling, premature cycling, delayed cycling) and asynchrony index (number of asynchrony events divided by the total respiratory rate computed as the sum of the number of ventilator cycles (triggered or not) and of wasted efforts) will be computed. The trigger delay will be also measured. The pressurization and depressurization velocity will be assessed with the PTP airway index 300 and 500 (inspiratory and expiratory), as suggested by Ferrone and coworkers. The work of breathing (WOB) for each breath will be estimated by PTPes. An hygrometer (Dimar SRL, Italy) will measure and record on a dedicated laptop Helmet temperature, relative and absolute humidity. Primary endpoints: patient's comfort, work of breathing and asynchrony index. Sample Sizing: Given the physiological design of the study, the investigators did not make an a priori sample size and plan to enroll 24 patients. Background Non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) is among first line treatments of acute respiratory failure. In patients with new-onset respiratory failure, NIV was showed to reduce the rate of complications and the length of ICU stay, as compared to invasive mechanical ventilation\[1\] Several interfaces are available for non-invasive ventilation: full face masks, oronasal masks, nasal prongs and helmets\[2\]. Despite full face and oronasal masks are more frequently used, some evidence suggests that helmets may optimize patients' comfort and NIV tolerability. The helmet allows patients' interaction, speech, feeding and does not limit cough. In addition, skin necrosis, gastric distension, or eye irritation are seldom observed during helmet NIV, while may be consequences of long-term treatments with face masks. \[3\] On the contrary, helmet NIV hampers tidal volume monitoring, is contraindicated in hypercapnic patients and requires specific ventilator settings\[4\]. Lastly, when compared to face masks, helmets may increase the work of breathing and worsen patient-ventilator interaction\[5\]\[6\]\[7\]. During NIV, humidification strategies (heat and moisture exchangers HME or heated humidifiers HH) may significantly affect patient's comfort and work of breathing \[8\]\[9\]. Despite physiological data suggested heated humidification as the best strategy during NIV with full face masks\[8\]\[9\], no differences were found in a randomized controlled study assessing the effects of HME or HH on a pragmatic clinical outcome\[10\]. However, the higher dead space (i.e. 18 L/min) and rebreathing rate observed during helmet NIV make such results not applicable to this particular setting. One only study assessed the effects of a HH during helmet low-flow continuous positive airway pressure on comfort in healthy volunteers\[11\]. Indeed, patients suffering from acute respiratory failure may behave differently, especially in terms of minute ventilation and maximum inspiratory flow. A recent bench study identified a better patient-ventilator interaction when helmet NIV was provided through a double tube circuit, as compared to the Y-piece system \[12\]. The investigators designed a randomized-crossover trial to assess the effect of four humidification strategies during helmet NIV on patients with acute respiratory failure, in terms of comfort, work of breathing and patient-ventilator interaction. Methods Design: monocentric, randomized, cross-over trial. Each enrolled patient will undergo helmet NIV with all the following humidification strategies in a random order. Each period will last 60 minutes. * Passive humidification, double tube circuit. * Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher \& Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification chamber temperature 33°C. * Heated humification (MR 730, Fisher \& Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), humidification chamber temperature 37°C. * Passive humidification with HME, Y-piece circuit.

COMBINED CONTACT CONTROL (CCC) an intervention that is identical to QUIT4EVER except Stay Quit Coach will not be included. The CCC controls for compensation, monitoring, time and attention effects.

Specific aims are to:

AIM 1: evaluate the efficacy of QUIT4EVER on rates of abstinence from cigarettes (assessed with multiple measures including bioverified abstinence) during short and long term abstinence (measured at 3 and 6 months).

Hypothesis 1: QUIT4EVER will be associated with increased long term abstinence (self-reported and bio-verified prolonged abstinence at the 3 and 6 month follow-up).

AIM 2: assess the impact of QUIT4EVER on counseling treatment completion and medication adherence.

Hypothesis 2. Increased abstinence associated with QUIT4EVER will be partially mediated by increased telephone counseling treatment completion and greater medication adherence.

AIM 3: calculate the relative cost-effectiveness of the QUIT4EVER intervention in quality adjusted life years (QALY).

NYU Langone Health,OTHER,NCT02459379,Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Magnetic Resonance Imaging Registry,Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Magnetic Resonance Imaging Registry (CIED-MRI Registry),"This is a prospective registry evaluating the safety of performing magnetic resonance (MRI) scans on patients who have cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs). This includes pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). This is not a a new device approval or new MRI scanner approval, only for a registry of patients who need to have an MRI scan who already have an FDA approved CIED that is not currently labeled for use in conjunction with an MRI scan. This registry is very similar to the previously approved MagnaSafe Registry that is now closed to new enrollment.","This Registry is an investigator initiated project designed to follow in the footsteps of the MagnaSafe Registry. MagaSafe was initiated to determine the risks of performing MRI for patients with pacemakers and Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICDs). The latter is closed to new enrollments as of April 2014; however, there is still a need to accumulate data on these devices. There is also a significant clinical need, in that patients who are insured by CMS are currently excluded from having MRI scans if they have a pacemaker or ICD. The only option available to them is to undergo removal of their entire system, have the MRI scan, and then have a new system implanted. This is impossible for many patients who are ""pacemaker dependent"". It also exposes the patient to a well-known risk of complication from the removal/extraction process as well as the re-implant procedure. This must be contrasted to the negligible risk of having an MRI scan with the device in place (assuming proper precautions are taken), based on MagaSafe data as well as a large body of supporting literature.

Magnetic resonance is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of many diseases of the brain, spinal cord, and musculoskeletal system. For some disease states, no acceptable alternative diagnostic imaging method is available. MRI is not only a superior imaging and diagnostic modality for many disorders, but also does not expose patients to ionizing radiation as does CT. The number of patients living with permanent pacemakers or ICDs is well into the millions (some estimates are up to 4 million in the US), and continues to increase. Likewise, the use of MRI continues to rise annually in all patient groups, however, as people advance in age, they are the most likely to need an MRI scan. As the device population is disproportionally weighted towards the older population, it is exactly this group that has the greatest need for MRI scans, yet may be denied.

As noted in the MagnaSafe information, ""To provide optimal care to the increasing number of patients with an implanted cardiac device, health care professionals must have the capability to perform MR imaging with minimal risk and full knowledge of the possible complications."" This registry recreates the protocol, safety monitoring and follow up in a manner very similar to other registries. The intent is to provide not only data that will hopefully continue to support the use of MRI scanning in device patients, but to allow this essential imaging technique to be available to patients without the need to expose them to 2 otherwise unnecessary procedures of removal and replacement of the implanted device.

This is a physician and institutional based registry that will start with New York University Langone Medical Center as collaboration between the Division of Cardiology (Electrophysiology Section) and the Department of Radiology (MRI imaging section). It is anticipated that additional sites may join in the registry over time, FDA permitting. The protocol is based on the widely published ""Hopkins protocol"" as attached to this submission. Several thousand patients have safely been scanned using this technique which emphasizes patient safety. Patients are monitored by experienced device personnel (ACLS certified) for vital signs (non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, pulse oximeter, and cardiac rhythm monitor (EKG)) while performing scans on patients with implanted devices. Scans are done at a major medical center equipped to manage any device or heart rhythm based complication should one occur. Only patients for whom no other imaging technique will provide adequate information are allowed to be scanned. The latter must be attested to by the physician who requires the information, and agreed upon by the electrophysiologist and the radiologist. IRB approval and a written investigator agreement will be required of any centers that may eventually participate in this registry.","Inclusion Criteria:

The only option available to them is to undergo removal of their entire system, have the MRI scan, and then have a new system implanted. This is impossible for many patients who are ""pacemaker dependent"". It also exposes the patient to a well-known risk of complication from the removal/extraction process as well as the re-implant procedure. This must be contrasted to the negligible risk of having an MRI scan with the device in place (assuming proper precautions are taken), based on MagaSafe data as well as a large body of supporting literature. Magnetic resonance is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of many diseases of the brain, spinal cord, and musculoskeletal system. For some disease states, no acceptable alternative diagnostic imaging method is available. MRI is not only a superior imaging and diagnostic modality for many disorders, but also does not expose patients to ionizing radiation as does CT. The number of patients living with permanent pacemakers or ICDs is well into the millions (some estimates are up to 4 million in the US), and continues to increase. Likewise, the use of MRI continues to rise annually in all patient groups, however, as people advance in age, they are the most likely to need an MRI scan. As the device population is disproportionally weighted towards the older population, it is exactly this group that has the greatest need for MRI scans, yet may be denied. As noted in the MagnaSafe information, ""To provide optimal care to the increasing number of patients with an implanted cardiac device, health care professionals must have the capability to perform MR imaging with minimal risk and full knowledge of the possible complications."" This registry recreates the protocol, safety monitoring and follow up in a manner very similar to other registries. The intent is to provide not only data that will hopefully continue to support the use of MRI scanning in device patients, but to allow this essential imaging technique to be available to patients without the need to expose them to 2 otherwise unnecessary procedures of removal and replacement of the implanted device. This is a physician and institutional based registry that will start with New York University Langone Medical Center as collaboration between the Division of Cardiology (Electrophysiology Section) and the Department of Radiology (MRI imaging section). It is anticipated that additional sites may join in the registry over time, FDA permitting. The protocol is based on the widely published ""Hopkins protocol"" as attached to this submission. Several thousand patients have safely been scanned using this technique which emphasizes patient safety. Patients are monitored by experienced device personnel (ACLS certified) for vital signs (non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, pulse oximeter, and cardiac rhythm monitor (EKG)) while performing scans on patients with implanted devices. Scans are done at a major medical center equipped to manage any device or heart rhythm based complication should one occur. Only patients for whom no other imaging technique will provide adequate information are allowed to be scanned. The latter must be attested to by the physician who requires the information, and agreed upon by the electrophysiologist and the radiologist. IRB approval and a written investigator agreement will be required of any centers that may eventually participate in this registry. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Male or female, age 18 or older 2. Permanent pacemaker or ICD (single, dual or multichamber), generator implanted AFTER 2001 3. Only non-MRI Conditionally Safe pacemakers and leads (but otherwise approved by the U.S. FDA ) will be included 4. Clinical indication for MRI imaging for which no other imaging modality will give adequate results to manage the patient 5. Device must have been implanted for 6 weeks or longer 6. Patient or patient's advocate must be able and willing to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria: 1. Presence of a lead without fixation (e.g. stand-alone SVC coil) 2.

To determine the effect of habitual and moderate consumption of beer on physical fitness, body composition, psychokinetic and cognitive abilities and psychological status in sedentary healthy adults undergoing a HIIT training program.

The primary hypothesis will that a HIIT program will induce an improvement on physical fitness, body composition, psychokinetic abilities and psychological responses compared to a control group but this positive effect could be blunted by alcohol intake.

Methods:

HIIT-BEER will recruit 80 sedentary, healthy, adults (50% women) aged 18-40 years.

Will be performed a 10-week controlled trial in which the effects of HIIT will be compared to a control group without training. The effects of habitual intake of different alcoholic beverage will be also compared.

After completing the baseline measurements, the selected participants will be randomly assigned to either the control or the exercise training groups. The participants included in the training groups will be asked to choose individual choice about their drinking preference for alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages. The participants who chose alcohol intake will be randomly assigned into the training group with alcohol beer intake (5.4% Alcohol-Special Alhambra®, Cervezas Alhambra, Spain) or to the sparkling water group with exactly the same amount of distilled alcohol added. The distilled alcoholic beverage used for the investigator's study will be vodka because of the purity of its composition (37.5% ethanol and 62.5% water). The participants who chose non-alcoholic beverages will be randomized into the training groups of non-alcohol beer (0.0% alcohol-Cruzcampo®, Heineken España) or sparkling water (Eliges (IFA) Eliqua 2®, Font Salem, Spain) intakes.

So, eligible participants will be assigned to five groups: (i) a group that will performed HIIT and will consumed 330 ml (women) or 2x300 ml (men) of beer with 5.4% alcohol (HIIT-AB, n=16); (ii) a group that will performed HIIT and will consumed the same amount of beer without alcohol (0.0%) (HIIT-NAB; n=16); (iii) a group that will performed HIIT and will consumed the same amount of sparkling water (0.0%) (HIIT-W; n=16); (iv) a group that will performed HIIT and will consumed sparkling water with the same amount of alcohol than the pre-established beer (5.4%) (HIIT-ASW; n=16); and (v) a control group that will not perform any physical training program (CON; n=16).

The beverage intakes will be programmed from Monday to Friday. There will not specific recommendation for Saturday and Sunday, but the participants will be instructed to keep a moderate alcohol during the weekend.

Laboratory measures completed at baseline and 10 weeks later, include physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength), body composition, hearth rate variability (HRV), reaction time, cognitive variables and health-related questionnaires. The investigators will also obtain dietary habits data and cardiovascular disease risk factors.","Inclusion Criteria:

Since individuals spend most of the day in the fed (or postprandial) state, it is important to see how different types of dietary fatty acids affect postprandial white adipose tissue and systemic metabolic-inflammatory responses.

This study will investigate the effect of a SFA-rich meal on markers of white adipose tissue and systemic metabolic-inflammation, compared to a MUFA-rich meal in overweight adults.

University of Alberta,OTHER,NCT05255679,Early FES Cycling in Acute Spinal Cord Injury for Neuromuscular Preservation and Neurorecovery,Pilot Study on the Effect of Early FES Cycling After Acute Spinal Cord Injury on Neuromuscular Preservation and Neurorecovery,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that often leads to paralysis and multiple health problems such as muscle wasting, bone loss and spasticity. Despite the paralysis, functional electrical stimulation (FES) on the skin surface muscles may produce muscle contractions. People who have had an SCI for a long time (chronic SCI) already use FES cycling to exercise, and it is known that it can reverse muscle atrophy and has a wide range of health benefits. Furthermore, animal research suggests that starting exercise training early after new SCI may promote spinal cord recovery. However, not much is known about early FES cycling in humans. Therefore, the investigators propose to study if early FES cycling could prevent muscle wasting, pain or spasticity, and help with spinal cord recovery.

The study will recruit 36 participants with a new, acute SCI, between 14 and 21 days after their injury into 3 groups. An Early-FES group starts FES cycling early after injury (between 14 and 21 days after injury), and for a duration of 6 months. A Delayed-FES group starts FES cycling 3 months after enrolling in the study, and for a duration of 3 months. A Control group does not perform FES cycling.

This pilot study will allow us to study if early FES cycling, in addition to normal care, has greater benefits on the preservation and recovery of the leg muscles and spinal cord function than delayed FES cycling or standard care only. The results of this pilot study may lead to the development of a larger study with early FES cycling after new SCI.","Spinal cord injury (SCI) usually results in weakness or paralysis in the legs and/or arms, depending on the level and severity of the damage to the spinal cord. In addition, people with SCI often develop several complications in the long term, such as muscle wasting (atrophy), loss of bone strength, pain, and spasticity.

Despite the weakness or paralysis, the muscles in a person with SCI can be activated using electrical stimulation applied on the skin surface of the muscles. This technique is called functional electrical stimulation (FES) and can be used in combination with a bike to perform a cycling movement (FES cycling). People who have had an SCI for a long time (chronic SCI) already use FES cycling to exercise, and it is known that it can reverse muscle atrophy and has a wide range of health benefits. Furthermore, animal research suggests that starting exercise training early after new SCI may promote spinal cord recovery.

A Delayed-FES group starts FES cycling 3 months after enrolling in the study, and for a duration of 3 months. A Control group does not perform FES cycling. People with an acute, complete or incomplete SCI that resulted in paralysis from the waist down (paraplegia) or neck down (quadriplegia) will be considered. The Early and Delayed FES group will be recruited from the University of Alberta Hospital (UAH) where the FES bikes are available. Participants will be assigned by chance into Early and Delayed FES group. The control group will be mainly recruited from the Royal Alexandra Hospital, where the FES bikes are currently not available. The FES groups will perform FES cycling sessions 3 times per week (up to 1 hour per session) and receive standard care (typically including physical and occupational therapy). The Control group will only receive standard care.

The FES cycling will be performed while the participants are lying in bed using a bed bike, or while sitting in a wheel chair using chair-based bike. Both systems use pedals that are strapped to the feet and an electrical stimulator to activate several muscles of both legs using electrodes attached to the skin.

The following will be measured: 1) the size of the leg muscles and amount of fat in the legs using a CT scanner. 2) strength of the muscles using manual tests and by the electrical signals in the muscle. 3) spasticity by measuring electrical responses in the muscle when stimulated, as well as with clinical scales. 4) strength of the electrical connections between brain and spinal cord. 5) clinical measures such as the spinal injury classification, pain and reflexes. 6) response of participants to the FES cycling program. 7) cost and health care resources for the administration of early and delayed FES cycling. All 3 groups will undergo the same assessments.

This pilot study will allow the investigators to study if early FES cycling, in addition to standard care, has greater benefits on the preservation and recovery of the leg muscles and spinal cord function than standard care only. The results of this pilot study may lead to the development of a multi-center clinical trial with early FES cycling after new SCI, which may have important and innovative implications in the future rehabilitation practice, improving the health, function and quality of life of persons with SCI.","Inclusion Criteria:

Patients will receive micafungin for the period necessary to achieve clinical and / or mycological cure. An attempt will be made to have 2 PK curves, one full and one limited sampling on days 3 (n=9) and 7 (n=5). Furthermore, we will be able to determine intra-individual variability. On non-PK days, trough samples will be taken to determine the time to steady state. All samples will be taken just prior to the morning dose of micafungin. All infusion rates will be according to the SPC label information. Patients are considered to be evaluable if at least the first PK curve has been completed. Two moments of PK analysis will enable us to determine whether there is an increase over time in exposure if steady state has not been reached.","Whilst micafungin (Mycamine®) has much to offer, little is known about its pharmacokinetic profile in ICU patients with specific co-morbidities such as obesity, hypoalbumenia, and severe liverfunction disturbances. Also, ICU patients are known to experience changes in pharmacokinetics (PK) due to changes in hemodynamics, extracorporeal elimination techniques, interacting comedication, etc. Based on criteria outlined below, micafungin may prove to be the drug of choice in this cohort of patients. Therefore it seems prudent to conduct a trial in a cohort of patients who receive micafungin but with co-variates that may be of influence to the pharmacokinetic profile. To build a valid pharmacokinetic model, all patients on micafungin will be included in the analysis and used for model building. Co-variates that will be explored are at least: obesitas, liverfunction, albumin, creatinin-clearance. Simulations will be performed to determine if adequate exposure is reached under different patho-physiological conditions.

In conclusion: this trial is on determining the PK of micafungin in a non-selected cohort of patients with suspected or proven invasive fungal infections.

British Columbia Cancer Agency,OTHER,NCT02808884,Cancer DNA Screening Pilot Study (CANDACE),Cancer DNA Screening Pilot Study (CANDACE),The investigators have developed an assay that can sensitively and specifically detect DNA mutations circulating in human plasma that may be indicators of the presence of a solid tumor. This study is a pilot study to measure positive and negative predictive values of this assay as an indicator of the presence of a tumor in normal subjects,"Participants consenting for the study will be requested to consent for an initial collection of two vials of blood (\~ 20 ml total) and to answer questions regarding aspects of their medical history and lifestyle that are relevant to cancer risk. Participants in the study will also be asked to provide consent for follow-up blood samples, and if the confirmatory tests show a positive result, follow-up PET/CT scans and other investigations.

1,000 participants between the ages of 55 and 75 will be enrolled through BC Generations Project. This is a invite-only study.

* Respondents who provide consent and choose to be enrolled in the study will then be directed to an online questionnaire where they will be asked to answer questions regarding their lifestyle and medical history.
* The consent form and questionnaire results will be electronically received at the UBC study site.
* Once participant information has been received at UBC, it will be entered into a password protected spreadsheet on a UBC server. At that point, participants will be sent a requisition form directing them to one of several possible blood collection sites (LifeLabs), where two 10mL blood draws will be collected by a phlebotomist. Blood collections will be paid for by Boreal through a contract with LifeLabs, and will be performed in Streck stabilized cfDNA blood collection tubes (capable of storing blood at room temperature for over a week).
* Once collected, the two blood tubes will be delivered by LifeLabs to BC Cancer Research Center within 24-48 hrs of collection. The tubes will be collected by study staff (within 5 days of the initial blood draw) and transported to UBC, where they will be de-identified and assigned a random identifier (UBC study number). Any personal identification on the tubes will be completely removed, by abrasion if necessary. Identifying information will be entered in a password protected spreadsheet (on a UBC server) linking the participant information to the UBC study number. From this point on, the blood samples, and subsequent fractions and results, will only be identified by the study number. The de-identified tubes will be transported to Boreal Genomics where they will be separated into plasma and cellular fraction including erythrocytes and buffy coat. The non-plasma components of the blood samples will be pooled and subsequently discarded. The plasma fraction will be placed in a separate tube and frozen for subsequent analysis. The original blood tubes (now empty), will be destroyed.
* Frozen plasma samples, now de-identified, will be delivered to Pathway Genomics (San Diego, CA) where DNA content will be analyzed with a circulating tumor DNA assay employing the UBC/Boreal Genomics enrichment technology. All of the participants' plasma will be sent to Pathway, where it will be used up in the assay. Any plasma not consumed in the assay will be destroyed. No plasma, blood or other samples will be stored at either Pathway Genomics or UBC, beyond any temporary storage (1-2 weeks) required to perform the assay.
* Circulating tumor DNA assay results (raw sequencing data) from Pathway Genomics will be returned to UBC and analyzed for the presence of cancer mutations. Any samples showing activating mutations above the assay's technical Limit of Detection (LOD) will be called positive. One exception will be made for TP53 mutations that are known to exist in some normal individuals at low levels. For these mutations, a level of 0.1% will be set, above which the sample will be called positive.
* Once the data is analyzed, participants with a negative result will be sent an email thanking them for their participation and informing them of the negative result.
* Participants whose sample provided a positive result will be contacted immediately by telephone by an oncologist co-investigator and concurrently sent a letter by mail informing them of the result and asking them to return for a second blood draw. The investigators expect that this communication will happen with about a month of the original blood draw. The letter will include contact information for the study team and the oncologist co-investigators, in case the participant has any questions or concerns at this stage. A requisition form will be sent with the letter. Two 10mL tubes of blood will be drawn at the blood collection visit, to allow repeat testing and confirmation that the mutation is present consistently.
* Samples from the additional draw will be treated as described above for the initial samples, with two exceptions. One, the samples will be processed at Boreal Genomics instead of being shipped to Pathway Genomics. Two, some buffy coat DNA (germline DNA) will also be tested for the 96 cancer mutations present on the Boreal panel to detect rare cases where the circulating tumor DNA signal derives from low level germline mutations instead of tumor DNA. This testing will be done at Boreal Genomics and any remaining buffy coat or DNA not consumed in the test will be discarded. Data from the circulating tumor DNA assay and buffy coat test will be returned to UBC and compared to the initial blood result.
* Participants who are found to have a cancer-associated germline mutation during the foregoing testing will be informed by the oncologist co-investigators and will be offered a consultation with the Hereditary Cancer Program at the BC Cancer Agency where they can meet with a medical geneticist for a consultation. If they wish it, these participants would have access to clinically validated retesting for the germline mutation.
* Participants for which the additional blood sample does not yield positive results for cancer mutations, will be contacted by telephone to explain the results.
* Participants for whom the additional blood sample yields a positive result for the same cancer mutations seen in the first blood draw will be contacted by telephone by an oncologist co-investigator, to explain the results and next steps. They will also be sent a letter. The investigators expect this communication to happen within about a week of the second blood draw. Pending oncological evaluation of the participant (see below) and study results, a PET-CT scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) agent, and possibly other tests will be requested. Unless the oncological exams suggest otherwise, the default follow-up will be a full body PET-CT. The participants undergoing medical imaging scans will be given a requisition form and directed to have the requested scan, which will be paid for by the study sponsor (Boreal Genomics).
* Recognizing that being advised of an abnormal DNA test may cause participants distress, the investigators have committed to (a) complete testing and to contact the participant about the result of 2nd test within 14 days of the blood being drawn; (b) notification of 2nd result (abnormal or normal) being done by phone by the study oncologist (c) pre-booking the follow-up oncological evaluation appointment and offering the participant two options when phoned to advise of the 2nd abnormal result (d) completing the oncological evaluation within 3 weeks of the patient being advised that the 2nd test is abnormal.
* The oncological evaluation will be performed at the Vancouver Centre of the BC Cancer Agency and is likely to include:

  * A full history, including risk factors for cancer and a review of systems to seek symptoms that could be from cancer.
  * A physical examination of:

    - Head and neck, thorax, abdomen, skin, neurological system lymphatic system and rectum. In men: prostate examination. In women: breast and gynecological examinations
  * A whole-body PET-CT scan
  * Standard age-appropriate cancer screening investigations such as the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for colorectal cancer, Papanicolaou test for cervix cancer and mammography for breast cancer, if they have not been completed, are due, or are overdue.
  * Additional investigations will be guided by the history, physical examination, whole-body PET-CT and standard screening investigations.
  * Investigations may include: complete blood count, liver enzymes, tumour markers, urinalysis, contrast-enhanced MRI, contrast-enhanced CT, as well as endoscopy of the head and neck, bronchi, bladder, upper GI tract and lower GI tract.
* Results of these tests will be returned to the oncologist investigators and to Dr. Marziali and then entered into the study database. The results will be communicated to the participant in writing as well as in person or by phone. The oncologist will refer participants for additional testing and to appropriate clinicians for follow up for additional investigations. The oncologist will also offer a referral of participants to supportive counseling at this stage.
* The results will be communicated to the participant's family physician, if the participant has one, by an oncologist investigator.
* Participants whose investigations detect a potentially malignant mass will have a biopsy, either with imaging guidance, or through referral to an appropriate specialist.
* Participants, whose investigations do not detect a potentially malignant mass, will be informed in writing, as well as in person or by phone that the circulating tumor DNA test gave a false positive result and will be advised to continue with appropriate cancer screening for their age and family history.
* Participants with positive circulating tumor DNA results who are unwilling to undergo further testing including possible PET-CTs will still be offered a follow up visit with the oncologist co-investigator to discuss the results and to offer supportive counseling as described above.
* A year following the initial blood draw, participants will be contacted by email to determine if a cancer diagnosis has been made during that time. For non-responding participants, they will be telephoned and their family physicians will be sent a letter inquiring whether the participant was diagnosed with cancer.

VA Office of Research and Development,FED,NCT02157779,Treatment of Trauma-Related Anger in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans,Treatment of Trauma-Related Anger in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans,"Excessive and poorly controlled anger is one of the most common problems experienced by war Veterans. The consequences can be severe, including increased risk for divorce, domestic violence, job loss and instability, and other serious impairments in family, social, and occupational functioning. Availability of effective treatments is critical to reducing the adverse effects of anger in Veterans. The investigators propose to conduct a controlled study to determine whether a cognitive behavior treatment that has been adapted for treating anger problems in Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan results in improved outcomes compared to a supportive therapy. Results will be examined for improvement in anger, functioning, and quality of life at end of 12 weekly sessions, and at 3 and 6 months following treatment.","Poorly controlled anger is a common problem with often devastating effects in Veterans who have served in a warzone. Adverse consequences include increased risk for divorce, domestic violence, job loss and instability, and other serious impairments in family, social, and occupational functioning. Recent evidence indicates that anger and aggression are likely to be problems for a significant proportion of Veterans of Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF; Operation New Dawn, OND) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF).

"Northern Orthopaedic Division, Denmark",OTHER,NCT00379184,Sensitization in Osteoarthritic Knees,Quantitative Assessment of Central Sensitization in Osteoarthritis Patients,"Musculoskeletal pains represent a major part of pain complaints in patients. Moreover, the treatment of musculoskeletal pain conditions by currently available drugs is not optimal (Curatolo and Bogduk 2001). Thus, deep pain is a diagnostic and therapeutic problem, and further insights into the peripheral and central neurophysiologic mechanisms are necessary to improve diagnosis and therapy and to implement a mechanism-based approach. Peripheral sensitization and central hyper excitability are, most likely the important factors for chronic musculoskeletal pain and in particular osteoarthritis (OA).

The focus of this project is to study the involvement of peripheral and central sensitization underlying deep tissue hyperalgesia and referred pain in male and female OA patients.

Adequate quantitative sensory testing assessment techniques for measuring hyper excitability are needed to investigate, in more detail the mechanisms involved in generating the sensitization in OA patients.","Methods

General procedure:

In the Outpatient Department of Clinic Farsoe, Northern Orthopaedic Division patients eligible for participating in the study will be informed and asked to participate. Those who agree and sign the informed consent will be scheduled for the investigational procedures to be performed at the SMI as soon as possible.

At the SMI all patients are interviewed and assessed with the following three procedures with at least 10 minutes between procedures. Duration of visit will be approximately 3 hours in one session.

Procedure 1:

Pressure pain sensitivity and temporal summation of pressure pain

Equipment: computer controlled pressure algometer.

Sites: knee, tibialis anterior, forearm

* Stimulus intensity: pressure pain threshold
* Stimuli number: 10
* Frequency: ISI 1s
* Pain rating: pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, unpleasantness and after-sensations will be collected.

General:

Pressure pain sensitivity and temporal summation of pressure are tested on bilateral knee, tibialis anterior muscle and forearm. Test sites are located and marked according to the landmark stated below. Pressure pain threshold of these test sites are measured first. Sequential stimulations are applied to these test sites respectively to test the pain perception for each press stimulus. Unpleasantness and after-sensations are collected after cessation of sequential stimulation to evaluate the affective aspect of pain.

Specific:

Seven test sites (2 cm proximal to the superior lateral edge of patella, 2 cm proximal to the superior edge of patella, 2 cm proximal to the superior medial edge of patella, 2 cm distal to the inferior lateral edge of patella, 2 cm distal to the inferior medial edge of patella, 5 cm lateral to the superior lateral edge of patella and 5 cm medial to the superior medial edge of patella) are marked around the knee. The site for measuring temporal summation of pain is the most sensitive site among these five sites.

The test site on the arm is 7 cm distal to the lateral humeral epicondyle on the line connecting the lateral epicondyle and the styloid process of the radius, located on the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle.

The test site on the leg is at the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle 14 cm distal to the inferior lateral edge of the patella.

Pressure pain threshold on these test sites are measured. A mechanical pressure stimulus with gradient of 0.3 kg/s will be applied until the subject reports pain and presses a stop button. The PPT measurements start from the contralateral knee of the affected knee.

Sequential stimulation consists of 10 pressure stimuli (1 sec duration) at the pressure pain threshold level. Inter-stimulus interval (ISI) is set to 1 sec. Skin contact between the individual pressure stimuli will be ensured by keeping a constant force of 0.1 kg; i.e. during the series of sequential stimulation the probe has skin contact and is first withdrawn after 10 stimulations. The subjects rate the pain intensity continuously during the sequential stimulation on an electronic visual analogue scale (VAS) on which ""0"" indicates ""no pain"" and ""10 cm"" indicates ""maximal pain"". Sequential stimulation is to be applied on each test site with at least a 1 min interval. The sequence of test sites is chosen in a randomized way to minimize order effects.

Unpleasantness and after-sensations are collected 15 sec after cessation of sequential stimulation.

Procedure 2:

Referred pain

Equipment: computer controlled pressure algometer, computer-controlled auto-infusion syringe pump.

* Site: tibialis anterior
* Concentration: 6% hypertonic saline.
* Method: continuous infusion.
* Pain rating: pain intensity, pain area drawing (primary and secondary pain area), pressure pain threshold, unpleasantness and after-sensations will be collected.

General:

Hypertonic saline is infused into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle to elicit local and referred pain. The experiment will be conducted in one leg at a time, by giving a single bolus infusion of hypertonic saline with a time interval of approximately 20 min between each leg. Test sites are located and marked on the TA. Pressure pain thresholds on injection site and front side of ankle are measured before infusion. Hypertonic saline is infused by using a computer-controlled syringe pump. Subjects report pain intensity and draw the pain area induced by infusion. Pressure pain thresholds on injection site and front side of ankle are measured 10 min after infusion- evoked-pain disappears. Unpleasantness and after-sensations for the evoked pain are collected as well.

Specific:

Injection site is placed at the belly of the TA 14 cm distal to the inferior lateral edge of the patella on both legs. At the marked site in the TA a 24G - 40 mm needle will be inserted vertically until a piercing of the muscle fascia is felt, at a depth of approximately 20 mm from the skin surface. Then the plunger of the syringe will be withdrawn to ensure that the needle is deep in the muscle and not in a blood vessel. The needle will then be connected through a polyethylene extension tube (Vygon, France, No. 1155.70) to a 10 ml syringe fitted in a computer-controlled auto-infusion syringe pump (Terumo Terufusion syringe pump, model STC-S27, Type CG). A total volume of 0.5 ml sterile 6% hypertonic saline (58.5 mg/ml, Sygehus Apotekerne, Denmark) will be infused over 20 s into the TA muscle (infusion-rate 90 ml/h).

The pain intensity response is scored on a visual analogue scale (VAS) after the infusion. The subjects mark the painful region(s) on pain maps after the infusion. Local pain is defined as the pain area drawn at the infusion site, referred pain is defined as the pain areas drawn away from the infusion site and radiating pain is defined as the pain areas drawn radiating from the local site into the other regions of the leg.

Pressure pain thresholds on injection site and front side of ankle are measured before and 10 min after infusion when infusion evoked pain disappears.

Unpleasantness and after-sensations for the evoked pain are collected afterwards.

Procedure 3:

Cuff pressure pain and DNIC

Equipment: computer controlled cuff algometer.

* Site: upper arms
* Pain rating: pain intensity, cuff pressure pain threshold, pressure pain threshold, unpleasantness and after-sensations collected.

General:

Continuous cuff pressure stimulation is applied to measure the inhibitory control of the pain sensory system. Cuff stimulation is applied to bilateral upper arms and tibialis anterior (location see procedure 1). Pressure pain threshold on the test sites around knee, on the ipsilateral and contralateral arm (on the belly of biceps brachii) are measured before, during and after cuff pressure stimulation. Cuff pressure stimulation is applied by computer-controlled cuff algometer to induce continuous pain perception for 10 min. Pain intensity of ongoing pain in the stimulated limb and affected knee are rated on electrical VAS.

Specific:

The cuff is wrapped around the middle of both arms. The lower rim of the tourniquet cuff (7.5 cm wide) is at least 3 cm proximal to the cubital fossa. The setup of the cuff algometer is programmed to stop the pressure increase at a preset pain intensity of 4 cm on the VAS and to automatically adjust the pressure to maintain the obtained pain within ±0.5 cm VAS for 10 min or until the subject presses the stop button. If the pain increases over the upper pain limit, the system decreases the pressure until the pain returns into the 'target' zone and vice versa.

When the VAS rise up to 4 cm and keep constant for 1 min, we will measure PPTs on the same test sites except tested arm. Pain intensity of ongoing pain in affected knee and arm which is not stimulated is rated on another electrical VAS during cuff pressure stimulation. Five minutes following deflation, pain intensity of ongoing pain in affected knee and arms is rated. Fifteen minutes following deflation, PPTs are measured on the test sites.

The sequence of test limb is chosen at random to minimize order effects.","Inclusion Criteria:

Abbott Medical Devices,INDUSTRY,NCT00487279,DEfibrillators To REduce Risk by MagnetIc ResoNance Imaging Evaluation,DEfibrillators To REduce Risk by MagnetIc ResoNance Imaging Evaluation,"This trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized study of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and mild to moderate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) therapy in combination with medical therapy in patients with an infarct size greater than or equal to 10% of the left ventricular mass improves long term survival compared to medical therapy alone. In addition to the 2-arm randomized trial, the study will also include a non-investigational registry of non-randomized patients.","Detailed Description:

The utilization of ICD therapy has resulted in significant reduction in mortality among those at highest risk of sudden cardiac death, such as survivors of cardiac arrest and patients presenting with symptomatic sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with CAD and advanced LV dysfunction (EF \<35%) also benefit from ICD. However, although at high risk, these patients represent only a small percentage of the population who die suddenly. While there are many tests that have been used for stratification of risk for sudden cardiac death, the two that have documented clinical utility are determination of left ventricular ejection fraction and presence of inducibility of ventricular tachycardia during programmed electrical stimulation performed as part of EP testing. The utility of these tests likely result from their ability to select patients who have the requisite substrate allowing for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. It has been shown that ventricular tachycardia occurs more commonly in the setting of larger infarcts. Ejection fraction has been related to infarct size; presumably, the larger the area of infarction, the lower the ejection fraction. Electrophysiologic testing directly establishes the presence of substrate by the actual induction of ventricular tachycardia.

A major limitation of electrophysiologic programmed stimulation is the high number of false negative findings. Thus, a significant number of patients without inducible arrhythmias remain at risk. CE-MRI provides functional information (EF, LV Volumes, LV mass, etc), which is routine in the initial evaluation of post-MI patients, and in addition provides detailed geometry of scar tissue. There is a clear association between inducible arrhythmias and scar size which until the development of cardiac MRI, could not be seen in humans. Use of cardiac MRI has demonstrated that although most patients with a large MI were inducible, a small but significant number of patients, who remain at risk, were not inducible. There was also an association between death and infarct size in patients with cardiovascular risk factors but no established CAD.

The Center for Medicare Services (CMS) has recently decided in a coverage decision that patients with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, and an ejection fraction of \<35% would be eligible to receive an ICD as long as they are enrolled in a prospective registry. Patients with LV ejection fractions greater than 35% or those without heart failure and ejection fractions over 30%, represent a more difficult management dilemma. However, since the majority of out of hospital cardiac arrests occur in patients with EF \>35%, managing these patients is crucial in addressing the epidemiologic problem of sudden cardiac death.

The primary objective of this trial is to test the hypothesis that therapy with an ICD combined with medical therapy improves long-term survival compared to medical therapy alone in patients with CAD, infarct mass greater than or equal to 10% of the left ventricle and left ventricular dysfunction who do not have an indication for ICD by either of the following criteria. Patients must have an EF of \>35% or have an EF of 30-35% and must not have inducible ventricular tachycardia or have NYHA Class II or greater heart failure (Target Population).

The secondary objective is to test the hypothesis that therapy with an ICD combined with medical therapy improves arrhythmic survival compared to medical therapy alone in patients with CAD, infarct mass greater than or equal to 10% and left ventricular dysfunction who do not have an indication for ICD based on the Target Population described above.

Recruitment: All patients who have a history of coronary heart disease (CAD) with documentation of either myocardial infarction (MI) or left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), a preliminary ejection fraction (EF) \> 35% and have previously undergone a contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) study for clinical diagnostic reasons or as part of the study entry screening procedure may be further evaluated for eligibility for this trial. In addition, patients with an ejection fraction of 30-35% may be eligible for the study if they do not currently have an indication for an ICD based on Target Population criteria described above. These patients may have NYHA Class I heart failure, no non-sustained VT on holter monitor, or if non-sustained VT is present, there is the absence of inducible VT at EP study.

The first 1550 patients who are found to have an EF \>30% with NYHA Class I heart failure or 35% by routine clinical evaluation and who also have an MI involving greater than or equal to 10% of total left ventricular mass will be enrolled in the main randomized portion of the trial. These patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: ICD therapy in combination with medical therapy (ICD Group) or medical therapy alone (Control Group).

Follow-Up: Clinic visits are required every 6 months until the completion of the study. Telephone contact is required every six months to assess vital status and obtain new information regarding medical status and/or medical events. The telephone calls alternate with the clinical visits, so that patient contact will occur every 3 months until the completion of the study.

Non-Investigational Registry:

The primary objective of the registry sub-study is to test the hypothesis that infarct mass as measured by contrast enhanced Cardiac MRI (CE-MRI) is a better predictor for sudden cardiac death than LV ejection fraction. The registry will examine infarct mass as measured by Cardiac MRI and LV ejection fraction (EF) as predictors for SCD.

The purpose of the registry is hypothesis generating and no labeling or other indications are anticipated based on registry findings.

Participation in the Registry requires that the patient has undergone a contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI prior to enrollment. In order to ensure consistent infarct mass assessments, the cardiac MRI study submitted to determine eligibility for randomization must meet the following criteria:

1. CE-cardiac MRIs must be obtained using Siemens, General Electric or Phillips equipment.
2. The contrast agent must be gadolinium-based at a dose sufficient to render images of acceptable quality.
3. The CE-cardiac MRI must be available for electronic submission to the MRI Core laboratory for analysis.

If techniques for infarct mass measurement or data acquisition change during the course of the trial, the Core laboratory and the Steering Committee may choose to alter some of the above parameters.

Once consent to participate in the registry has been obtained, the site will forward the CE-MRI study to the CE-MRI core lab for analysis to determine placement in the appropriate registry, baseline demographics characteristics will be collected on all registry patients. This will aid in statistical analysis to verify the generalizability of the findings. The differences in total survival between these groups will also be compared using the same methodology as for the primary end-point. Patients with and without ICD implants will be compared separately. In addition, blood specimens for genetic sampling and biomarker testing will be obtained on all patients in the registry cohort who agree, to determine if any of SCD substrates exist in the DETERMINE registry population.

Study subjects will be contacted by mail by the Endpoint Coordinating Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston every 6 months to determine vital status and obtain any new information regarding change in medical status or the occurrence of any medical events. This will promote the continued relationship between the study participant and the enrolling center and can also be used to remind the study subject of their next scheduled appointment.

Scope and Duration of the trial:

Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,OTHER,NCT01407484,Male Infertility Related With Post Infection Inflammatory Syndrome,Diagnosis and Treatment of Male Infertility Related to Inflammatory Syndrome: Therapeutic Trial,"BACKGROUND: One couple out of 6 consults for infertility during their sexual life. In 60% of cases a male factor is associated or is the main infertility factor. Inflammatory Syndrome (IS), characterized by the presence of a leukocytospermia is found in 12% of the cases. Leukocyte degranulation causes oxidative stress (OS) through the formation of free radicals attacking the sperm cell functions.

HYPOTHESIS: To establish the responsibility of the IS, and OS, in chronicle inflammatory male infertility, the investigators hypothesize that its treatment (as well as its possible cause) must restore or improve the fertilizing capacity of patients sperm.

METHODS: This prospective randomized study will test the response to the treatment. The investigators shall measure cellular degradation products due to the OS, thereby certifying that it does have a deleterious effect on sperm cell. Seminal biochemistry will also assess the impact of the syndrome on the genital tract glands and follow its evolution.

The patients will be included in the study as soon as the leukocytospermia will be \> 0,5\*106/ml or as soon as the elastase will be \> 500 ng/mL.

The examinations will be performed using flow cytometry, CASA (Computer Assisted Semen Analysis). The analysis of sperm morphology will be centralized.

Primary endpoint will be a reduction in the percentage of 8OH-dG below 35 %. We anticipate that it should arrive to 20 % of the patients included in the arm treatment by corticosteroid therapy. All in all will thus be needed 50 patients in the group placebo and 50 in the group treated.

Secondary endpoint the improvement of the spermatic parameters and the reduction of the fragmentation of the DNA of sperm cells to the treated subjects.

All these biological markers will be evaluated 6 month after the treatment:

* Fragmentation of the spermatic DNA below 37 % during the follow-up in 6 months

* Duration of inclusions: 30 months
* Duration of patient follow-up: 7 months
* Total duration of the study: 37 months Within the framework of their coverage in AMP, the barren couples have a consultation with the doctors of the reproduction and one with the biologists. Between these two visits, a spermatic balance assessment (EXAMINATION N°0) is made including a semen culture, a spermogram or a test of migration survival (TMS) and an elastase.

On the occasion of this examination, aliquots for the measure of 8OH-dG, fragmentation of the spermatic DNA and seminal biochemistry will systematically be taken.

Within the framework of this standard balance assessment of infertility, it is possible that an echography and a MRI of the genital ways are prescribed; if it is the case, the data of these examinations will be collected in the case report form. But these examinations will not be specifically asked for the search.

If a leukocytospermia ≥ 0,5\*106/ml is discovered or an increase of the elastase ≥ 500 ng / ml, the dosages of 8OH-dG, the fragmentation and the seminal biochemistry will be made.

The patients will then be seen in consultation of biology (CONSULTATION OF BIOLOGY N°0 = visit of inclusion and randomization).

* If the patients present 8OH-dG \> 35 %, and that their semen culture is negative, it will be suggested to them being included in the protocol and the randomization will be made that very day; the patients will receive or an anti-inflammatory treatment (Prednisone) is a treatment placebo.
* If 8OH-dG \< 35 % it will be suggested to them participating in the study of the follow-up of the spontaneous evolution of the SO and of SI over 6 months.

A first complete balance assessment will be made in 1 month (EXAMINATION N°1) after the beginning of the treatment in the study (Prednisone or placebo) so as to estimate the evolution at the end of the treatment of the inflammatory and oxidative parameters This balance assessment will not be realized at the inclusive but not randomized patient's.

Patients randomized in the study will have laboratory tests including:

* A semen analysis (leukocytospermia)
* A measure of oxidative stress (8OHd guanosine assay - assay of protein carbonyl - DNA fragmentation)
* A seminal biochemistry (acid 1-4)alpha phosphatase, citrate, zinc, fructose, carnitine and glucosidase

A second balance assessment will be asked 6 months (EXAMINATION N°2) after the beginning of the treatment for two reasons: the first reason is that the improvement of the spermatic parameters is slowly made. If a spermatic change settled down during years she is not going to disappear in the fortnight. It is effectively the experience which we have of it.

Besides the spermatogenesis continuing over three months, a new cycle of production of sperm cells can be estimated only more than three months after the treatment. The second reason is that the second offenses of the chronic inflammations of the reproductive organ are extremely frequent and it is to estimate this rate of second offense that the balance assessment will be remotely asked for more by the treatment or in 6 months.

This review will include all tests of initial assessment:

* A semen analysis (leukocytospermia)
* A measure of oxidative stress (8OHd guanosine assay - assay of protein carbonyl - DNA fragmentation)
* A seminal biochemistry (acid 1-4)alpha phosphatase, citrate, zinc, fructose, carnitine and glucosidase
* An ultrasound of the genital tract and genital tract RMI without injection of any compound

This visit will be scheduled for all patients, whether randomized or not. During this visit, the results of tests carried out at 1 month and 6 months after initiation of treatment will be analyzed. The investigator will collect adverse events that occurred since the randomization visit.

Patients who during the examination in 6 months have a very significant improvement in their semen parameters will propose cryopreserving their sperm.

Assays and analysis on the semen Collections of semen will be done in the Laboratory of Reproductive Biology of each participating centre of research.

Most assays and analysis will be centralized at the Cochin Hospital. Measurement of elastase Elastase assays will be centralized in the Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Hospital Cochin. The assays will be carried out from 150 µl total sperm collected after liquefaction and frozen at -20 ° C.

Migration Survival Test (MST) This test will be done locally in each participating centre. A smear slide will be made for a centralized analysis of the morphology, to avoid any ""centre"" effects.

Seminal Biochemistry The biochemical seminal will be centralized in the Laboratory of Biochemistry, Hospital Cochin. This assay, carried out on total sperm collected after liquefaction, including assays of acid phosphatase, citrate, zinc, fructose, carnitine and 1-4.alpha Glucosidase The semen will be collected, centrifuged at 600g for 5 minutes. After centrifugation, 500μl of the supernatant will be frozen at - 20 ° C and used for biochemical seminal.

Measurement of oxidative stress The extent of oxidative stress will be centrally assessed in Cochin Hospital. This assay, carried out on total sperm collected after liquefaction, including the determination of 8OHd-Guanosine, the dosage of protein carbonyl and DNA fragmentation.

The semen will be collected centrifuged at 600g for 5 minutes. After centrifugation:

* 250μl of the supernatant be frozen at - 20 ° C and used for determination of protein carbonyl.
* The pellet will be used for the assay of 8OHdguanosine and DNA fragmentation. Measurement of sperm motion parameters by CASA The measurement of sperm motion parameters by CASA will be performed locally in each participating centre.

Ultrasound and MRI of the genital tract Ultrasounds and MRI will be performed in the genital tract in the central radiology department of hospital Necker.

Conservation of the remaining sample of semen For patients with very significant improvement in their semen parameters during the examination at 6 months, it will be offered self-preservation of semen for any subsequent attempt of ART after the end of the study.

On the other hand, the remaining sample of semen, except if opposition from the patient, will be kept after the end of the research for later use in future research on fertility and inflammation. This collection will be kept at CECOS - Cochin Hospital, Bldg. Cassini - 27 rue du FAUBOURG St Jacques, 75014 Paris under the supervision of Professor Jean-PHILIPPE Wolf.

In 60% of cases a male factor is associated or is the main infertility factor. Inflammatory Syndrome (IS), characterized by the presence of a leukocytospermia is found in 12% of the cases. Leukocyte degranulation causes oxidative stress (OS) through the formation of free radicals attacking the sperm cell functions. HYPOTHESIS: To establish the responsibility of the IS, and OS, in chronicle inflammatory male infertility, the investigators hypothesize that its treatment (as well as its possible cause) must restore or improve the fertilizing capacity of patients sperm. METHODS: This prospective randomized study will test the response to the treatment. The investigators shall measure cellular degradation products due to the OS, thereby certifying that it does have a deleterious effect on sperm cell. Seminal biochemistry will also assess the impact of the syndrome on the genital tract glands and follow its evolution. The patients will be included in the study as soon as the leukocytospermia will be \> 0,5\*106/ml or as soon as the elastase will be \> 500 ng/mL.

Rush University Medical Center,OTHER,NCT04216784,Compare the Diuretic Effect With Furosemide vs Furosemide and Albumin Combined in Cirrhotic Patients,Comparison of Diuretic Effect With Furosemide Alone Versus the Combination of Furosemide and Albumin in Cirrhotic Patients,"A common complication of the progression of cirrhosis is fluid retention (ascites, edema, or pleural effusion). Loop diuretics are the treatment of choice for fluid retention in cirrhotic patients; however, many of these patients demonstrate diuretic resistance, requiring higher doses of the diuretics to achieve adequate diuresis. The cause of this diuretic resistance is hypothesized to be secondary to hypoalbuminemia which has led some providers to give human albumin in combination with loop diuretics to increase intravascular volume and facilitate diuresis. However, this practice remains controversial because minimal data exists to support its efficacy. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of diuretics alone versus diuretics in combination with albumin in cirrhotic patients presenting with fluid retention.","The purpose of this single center, prospective study is to compare the efficacy of two strategies for diuresis in patients with cirrhosis, the use of furosemide (Lasix®) alone versus the combination of furosemide (Lasix ®) and albumin (25%). The investigators will perform a single-center, prospective study with data collected as result of standard of care at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC).

Loop diuretics are the treatment of choice for fluid retention in cirrhotic patients; however, many of these patients demonstrate diuretic resistance, requiring higher doses of the diuretics to achieve adequate diuresis. The cause of this diuretic resistance is hypothesized to be secondary to hypoalbuminemia which has led some providers to give human albumin in combination with loop diuretics to increase intravascular volume and facilitate diuresis. However, this practice remains controversial because minimal data exists to support its efficacy. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of diuretics alone versus diuretics in combination with albumin in cirrhotic patients presenting with fluid retention. The purpose of this single center, prospective study is to compare the efficacy of two strategies for diuresis in patients with cirrhosis, the use of furosemide (Lasix®) alone versus the combination of furosemide (Lasix ®) and albumin (25%). The investigators will perform a single-center, prospective study with data collected as result of standard of care at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC). Patients who are 18 years of age and older, have diagnosed cirrhosis, and present to RUMC with fluid retention will be identified by the Hepatology and/or Surgery attending and be screened for inclusion in the study.

Cohort 1 will receive furosemide (Lasix) 40 to 80 mg intravenous push (IVP) twice a day (BID) for at least 48 hours and cohort 2 will receive combination of furosemide (Lasix) 40 to 80 mg IVP BID and albumin (25%) 12.5 grams BID for at least 48 hours.

Tacrolimus , another immunosuppressant, has been used in treatment of immune and inflammatory ocular diseases.This study describes a prospective controlled double-blinded randomized study of the clinical outcome of SS dry eyes patients treated with 0.03% tacrolimus eye drops. As secondary purposes, outcome of dry eye symptoms and any ocular symptoms of the eye drops were also questioned to the patients.","Aqueous deficiency dry eye is mainly caused by Sjogren syndrome (SS), an autoimmune, chronic, inflammatory and systemic disease which affects most commonly the lacrimal and salivary glands. The hyperreactivity of B lymphocytes causes lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, which induces production of antibodies against antigens of the acinar epithelium and ducts of the lacrimal exocrine gland . The ocular treatment is focused in increasing lubrification and decreasing inflammation with topical autologous serum, topical immunosuppressive agents and corticotherapy. Use of topical immunosuppressants has increased in recent years because the topical corticotherapy leads to ocular complications.

Among topical immunosuppressants the most used ones are tacrolimus, also known as FK506 and cyclosporine A (CsA). Their mechanism of action is similar, but FK 506 is described to be 10 to 100 times more potent than CsA. Tacrolimus is a macrolide with immunomodulatory action and becomes biologically active only when it binds to immunophilin and acts by inhibiting calcineurin, limiting transduction of the signal that carries information from the cell membrane to the nucleus, with the aim of stimulating interleukin (IL) - 2 synthesis, and inhibiting T and B lymphocyte activation .

In this way it is possible to know which embryo or embryos have greater implantantion capacity and will be transferred to the uterus to obtain a viable pregnancy. However, these observations can produce deleterious effects on embryo development due to changes in temperature, pH and osmolarity of the culture media, as well as a negative effect of direct light microscope for observation. This project aims to test the hypothesis that non-embryonic observation produces a beneficial effect on embryo quality until day 5 of development (blastocyst stage) and, therefore, on rates of implantation and ongoing gestation, compared with the conventional protocol of observations under the inverted microscope on days two, three and five of development.","The present study is a prospective double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) approved by a local Ethics Committe. Summarily, in the control group we did three embryo observations outside the incubator as we usually do in our conventional protocol: day 2, day 3 and day 5, just before ET; in the study group we performed a unique embryo observation on day 5 before ET. All the subjects that participated in the study were informed and gave us their consent to take part on it.

The inclusion criteria of the study were: first cycle of ART treatment with conventional IVF or ICSI with donated eggs, normal uterine cavity and a single or double embryo transfer, always performed on day 5 at blastocyst stage.

The exclusion criteria were the following: patients above 50 years old, patients that were diagnosed with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and/or recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) or uterine pathologies, body mass index \>30 kg/m2, the use of seminal samples coming from donors or testicular origin and cycles that included preimplantational genetic testing (PGT).

LBR was the main outcome of our study, defined as the number of deliveries that resulted in a live born neonate, expressed per 100 embryo transfers (Zegers- Hochschild et al., 2009). Secondary efficacy endpoints were positive hCG rate (\>5 mUI/mL, assessed in serum 14 days after oocyte retrieval), implantation rate (number of gestational sacs observed divided by the number of embryos transferred, expressed as a percentage, %), ongoing pregnancy rate, defined as a pregnancy with a detectable heart rate at 12 weeks of gestation or beyond and miscarriage (loss of a pregnancy after 12 weeks of gestation).

In addition, we assessed the next IVF laboratory parameters: fertilization rate, blastocyst formation rate on day 5, blastocyst quality, number of transferred embryos and number of usable blastocysts (number of blastocysts transferred and frozen).

The sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome. We assumed a live birth rate of 40% in the control group, compared to 50% in the non-observational group deduced from previous studies. By applicating the sample size calculation program, 776 patients (388 per group) were required in order to detect a risk difference (RD) of 10% between the two groups in the final analysis, with a power of 80% at a two-sided, adjusted alpha-level of 0.05.

Costs of health care consumption and sick leave 2006 in Sweden for Whiplash Associated Disorders (WAD) was estimated to be 4 billion Swedish crowns. Despite tremendous costs and personal sufferings there are only a few prospective randomized studies (RCT) in patients with chronic WAD, and none of them evaluating return to work, or the role of neck specific exercises with or without a combination of a behavioral approach compared with prescribed physical activity.

Aim:

The general aim of this RCT is to examine what neck-specific training with or without a combination with behavioral approach adds to prescribed physical activity of persons with chronic WAD with regard to pain intensity, physical and psychological function, health care consumption and return to work. Another aim is to study predictive factors of importance for a good outcome of rehabilitation.

Method:

After informed consent patients in age 18-63 years of age with WAD II-III with more than 6 months duration will be randomized to one out of the three alternatives of physiotherapy, treatment with medical exercise therapy with neck specific exercises (A),treatment with a behavioral approach combined with neck specific exercises (B), prescribed physical activity (C). Randomisation will be done by the central project leader. 200 patients will be included in the study.

"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",OTHER,NCT03904979,Therapeutic Writing to Reduce Stress,Writing to Reduce Stress in Expectant Moms: The RESet Study,"Purpose: The investigators hypothesize that exposure to chronic environmental stress is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes related to preterm birth and preeclampsia among high-risk pregnant women. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that women can be screened for high levels of environmental stress through the perceived stress scale, and therapeutic writing can be used as a low-resource intervention to help decrease maternal perceived stress and inflammation - measured through analysis of maternal serum and placental samples.

Participants: Pregnant women at high risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pre-eclampsia and preterm birth, enrolled in prenatal care at UNC will be recruited for participation

Procedures: Using results from the perceived stress scale, the investigators will identify women who screen positive for high environmental stress. Women meeting inclusion criteria will be contacted for possible participation at regularly scheduled prenatal visits. Women who are enrolled will be randomized to generalized writing prompts, therapeutic writing prompts, or no writing during their pregnancy to be administered at each prenatal visit. Maternal blood sample for biochemical markers of stress and gene expression will be obtained at the initial visit; a followup blood sample will be obtained later in pregnancy, and a small portion of the placenta saved at delivery. Delivery outcomes will be obtained through medical record review.","During pregnancy, women regularly interact with healthcare professionals, an often untapped resource and opportune time to optimize mental health, positively impacting outcomes. Cumulative psychosocial stress is a risk factor for several adverse obstetric outcomes including preterm birth (PTB), preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and postpartum depression.

The overarching hypothesis of this study is that pregnant women with high levels of stress can be identified through easily-implemented screening tools; importantly, the investigators propose that these women can be engaged in care via a cost-effective therapeutic writing intervention combined with the availability of expert pastoral and perinatal psychiatry resources.

Women will be enrolled early in pregnancy and followed prospectively. Some women (if randomized to a writing group) will complete a standardized writing prompt at several time points during gestation. The investigators will follow their outcomes prospectively.","Inclusion Criteria:

The study hypothesis is that intervention families will have lower (better) acute stress disorder scores when their child is discharged from the PICU and lower (better) post-traumatic stress disorder scores at 3-month follow-up, as compared to the control group families. The investigators will recruit 220 families (110 in each of the control and intervention groups). Families who are randomized to the intervention group will receive routine visits from members of the PACT (palliative care) team at least three times/week to address psychosocial needs, keep families informed about their child's health status, and offer emotional and instrumental support and resources. Families in the control group will receive usual care in the PICU. The intervention will end whenever the child is discharged from the PICU, which usually happens within 3 weeks of enrollment. The investigators will assess family outcomes at discharge from the PICU and 90 days after study enrollment. The investigators will conduct two additional activities to learn more about the processes of care for those in both the intervention and control groups. First, during the intervention, the investigators will recruit 30 families (15 in each group) and ask permission to audio-record the family care conferences to assess communication styles and gain greater insight into the differences in practice with or without the participation of the intervention team. The investigators will obtain additional consent from participants in these family conferences who are not otherwise enrolled in the study. Second, after completion of the 3-month follow-up interview, a sub-sample of a different 30 families (again, 15 in each group) will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews to debrief about their experience in the study and the intervention (for those in that group).

The study hypothesis is that intervention families will have lower (better) acute stress disorder scores when their child is discharged from the PICU and lower (better) post-traumatic stress disorder scores at 3-month follow-up, as compared to the control group families. The investigators will recruit 220 families (110 in each of the control and intervention groups). Families who are randomized to the intervention group will receive routine visits from members of the PACT (palliative care) team at least three times/week to address psychosocial needs, keep families informed about their child's health status, and offer emotional and instrumental support and resources. Families in the control group will receive usual care in the PICU. The intervention will end whenever the child is discharged from the PICU, which usually happens within 3 weeks of enrollment. The investigators will assess family outcomes at discharge from the PICU and 90 days after study enrollment. The investigators will conduct two additional activities to learn more about the processes of care for those in both the intervention and control groups. First, during the intervention, the investigators will recruit 30 families (15 in each group) and ask permission to audio-record the family care conferences to assess communication styles and gain greater insight into the differences in practice with or without the participation of the intervention team. The investigators will obtain additional consent from participants in these family conferences who are not otherwise enrolled in the study. Second, after completion of the 3-month follow-up interview, a sub-sample of a different 30 families (again, 15 in each group) will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews to debrief about their experience in the study and the intervention (for those in that group). This will be a one-time interview scheduled within 60 days of recruitment for this part of the project.

University of Georgia,OTHER,NCT03522779,Antioxidant Responses to Exercise and Cherry Consumption,Antioxidant Responses to Exercise and Cherry Consumption,"To date, there are no published studies on the effects of tart cherry consumption on postprandial antioxidant and oxidative stress levels following a high-fat meal. Further, no one has looked at the effects of prior exercise on a high-fat meal that includes high phytonutrients like tart cherries. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of tart cherry consumption on antioxidant and oxidative stress levels in human plasma after consumption of a high-fat meal, as well as the postprandial impact of prior exercise in combination with tart cherry consumption on a high-fat meal.","Study Design: This will be a single blinded, randomized, cross-over design in healthy humans. There will be four study visits for the four different treatments: 1) a high-fat meal alone, 2) a high-fat meal with tart cherry consumption, 3) prior exercise to a high-fat meal alone, and 4) prior exercise to a high-fat meal with tart cherry consumption. All participants will complete all 4 treatments in a random order. There will be a 7-day washout period between each visit.

Subjects: We will recruit 25 apparently healthy, physically active (structured exercise \> 3h/week) adult men, ages 18-30 years. All subjects will be normal weight based on body mass index (BMI = 18-24.9kg/m2) or body composition (14-24% body fat). The IRB proposal has been submitted and will be reviewed this month. The entire study will take place at the CTRU and sample analysis will take place in the Dept. of Food Science and Technology.

Protocol: For 24h prior to testing, participants will be provided with all food and beverages. This will allow us to control their antioxidant intake prior to testing. The lead-in diet will be representative of a standard American diet and be low in total antioxidants. Estimated total daily energy needs will be based on each participants predicted resting metabolic rate and multiplied by a moderate physical activity value (1.65). Participants will consume all foods that are provided and no additional foods or beverages, may be consumed. Participants will arrive at the CTRU at 0700 hours in the fasted state (no food or drink for 8-12h) and will have abstained from exercise for 48h, unless participating in one of the 2 exercise treatment visits. Baseline measurements of height, weight, blood pressure, and body fat percentage will be taken. An intravenous catheter will be placed in the antecubital vein and a baseline sample will be taken.

Participants will then complete a high-fat meal challenge, either with or without tart cherries depending on their treatment visit. The meals will have tart cherry juice or a placebo consumed with a high-fat meal. The placebo will be designed to match the tart cherry juice for volume and macronutrient content, but without the phytonutrient content of the tart cherries. The high-fat breakfast meal will be a Sausage Biscuit and Hash Browns (McDonalds Corporation). Blood draws will then be obtained at 1, 2 and 3 hours postprandially for antioxidant and oxidative stress measurements.

Acute Exercise Protocol: Two of the four treatments will include an acute bout of submaximal aerobic exercise performed 15 hours (1600 hours; 4:00p.m.) prior to the high-fat meal test. The exercise will consist of 30 minutes of treadmill running at 70% of each participants' calculated heart rate reserve (HRR). This will be a supervised session where participants will wear a heart rate monitor. Participants will also be asked to give their ratings of perceived exertion every 10 minutes during the exercise bout. Participants will be instructed to consume the dinner meal provided to them after this exercise session is complete, which will also be 8-12h prior to the high-fat meal test.

Sample Analysis: Plasma will be tested for total anthocyanins content by HPLC-UV/VIS as well as HPLC-ESI-MS. Antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress measurements will be performed by H-ORACFL and FRAP assays.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Males, 18-30 years old, with normal body weight based on body mass index (BMI=18-24.9kg/m2) or are of normal weight based on body composition analysis using the DXA (14-24% body fat). Must also participate in 3 or more hours per week of exercise with 1.5 or more of those hours being aerobic exercise.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Anyone with a chronic disease, medication use, digestive disorders, any supplement use, and anyone who will not consume tart cherry product.

Further, no one has looked at the effects of prior exercise on a high-fat meal that includes high phytonutrients like tart cherries. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of tart cherry consumption on antioxidant and oxidative stress levels in human plasma after consumption of a high-fat meal, as well as the postprandial impact of prior exercise in combination with tart cherry consumption on a high-fat meal. Study Design: This will be a single blinded, randomized, cross-over design in healthy humans. There will be four study visits for the four different treatments: 1) a high-fat meal alone, 2) a high-fat meal with tart cherry consumption, 3) prior exercise to a high-fat meal alone, and 4) prior exercise to a high-fat meal with tart cherry consumption. All participants will complete all 4 treatments in a random order. There will be a 7-day washout period between each visit. Subjects: We will recruit 25 apparently healthy, physically active (structured exercise \> 3h/week) adult men, ages 18-30 years. All subjects will be normal weight based on body mass index (BMI = 18-24.9kg/m2) or body composition (14-24% body fat). The IRB proposal has been submitted and will be reviewed this month. The entire study will take place at the CTRU and sample analysis will take place in the Dept. of Food Science and Technology. Protocol: For 24h prior to testing, participants will be provided with all food and beverages. This will allow us to control their antioxidant intake prior to testing. The lead-in diet will be representative of a standard American diet and be low in total antioxidants. Estimated total daily energy needs will be based on each participants predicted resting metabolic rate and multiplied by a moderate physical activity value (1.65). Participants will consume all foods that are provided and no additional foods or beverages, may be consumed. Participants will arrive at the CTRU at 0700 hours in the fasted state (no food or drink for 8-12h) and will have abstained from exercise for 48h, unless participating in one of the 2 exercise treatment visits. Baseline measurements of height, weight, blood pressure, and body fat percentage will be taken. An intravenous catheter will be placed in the antecubital vein and a baseline sample will be taken. Participants will then complete a high-fat meal challenge, either with or without tart cherries depending on their treatment visit. The meals will have tart cherry juice or a placebo consumed with a high-fat meal. The placebo will be designed to match the tart cherry juice for volume and macronutrient content, but without the phytonutrient content of the tart cherries. The high-fat breakfast meal will be a Sausage Biscuit and Hash Browns (McDonalds Corporation). Blood draws will then be obtained at 1, 2 and 3 hours postprandially for antioxidant and oxidative stress measurements. Acute Exercise Protocol: Two of the four treatments will include an acute bout of submaximal aerobic exercise performed 15 hours (1600 hours; 4:00p.m.) prior to the high-fat meal test. The exercise will consist of 30 minutes of treadmill running at 70% of each participants' calculated heart rate reserve (HRR). This will be a supervised session where participants will wear a heart rate monitor. Participants will also be asked to give their ratings of perceived exertion every 10 minutes during the exercise bout. Participants will be instructed to consume the dinner meal provided to them after this exercise session is complete, which will also be 8-12h prior to the high-fat meal test. Sample Analysis: Plasma will be tested for total anthocyanins content by HPLC-UV/VIS as well as HPLC-ESI-MS. Antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress measurements will be performed by H-ORACFL and FRAP assays. Inclusion Criteria: * Males, 18-30 years old, with normal body weight based on body mass index (BMI=18-24.9kg/m2) or are of normal weight based on body composition analysis using the DXA (14-24% body fat). Must also participate in 3 or more hours per week of exercise with 1.5 or more of those hours being aerobic exercise. Exclusion Criteria: * Anyone with a chronic disease, medication use, digestive disorders, any supplement use, and anyone who will not consume tart cherry product.

"University College, London",OTHER,NCT01882179,Early Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Treatment to Reduce Myocardial Infarct Size,MINeralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Pretreatment to MINIMISE Reperfusion Injury After ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI),"Heart attacks, or myocardial infarcts, are a major cause of death and disability in the UK. Immediate unblocking of the obstructed heart vessel with a balloon catheter and implantation of a mesh scaffold (stent) in heart centers is warranted in these patients. Morbidity and mortality in this patient group is related to the infarct size. Therefore, there is a need to discover novel therapeutic agents which reduce myocardial infarct size and preserve the contractile heart function.

Large trials involving several thousand patients have demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with impaired heart function due to a heart attack, who received a mineralo-corticoid receptor antagonist (MRA, drug name: spironolactone). In these trials patients received the drug late, 3-14 days after the heart attack.

Our proposal is to investigate whether MRA therapy administered intravenously prior to unblocking an occluded heart vessel, can reduce infarct size and as such can prevent long term sequelae of heart attacks.

150 patients admitted to 4 tertiary care hospitals (Heart Hospital London, London Chest, Essex Cardiothoracic Center and Leeds General Infirmary) for heart attack will be randomly assigned to receive MRA treatment or placebo. The first dose of the MRA will be applied intravenously immediately in the catheter suite, even before re-opening of the occluded vessel. From the second day on, patients will be prescribed oral MRA treatment, as a pill, for a total of three months. Before hospital discharge and after three months, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the heart will accurately investigate the evolution of infarct (scar) size and the contractile heart function and compare the group of patients who received the MRA drug versus the placebo control group. Of note, patients with an ejection fraction \<40% AND signs of heart failure OR diabetes will go on open label eplerenone according to current guidelines, instead of the study drug.

This study will give first evidence, if very early MRA treatment improves heart function and should be used as early as possible for treatment of patients after a heart attack.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Biological therapies, such as thalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. It may also stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with thalidomide and dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with thalidomide and dexamethasone works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the confirmed overall response rate (complete remission, remission, and partial remission) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone.
* Determine overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.
* Correlate, preliminarily, treatment with bortezomib with the activation of osteoblasts in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

* Induction therapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-21, and oral dexamethasone once daily on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. Treatment repeats every 21 days until achievement of confirmed complete remission (CR), remission (R), or partial remission (PR) OR for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients achieving confirmed CR, R, or PR who reach a plateau prior to receiving the maximum 8 courses of induction therapy OR who achieve confirmed CR, R, or PR after receiving the maximum 8 courses of induction therapy proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients achieving stable disease after receiving the maximum 8 courses of induction therapy either proceed to maintenance therapy or receive further treatment with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone off-study.

Information from existing databases and medical records will be used to obtain a list of phone numbers for persons who had roux-en-y bariatric surgery at the SVBCE five or more years ago at the St. Vincent Bariatric Center of Excellence (SVBCE. The interview includes scripts that the caller will use to recruit subjects in either direct conversation, in voice mail or by leaving a message. Recruitment will cease after 400 complete post pilot interviews are obtained. The interview covers topics related to physical and psychological health and quality of life. The number of questions asked will vary from subject to subject since some questions are asked only if a prior question is answered affirmatively. For example, if a subject responds ""yes"" when asked ""have you had plastic surgery?"" the subject is then asked what type of procedure they had. The topics covered are as follows: weight, current health, post surgery complications, relationships, work, cross addiction, mental health, diet, television viewing, exercise, and life satisfaction. Inclusion Criteria: * Bariatric surgery patients of the St. Vincent Bariatric Center of Excellence who had surgery at least 5 years before the survey was administered. Exclusion Criteria: * Patients having bariatric surgery at facilities other than St. Vincent Bariatric Center. * Patients who had bariatric surgery less than 5 years before the survey period."

Most common protocols recommend heparin infusions after surgery with transition to oral aspirin when oral intake begins. Patients at risk for thrombosis after congenital heart surgery requiring long-term antiplatelet therapy include those undergoing shunt placement for single-ventricle palliation or establishment of pulmonary blood flow, valve replacements, or coronary artery manipulation. Post-operative thrombosis after congenital heart surgery is rare, but thrombosis can result in death. The routine use of aspirin in these patients is intended to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences of thrombosis. However, there is no routine clinical assessment of the platelet inhibitory effect of aspirin; nor have there been any prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of aspirin's antiplatelet effect in children after congenital heart surgery. No data exists to suggest that the first dose of aspirin transition from heparin infusion is either sufficient or insufficient in its antiplatelet effect.

In this study, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the first aspirin dose in its antiplatelet effects after surgery for congenital heart disease. Degree of antiplatelet effect will be evaluated with thromboelastograph (TEG) and TEG-platelet mapping study analysis. Thromboelastography is a clinical laboratory method of assessing whole blood hemostasis and allows for assessment of clot formation, strength, and stability. TEG is most commonly used in patients at risk for bleeding or thrombosis and also to monitor antiplatelet therapies (such as aspirin).

The investigators hypothesize: the first dose of aspirin transitioned from heparin infusion after congenital heart surgery is sufficient in its antiplatelet effect as tested by TEG and TEG-platelet mapping studies.

Damascus University,OTHER,NCT02203279,Evaluation of Three Hard Relining Materials in Complete Dentures,Evaluation of Three Hard Relining Materials in Complete Dentures: An In-vivo Study,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate three hard relining materials after 3 and 6 months of use with mandibular complete dentures. The effect of hard relining materials on supporting tissues and patients' satisfaction will also be assessed.

Materials and Methods: 36 complete edentulous patients who already have maxillary dentures and complaining of instable mandibular dentures will be invited to participate in this study. Mandibular dentures will be relined randomly by one of three relining materials: two chairside relining materials (Tokuyama Rebase II Fast, Tokuyama Dental Co, Japan), and (Flexacryl Hard, Lang Co, USA) and one heat cured acrylic resin (Vertex, Dental technology Co, Holland).

The color stability of relining material, peeling, and the effect on supporting tissue will be assessed by two separate prosthodontists after 3 and 6 months of follow up. In addition, patients will be asked to grade there overall satisfaction on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100.","Relining denture is a process of resurfacing the tissue side of a denture to make it fit more accurately Direct relining of removable dentures with hard chair-side reline materials is suitable for improving the fit of the denture bases to the supporting tissues. Chairside reline materials are more convenient than those processed in a laboratory because the direct method is faster and does not cause clinically significant dimensional changes of the reline resin. However, when autopolymerized reline resins are used with a direct method, several problems can occur as burning sensation caused by monomers, an exothermic heat reaction and an unpleasant odor.

There are three types of hard relining chair-side materials: Dual-polymerized Visible light-polymerized as Triad DuaLine, Light Liner (Hard), Astron LC (Hard).Visible light-polymerized as Lightdon-U, Triad Hi-Flow Reline Material, Triad VLC Reline Material. Finally, autopolymerized as New Truline, Tokuyama Rebase II (Fast) , GC Reline. Other concerns related to direct reline materials include patient tolerance (taste, temperature, odor), color stability, durability and ease of handling and polishing.

Few studies evaluated the effect of disinfection solutions on relining materials properties as roughness and hardness. In one study, disinfectant solutions caused a decrease in hardness, whereas with roughness, the materials tested showed a statistically significant increase, except for Tokuyama. Depending on the examined relining materials, some materials have increased and the others have decreased surface roughness after immersion in disinfecting solutions or microwave disinfection.

All previous laboratory studies concentrated on the effects of disinfection on relining materials properties as roughness, hardness, color change. However, the clinical studies did not compare chemically cured and heat cured relining materials and their effects on supporting tissue. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of two -chemically cured- and heat cured denture relining material after 3 and 6 months of use. In addition, the effect of hard relining materials on supporting tissues, and patients' satisfaction has not been evaluated yet.","Inclusion Criteria:

Materials and Methods: 36 complete edentulous patients who already have maxillary dentures and complaining of instable mandibular dentures will be invited to participate in this study. Mandibular dentures will be relined randomly by one of three relining materials: two chairside relining materials (Tokuyama Rebase II Fast, Tokuyama Dental Co, Japan), and (Flexacryl Hard, Lang Co, USA) and one heat cured acrylic resin (Vertex, Dental technology Co, Holland). The color stability of relining material, peeling, and the effect on supporting tissue will be assessed by two separate prosthodontists after 3 and 6 months of follow up. In addition, patients will be asked to grade there overall satisfaction on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100. Relining denture is a process of resurfacing the tissue side of a denture to make it fit more accurately Direct relining of removable dentures with hard chair-side reline materials is suitable for improving the fit of the denture bases to the supporting tissues. Chairside reline materials are more convenient than those processed in a laboratory because the direct method is faster and does not cause clinically significant dimensional changes of the reline resin. However, when autopolymerized reline resins are used with a direct method, several problems can occur as burning sensation caused by monomers, an exothermic heat reaction and an unpleasant odor. There are three types of hard relining chair-side materials: Dual-polymerized Visible light-polymerized as Triad DuaLine, Light Liner (Hard), Astron LC (Hard).Visible light-polymerized as Lightdon-U, Triad Hi-Flow Reline Material, Triad VLC Reline Material. Finally, autopolymerized as New Truline, Tokuyama Rebase II (Fast) , GC Reline. Other concerns related to direct reline materials include patient tolerance (taste, temperature, odor), color stability, durability and ease of handling and polishing. Few studies evaluated the effect of disinfection solutions on relining materials properties as roughness and hardness. In one study, disinfectant solutions caused a decrease in hardness, whereas with roughness, the materials tested showed a statistically significant increase, except for Tokuyama. Depending on the examined relining materials, some materials have increased and the others have decreased surface roughness after immersion in disinfecting solutions or microwave disinfection. All previous laboratory studies concentrated on the effects of disinfection on relining materials properties as roughness, hardness, color change. However, the clinical studies did not compare chemically cured and heat cured relining materials and their effects on supporting tissue. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of two -chemically cured- and heat cured denture relining material after 3 and 6 months of use. In addition, the effect of hard relining materials on supporting tissues, and patients' satisfaction has not been evaluated yet.

Moreover, the effects of such alternative interventions should be objectively quantified by means of reliable psychobiological parameters.

The goal of this study was to quantify the acute and persistent effects of a cosmetic routine based on the self-administration of a cream (DAVC) enriched with essential oils, namely Juniperus Phoenicea gum extract, Copaifera Officinalis resin, Aniba Rosodora wood oil, Juniperus Virginiana. This aim was achieved by measuring the (re-)activity of the autonomic nervous system (via heart variability indexes) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (via salivary cortisol levels), as well as through psychometric and behavioral assessments.

Fourty women, 25-50 years old, were instructed for a correct mode of self administration of the cream. On day 0, women came to the lab and were instrumented for electrocardiographic signal (ECG) recordings. Initially, a 10-min ECG was collected in resting conditions (baseline). Then, two 20-min ECGs were recorded, each following the self-administration (3-min duration) of the DAVC and a placebo cream (PLAC), in a randomized order. At the end of the baseline and the two post-cream administration recordings, saliva samples were collected. From day 1 to 28, subjects self-administered (at home, twice a day, at wake-up and bed time) either DAVC (n=20) or PLAC (n=20).

On day 29, they returned to the lab and ECGs and underwent a stress test (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). The test lasted 10 min and consisted in a stress interview (5 min), immediately followed by an arithmetic task. ECGs were collected in baseline (10 min), test (10 min), and recovery (20 min) phases. Saliva samples were collected at the end of the baseline and the middle and the end of the recovery phase. The subjects filled a number of psychological questionnaires, including Profile of Mood States (POMS, on day 0 and 29) and STAI-Y1 (on day 29). In addition, subjects were videorecorded during the TSST, in order to quantify their non verbal behavior patterns (via ECSI).

A single, self-administration of DAVC (day 0) produced a significant, acute potentiation of parasympathetic neural modulation (HF index: 25% increase as to baseline), whereas PLAC produced only a modest change (3% increase). DAVC provoked a modest (10%), non significant reduction of cortisol levels, which was similar to that induced by PLAC.

Prolonged DAVC self-administration (4 weeks) produced: (i) a significant inhibition of stress-induced cortisol elevation on day 29 (55% increase as compared to pre-stress value in DAVC group, 75% in PLAC group); (ii) a significant improvement of mood profile (POMS test) on day 29 compared to day 0; (iii) a reduction of perceived anxiety (STAI-Y1 score) at the end of the TSST; (iv) significantly lower scores of behavioral patterns linked to anxiety, motivational conflict and avoidance and higher scores of affiliation during the TSST, as compared to PLAC group.

These autonomic neural, neuroendocrine and psychological data suggest that a cream enriched with essential oils has both acute and long-term stress-reduction effects on human psychophysiology. Acute effects involve a potentiation of the parasympathetic component of autonomic neural regulation, which is usually associated with well-being, relaxation and resilience. The long-term effects point to a generalized stress-relief property, involving both the hormonal and psychological sides of stress adaptation.","Inclusion Criteria:

Aga Khan University,OTHER,NCT03594279,Community Mobilization and Incentivization for Childhood Diarrhea and Pneumonia,Evaluation of a Community Engagement and Demand Creation Strategy for Childhood Diarrhea and Pneumonia in Pakistan,Childhood diarrhea and pneumonia remains the leading cause of mortality among children under five years of age in Pakistan. The prevalence of diarrhea in Pakistan has increased from 15% in 1990 to 23% in 2013 while there has been no progress in the prevalence of pneumonia and it has been almost constant over the last two decades. The coverage of preventive and therapeutic interventions for childhood diarrhea and pneumonia also remains low. This study aims to improve the adherence to recommended preventive and curative practices for childhood diarrhea and pneumonia.,"Study Components and Objectives:

This study will be conducted in two phases:

1. Formative phase: The objective of this phase is to assess the existing care seeking practices and care provision for childhood diarrhea and pneumonia and identify the existing barriers and facilitators for care seeking for childhood diarrhea and pneumonia.
2. Cluster Randomized Trial: (CoMIC Trial - Community Mobilization and Community Incentivization): The objective of this phase is to assess the impact of a community engagement and demand creation strategy involving an community-based incentive scheme on adherence to recommended preventive and curative practices for diarrhea and pneumonia among children under five years of age.

Study site: This study will be conducted in Tando Muhammad Khan, which is a rural district in the province of Sindh. This would a three and half year study with two year of intervention period.

Study design: This study will follow a mixed methodology approach with a formative research component followed by a prospective two arm cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT).

Formative Phase: The following activities will be conducted in the formative phase:

* GIS Mapping: for the whole district to map all the government health facilities, schools, major religious places (mosques), water supply sources and roads.
* Qualitative research: comprising of focus group discussion (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with all stakeholders. These would also identify the potential non-cash incentives that the community wants and could be attractive
* Baseline Household Survey: Baseline survey will be conducted at the household level and will gather information on health care practices pertaining to childhood diarrhea and pneumonia, immunization, socio-economic indicators, childhood nutrition indicators and WASH indicators. LHWs working in the study area and their geographic spread will also be identified.

Randomized Controlled Trial:

-Randomization: After the mapping and formative research, the clusters (villages) will be randomly allocated to two intervention arms and a control arm by an independent statistician in the ratio of 1:1:1.

Sample size: The sample size was calculated with a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05 giving 14 clusters per arm (maximum sample size). These clusters will be randomly allocated to three arms.

Intervention:

Arm 1: In Arm 1, separate male and female village committees (VC) consisting of prominent members of the community including local elites/leaders (6 to 8 in a group) in all the villages will be formed and they would be trained on specific messages regarding the prevention and management of childhood diarrhea and pneumonia. The VCs would carry out awareness and motivational activities for the uptake of the identified interventions. They would also facilitate two hour group meetings to be held twice every month in every village of their catchment area and focus on issues pertaining to childhood nutrition, WASH, vaccines and management of diarrhea and pneumonia in children. Apart from these, there would researcher led awareness sessions in this intervention cluster and specific sessions for children would also be conducted. These sessions would focus on providing education and encourage community participation. Group activities would also identify community level health, nutrition and sanitation problems, and to find locally feasible strategies to address them.

Arm 2: In the second intervention cluster; in addition to the interventions in Arm 1, the areas which improve the practices for preventive and curative strategies for diarrhea and pneumonia will receive community-based incentive. This would be a unique incentive scheme as all the previous financial incentive programs whether conditional or unconditional cash transfers, voucher schemes, social insurance schemes have targeted individuals and all these incentives were based on improving individual practices. The financial incentive proposed is unique as this initiative which would benefit the community as a whole and incentives based on improvement in the composite coverage of three indicators:

* Age-appropriate immunization 12-23 months
* ORS use for diarrhea
* Sanitation index (which is a score based on personal, household and environmental hygiene) The incentives would include structural benefits linked to health including tube wells, water supply, toilets in community/schools, water storage facility or any other incentive as decided with the respective village committees. The total cost of these incentives would be shared by the project (75%) and the community (25%), to improve ownership. The contribution from the community could also be in-kind including labor etc.

Arm 3: This arm will receive routine standard of care.","Inclusion Criteria:

Formative Phase: The following activities will be conducted in the formative phase: * GIS Mapping: for the whole district to map all the government health facilities, schools, major religious places (mosques), water supply sources and roads. * Qualitative research: comprising of focus group discussion (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with all stakeholders. These would also identify the potential non-cash incentives that the community wants and could be attractive * Baseline Household Survey: Baseline survey will be conducted at the household level and will gather information on health care practices pertaining to childhood diarrhea and pneumonia, immunization, socio-economic indicators, childhood nutrition indicators and WASH indicators. LHWs working in the study area and their geographic spread will also be identified. Randomized Controlled Trial: -Randomization: After the mapping and formative research, the clusters (villages) will be randomly allocated to two intervention arms and a control arm by an independent statistician in the ratio of 1:1:1. Sample size: The sample size was calculated with a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05 giving 14 clusters per arm (maximum sample size). These clusters will be randomly allocated to three arms. Intervention: Arm 1: In Arm 1, separate male and female village committees (VC) consisting of prominent members of the community including local elites/leaders (6 to 8 in a group) in all the villages will be formed and they would be trained on specific messages regarding the prevention and management of childhood diarrhea and pneumonia. The VCs would carry out awareness and motivational activities for the uptake of the identified interventions. They would also facilitate two hour group meetings to be held twice every month in every village of their catchment area and focus on issues pertaining to childhood nutrition, WASH, vaccines and management of diarrhea and pneumonia in children. Apart from these, there would researcher led awareness sessions in this intervention cluster and specific sessions for children would also be conducted. These sessions would focus on providing education and encourage community participation. Group activities would also identify community level health, nutrition and sanitation problems, and to find locally feasible strategies to address them. Arm 2: In the second intervention cluster; in addition to the interventions in Arm 1, the areas which improve the practices for preventive and curative strategies for diarrhea and pneumonia will receive community-based incentive. This would be a unique incentive scheme as all the previous financial incentive programs whether conditional or unconditional cash transfers, voucher schemes, social insurance schemes have targeted individuals and all these incentives were based on improving individual practices. The financial incentive proposed is unique as this initiative which would benefit the community as a whole and incentives based on improvement in the composite coverage of three indicators: * Age-appropriate immunization 12-23 months * ORS use for diarrhea * Sanitation index (which is a score based on personal, household and environmental hygiene) The incentives would include structural benefits linked to health including tube wells, water supply, toilets in community/schools, water storage facility or any other incentive as decided with the respective village committees. The total cost of these incentives would be shared by the project (75%) and the community (25%), to improve ownership. The contribution from the community could also be in-kind including labor etc. Arm 3: This arm will receive routine standard of care. Inclusion Criteria: * People residing in the villages in the selected study site and consent to participate. Exclusion Criteria: -"
Baylor College of Medicine,OTHER,NCT00458679,Treatment of B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) With Autologous CD40 Ligand and IL-2-Expressing Tumor Cells,Prolonged Immunization With Autologous CD40 Ligand and IL-2-Expressing Tumor Cells for Treatment of B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL),"We would like patients to be in a research study to determine the safety and effectiveness of special cells that may make their own immune system fight their cancer.

To do this, we will put a special gene into cancer cells that have been taken from the patients body. This will be done in the laboratory. This gene will make the cells produce interleukin 2 (IL-2), which is a natural substance that may help their immune system kill cancer cells. Additionally, we will stimulate the cancer cells with normal embryonic fibroblasts (cells that develop into normal connective tissues in the body) so that they will make another natural protein called CD40 ligand (CD40L). Studies of cancers in animals suggest IL-2 performs better when mixed with CD40L.

Some of these cells will then be put back into the patients body with the goal that they will act like a vaccine and stimulate their immune system to attack the CLL cells. Studies of cancers in animals and in cancer cells that are grown in laboratories suggest that combining substances like IL-2 and CD40L with cancer cells help the body recognize and kill cancer cells. We have already conducted a study similar to this in patients with CLL. In that study, the subjects received about three months of injections (shots). In those subjects we saw some changes in the subject's immune system that might indicate that the modified cells were helping their immune system fight the cancer. However, in most of the subjects this change in the immune system went away after the injections were stopped.

In this study we want to see if we can make the change in the immune system last longer by giving more injections over a longer period of time. We hope that this might produce a better response directed at the CLL cells. We will also be looking at the effect on cells called cancer stem cells which grow into the CLL cells we see in the blood. Specifically, this study will allow subjects to receive the injections for up to one year.","Previously, some of the cancer cells taken from the patients body were separated in the laboratory and a specially produced human virus (adenovirus) that carries the IL-2 gene was put into the cells. Adenovirus is a common virus found in human respiratory systems. In its normal state, it can reproduce and cause a respiratory infection. Respiratory illnesses caused by adenovirus infections range from the common cold to pneumonia, croup and bronchitis. This adenovirus has been changed in the laboratory so that it is not likely to reproduce or cause an infection once it is in the patients body. The gene transfer method used in this study tries to add copies of the IL2 gene that increases the immune response against a tumor.

The rest of the cancer cells have been stimulated to express on their surface a substance called the human CD40L. These substances (IL-2 and CD40L), already naturally present in the patients body, are meant to help the immune system fight the cancer. In this study, the modified cancer cells will be injected under the skin. The patient will normally have the shots as an outpatient. The patient will receive the first eight (8) shots at 1-2 week intervals. They will then receive four (4) shots at 4 weekly intervals. After these first twelve shots, we will assess how the cancer is responding to these modified cells. If the cancer is not getting worse, the patient may receive an additional six (6) shots. These shots will again be given at 4 weekly intervals. In total, the patient may receive up to eighteen (18) shots over a period of one year. These shots must be given at the Methodist Hospital. Following these injections, the patient will be seen yearly for check-ups for 2 years after the first injection.

TESTS DURING AND AFTER EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT:

A complete history and physical examination is necessary before the patient can be enrolled in the study. A physical examination will also be performed each time they are receive a shot of the modified cells. The place on the body where the patient has received their shots will be examined during the physical exam.

As mentioned above, the patient will then have yearly checkups for the 2 years after the first injection. After this, we will call the patients physician for updates on the patients health. These calls will be made annually until 5 years after the first injection.

To study how the modified cells are working in the body, we will take blood samples prior to each shot, then every four weeks for six months after the last injection, and then 2 years after the first injection.

The amount of blood that will be obtained for these tests is approximately 2-3 tablespoonfuls, which is considered to be a safe amount. If the patient has a central line (an IV line that has been placed in a large blood vessel that is meant to be used for long periods of time), the blood will be taken from it, so that extra ""sticks"" should not be needed. Additional office visits may be necessary to obtain this blood. The maximum total amount of blood to be collected from the patient is 78 tablespoons.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

University of Michigan,OTHER,NCT02069379,Endogenous Opioid Activity and Affective State in Insulin Resistant Women,Endogenous Opioid Activity and Affective State in Insulin Resistant Women,"Insulin resistance, a primary component of the metabolic syndrome, is an escalating phenomenon in the United States, and confers an increased risk of depression and mood disorder, particularly in women. The relationship between metabolic and mood disorders may be mediated by endogenous opioid activity in limbic brain regions. We propose to examine affective state and μ- opioid system function in insulin resistant women, and change in response to insulin sensitizing treatment, through the following specific aims and hypotheses:

Establish relationship between insulin resistance, affective state, and μ-opioid receptor function.

1. Insulin resistant women will have greater μ-opioid receptor availability at baseline, and a larger response to stress challenge than non-insulin resistant women
2. Insulin resistant women will have greater negative affective state at baseline, and a greater emotional response to stress challenge than non-insulin resistant women.
3. Mediational analyses will reveal that the relationship between insulin resistance and negative affect is mediated by μ-opioid receptor function and neural activation in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens affect-regulating regions.

Examine effects of insulin regulation on μ-opioid receptor function and affective state.

1. Improved insulin sensitivity will be accompanied by decreased μ-opioid receptor availability at baseline and a reduced response to stress challenge. Degree of change in baseline receptor availability and response to stress challenge after treatment will correlate with degree of insulin regulation.
2. Improved insulin sensitivity will be associated with improved affective state at baseline, and with a reduced emotional response to stress challenge. Degree of change in affective state and emotional response to stress challenge after treatment will correlate with degree of insulin regulation.
3. Mediational analyses will reveal that the change in affective state after insulin regulation is mediated by change in μ-opioid receptor function and neural activation in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens.

The expected results would suggest a role for the endogenous μ-opioid system in mediating the relationship between metabolic function and emotional processes.","The objective of this study is to examine the role of the endogenous mu-opioid system in mediating the relationship between metabolic dysfunction and depressive symptoms in reproductive aged women.

PET image data was unable to be analyzed due to PET equipment replacement midway through study, leaving PET images collected at beginning of study incompatible with PET images collected later in study.

Due to insufficient enrollment in treatment arms, the 20 or 40 week data was unusable for analytic goals, so the study was re-framed for what could usefully be learned about baseline characteristics among the study populations and the originally planned outcome measures were amended to only to those that related to understanding the baseline population.","Inclusion Criteria:

The relationship between metabolic and mood disorders may be mediated by endogenous opioid activity in limbic brain regions. We propose to examine affective state and μ- opioid system function in insulin resistant women, and change in response to insulin sensitizing treatment, through the following specific aims and hypotheses: Establish relationship between insulin resistance, affective state, and μ-opioid receptor function. 1. Insulin resistant women will have greater μ-opioid receptor availability at baseline, and a larger response to stress challenge than non-insulin resistant women 2. Insulin resistant women will have greater negative affective state at baseline, and a greater emotional response to stress challenge than non-insulin resistant women. 3. Mediational analyses will reveal that the relationship between insulin resistance and negative affect is mediated by μ-opioid receptor function and neural activation in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens affect-regulating regions. Examine effects of insulin regulation on μ-opioid receptor function and affective state. 1. Improved insulin sensitivity will be accompanied by decreased μ-opioid receptor availability at baseline and a reduced response to stress challenge. Degree of change in baseline receptor availability and response to stress challenge after treatment will correlate with degree of insulin regulation. 2. Improved insulin sensitivity will be associated with improved affective state at baseline, and with a reduced emotional response to stress challenge. Degree of change in affective state and emotional response to stress challenge after treatment will correlate with degree of insulin regulation. 3. Mediational analyses will reveal that the change in affective state after insulin regulation is mediated by change in μ-opioid receptor function and neural activation in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens. The expected results would suggest a role for the endogenous μ-opioid system in mediating the relationship between metabolic function and emotional processes. The objective of this study is to examine the role of the endogenous mu-opioid system in mediating the relationship between metabolic dysfunction and depressive symptoms in reproductive aged women. PET image data was unable to be analyzed due to PET equipment replacement midway through study, leaving PET images collected at beginning of study incompatible with PET images collected later in study. Due to insufficient enrollment in treatment arms, the 20 or 40 week data was unusable for analytic goals, so the study was re-framed for what could usefully be learned about baseline characteristics among the study populations and the originally planned outcome measures were amended to only to those that related to understanding the baseline population.

The investigators will test the hypothesise that a higher resistance exercise frequency will result in greater muscle protein synthesis rates than a lower resistance exercise frequency.,"Resistance exercise is currently the most effective means of building or maintaining muscle mass. Resistance exercise guidelines generally suggest that those looking to increase muscle mass should train each muscle group once to twice per week.

Hong Kong Baptist University,OTHER,NCT05266079,Comparison Study for Perimenopausal Syndrome With Chinese Herbal Medicine,Comparison Study of the Effectiveness Between Syndrome Differentiation Treatments and Fixed Formula Treatment for Perimenopausal Syndrome With Chinese Herbal Medicine,"Background: Perimenopausal syndrome (PMS) refers to a series of symptoms caused by the dynamic fluctuations of sex hormones during menopause. Menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, vaginal dryness and mood swings are experienced by about 80% of Chinese women aged 45 to 60. In the past year, 235 patients visited CMCTR(ND), a TCM center set up by HA and operated by HKFTU Workers' Medical Clinics since 2008, suffered from PMS.

According to literature review, high proportion of clinical trials regarding perimenopausal women used fixed formula treatment. However, different constitutional types were found in perimenopausal women and different fixed formulae were used in different research. Apart from kidney yin deficiency, perimenopausal women were also found in liver-kidney yin deficiency, kidney yang deficiency, kidney yin and yang deficiency, disharmony between heart and kidney, liver qi stagnation, etc. It is difficult to draw a conclusion that any single fixed formula could have the best efficacy on PMS. Therefore, it is worth studying to see whether syndrome differentiation would be a better choice for PMS treatment.

Objective: The study aims to evaluate whether syndrome differentiated treatment is better than fixed formula (Er-Xian decoction) treatment for perimenopausal women.

Design: This is a pilot single-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Participants: Chinese women aged 45-55 year with menstruation abnormalities (menstrual irregularity in past 12 months; or menstrual period off at least twice in past 12 months; or amenorrhea of 2 to 12 months); also suffering any following perimenopausal symptoms: vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, sweats), psychological symptoms (insomnia, migraine, irritability), or genitourinary symptoms (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia)

Interventions: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of syndrome differentiated treatment versus a fixed formula (Er-Xian decoction) in treating PMS. 100 participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Intervention group of participants will be given medication by syndrome differentiating from qualified TCM Practitioners while the control group of participants will be given a fixed formula.

Outcome measures: Primary assessments outcome measure is the Kupperman Index, and the secondary outcome measure is MENQOL questionnaire.","Perimenopausal syndrome is also known as menopausal syndrome. Menopause Syndrome refers to women due to ovarian dysfunction or loss of estrogen causing a variety of systemic dysfunctions in the body, including the autonomic nervous system, dysfunction and metabolic disorders-based symptoms such as hot flushes and sweating, sleep disorders, depression, multiple joint pains, headache, dizziness, fatigue, etc. These symptoms seriously affect menopausal women . Modern medical treatment of perimenopausal syndrome mainly focus on Hormonal Therapy (HT). Studies have shown that the clinical effect of hormonal therapy would quickly relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal syndrome, including urogenital atrophy and prevention of osteoporosis .

However there were some scholars believed that although short-term use of hormone supplement therapy could relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal women, the role of estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women still needed to be further explored . The reason was that hormonal replacement therapy can cause more adverse reactions and potential risks such as increased cardiovascular disease, cerebral infarction, breast-related diseases, risk of embolism in veins and lungs and other diseases .

In the previous study, the investigators found that the Chinese herbal formula Er-Xian decoction was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency and severity of hot flushes and in relieving menopausal symptoms in Hong Kong perimenopausal women. It was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events noted during the study period. The study proved the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. The investigators designed this experiment in order to further understand the effectiveness between syndrome differentiation treatment and fixed prescription.

Syndrome differentiation and treatment is the process of recognizing and resolving diseases, the embodiment of the combination of theory and practice, the specific clinical application of principles and methods, and the basic principles guiding the clinical work of traditional Chinese medicine. Dialectics is the process of authentication. Syndrome is a summary of the pathological reflections of the body through four diagnostic methods (inspection, listening and smelling, inquiries, and palpation ). It would help to establish disease stages, including the location of disease, cause, nature, and relationship between healthy qi and pathogenic qi. Therefore, the syndrome would reveal the essence of the disease, and therefore enhance the disease management. Corresponding treatment method is determined based on the result of syndrome differentiation. Syndrome differentiation and treatment are two inseparable parts in the process of diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

There is no record of the term of the perimenopausal syndrome in the ancient Chinese medicine books. The investigators can find some similar symptoms recorded in ""Lily Disease"" , ""Hysteria"", and ""Insomnia""or ""Depression"" and other diseases in ancient books. Modern Chinese medicine gynecology calls it ""Premenopausal"". Traditional Chinese medicine believes that in perimenopausal women, the kidney qi is gradually declining. Dysfunction of qi and blood is mainly caused by kidney deficiency. Among them, the syndrome of kidney yin deficiency is the most common. According to the literature, the syndrome types are divided as follows:

1. Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency Syndrome: Before and after menstruation, the essence and blood are weak, or the body is in yin deficiency, yin does not guard the yang, yang is disturbed. Clinical symptoms include sweating, hot flushes, insomnia, forgetfulness, backache and weak legs, dry genitals, menstrual disorders, red tongue with less coating, pulse is rapid and thready. Suggested Formula: Gan Mai Bai He Di Hung Tang
2. Non Interaction Between Heart and Kidney:The woman's yin and yang are imbalanced, the yin essence is deficient, and the kidney yin deficiency and water does not nourish the wood, causing the liver fire to become prosperous. Common clinical symptoms include hot flush, sweating, palpitation, irritability, bitter mouth, dry mouth, red tongue with thin yellow coating, pulse is thready and rapid. Suggested formula: Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan
3. Liver stagnation and qi stagnation syndrome: Chest tightness, hypotension, chest pain, mental depression, nervousness, abdominal pain, flushing, nervousness, petechial, chord pulse. Suggested formula: Shugan Granules (Danzhi Xiaoyao San without Ginger add Xiangfu)
4. Kidney Yin Deficiency Syndrome: Fever, sweating, upset, Insomnia, dry mouth, ant feeling on the skin, early menstruation. Suggested formula: Liu Wei Di Huang Pill and Er Zhi Pill

University Hospital Tuebingen,OTHER,NCT03227484,Effect of Empagliflozin Versus Placebo on Brain Insulin Sensitivity in Patients With Prediabetes,A Double-blind Randomized Study to Determine the Effect of Empagliflozin Versus Placebo on Brain Insulin Sensitivity in Patients With Prediabetes,"Recently, various sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Empagliflozin is a preparation of this class of substances. SGLT2 inhibitors also lead to a reduction in body weight in addition to their blood glucose lowering effect. The basis for this is probably the calorie loss by the increased glucose excretion over the urine. However, this weight-reducing effect is lost after a few weeks of treatment and the body weight subsequently stabilizes at a lower level than before. However, patients continue to lose energy via the urine. Hence, the weight stabilization could be due to an increased energy intake as a possible consequence of a changed brain setpoint for the body weight. As the main weight loss is achieved during the first 6-8 weeks of treatment, the investigators assume that the underlying central nervous mechanisms will be present after this time.

Furthermore, clinical-experimental observations show that treatment with empagliflozin promotes endogenous glucose production in the liver. This presumably compensatory mechanism also occurs after only a few weeks of treatment. The common mechanism, which could be based both on energy intake and on the endogenous glucose production effect, is still unclear. The investigators suspect that regulatory circuits in the brain contribute to these observed effects.

In fact, several studies in animals as well as initial clinical studies in humans show that the brain is involved in eating behavior and peripheral metabolism. In particular, effects of the hormone insulin modulate the dietary intake via the brain, thereby affecting human body weight.

Many of the experiments on the insulin sensitivity of the human brain used a specific approach to the selective delivery of insulin into the brain: the application of insulin as a nasal spray. Although this application route has no therapeutic value, this technique allows the administration of insulin to the central nervous system with little effect on the circulating insulin levels. By combining nasal insulin administration with functional MRI, regional insulin sensitivity of the brain can be quantified. The investigators recently found that the insulin action of the brain (stimulated by nasal insulin) regulates both endogenous glucose production and peripheral glucose uptake during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamps. The signals from the brain seem to reach the periphery via the autonomic nervous system in order to modulate metabolic processes. A central brain area in this regard is the hypothalamus. This brain region receives afferents over various systems such as the autonomic nervous system and various endocrine systems (including insulin). The investigators recently characterized the hypothalamus as an insulin-sensitive brain area in humans. The hypothalamus is the key area for homeostatic control throughout the body.

Since the dietary intake and the endogenous glucose production are modulated by a hypothalamic insulin effect in humans, we suspect that the observed effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on both processes could be due to altered insulin activity in the brain. Since the SGLT2 inhibition by empagliflozin modulates the autonomic nervous system in the kidneys, signals from the kidney may be transmitted to the brain via the autonomic nervous system, thereby changing specific setpoints, including e.g. insulin sensitivity of the brain.

In order to test this hypothesis, a precise phenotyping of prediabetic volunteers with regard to regional brain insulin sensitivity as well as the brain effect on metabolism before and after 8 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin compared to placebo is planned.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Empagliflozin is a preparation of this class of substances. SGLT2 inhibitors also lead to a reduction in body weight in addition to their blood glucose lowering effect. The basis for this is probably the calorie loss by the increased glucose excretion over the urine. However, this weight-reducing effect is lost after a few weeks of treatment and the body weight subsequently stabilizes at a lower level than before. However, patients continue to lose energy via the urine. Hence, the weight stabilization could be due to an increased energy intake as a possible consequence of a changed brain setpoint for the body weight. As the main weight loss is achieved during the first 6-8 weeks of treatment, the investigators assume that the underlying central nervous mechanisms will be present after this time. Furthermore, clinical-experimental observations show that treatment with empagliflozin promotes endogenous glucose production in the liver. This presumably compensatory mechanism also occurs after only a few weeks of treatment. The common mechanism, which could be based both on energy intake and on the endogenous glucose production effect, is still unclear. The investigators suspect that regulatory circuits in the brain contribute to these observed effects. In fact, several studies in animals as well as initial clinical studies in humans show that the brain is involved in eating behavior and peripheral metabolism. In particular, effects of the hormone insulin modulate the dietary intake via the brain, thereby affecting human body weight. Many of the experiments on the insulin sensitivity of the human brain used a specific approach to the selective delivery of insulin into the brain: the application of insulin as a nasal spray. Although this application route has no therapeutic value, this technique allows the administration of insulin to the central nervous system with little effect on the circulating insulin levels. By combining nasal insulin administration with functional MRI, regional insulin sensitivity of the brain can be quantified. The investigators recently found that the insulin action of the brain (stimulated by nasal insulin) regulates both endogenous glucose production and peripheral glucose uptake during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamps. The signals from the brain seem to reach the periphery via the autonomic nervous system in order to modulate metabolic processes. A central brain area in this regard is the hypothalamus. This brain region receives afferents over various systems such as the autonomic nervous system and various endocrine systems (including insulin). The investigators recently characterized the hypothalamus as an insulin-sensitive brain area in humans. The hypothalamus is the key area for homeostatic control throughout the body. Since the dietary intake and the endogenous glucose production are modulated by a hypothalamic insulin effect in humans, we suspect that the observed effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on both processes could be due to altered insulin activity in the brain. Since the SGLT2 inhibition by empagliflozin modulates the autonomic nervous system in the kidneys, signals from the kidney may be transmitted to the brain via the autonomic nervous system, thereby changing specific setpoints, including e.g. insulin sensitivity of the brain. In order to test this hypothesis, a precise phenotyping of prediabetic volunteers with regard to regional brain insulin sensitivity as well as the brain effect on metabolism before and after 8 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin compared to placebo is planned.

The key to managing these patients is prompt and effective analgesia, early mobilization, respiratory support, with chest physiotherapy. The aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the differences between either continuous erector spinae plane (ESP) block, or thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) as analgesic modalities in patients with chest trauma. It is hypothesized that ESP block will be comparable to TEA as a promising effective analgesic alternative with fewer side effects.","Trauma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide as a leading cause of death. Rib fractures are very common and are detected in at least 10% of all injured patients, the majority of which are as a consequence of blunt chest trauma. Chest trauma are associated with severe pain, morbidity and mortality, as it contributes to atelectasis, lobar collapse, pneumonia, effusion, aspiration, acute respiratory distress syndrome pulmonary embolism, increased intensive care admissions, and poor overall clinical outcomes. Trauma is associated with release of cytokines, which contribute to the development of hemodynamic instability and metabolic derangement, which can worsen prognosis. The efficacy of utilizing different modalities for analgesia in controlling extent of tissue damage can be compared by measuring these cytokines levels. Multiple analgesic modalities have been used in these patients with chest trauma, such as oral analgesics, intravenous opioids, patient-controlled opioid analgesia, inter-pleural blocks, intercostal blocks, serratus plane blocks, paravertebral blocks, and TEA. In trauma patients with rib fractures, retrospective studies showed that TEA has become the gold standard of care, while ultrasound-guided paravertebral and serratus plane blocks are possible alternatives. However, no single best analgesic modality could be recommended or established, based on available data in this population, as no meta-analysis on this topic has yet been completed. Ultrasound has been the fundamental tool for a significant improvement in the progress of regional analgesic techniques of inter-fascial chest wall blocks, allowing their description and introduction into clinical practice. Ultrasound-guided ESP block is a new technique that has been recently described in the control of both chronic neuropathic pain as well as acute postsurgical or post-traumatic pain of the chest wall. The ESP block holds promise as a simple, easy, fast and safe technique for thoracic analgesia in the context of pain associated with chest trauma.

Aim of the Study:

The aim of this study is to assess the quality of pain relief and improvement of pulmonary function in patients with chest trauma receiving either continuous ESP block or TEA by comparing and evaluating the differences between the two techniques. It is hypothesized that ESP block will be comparable to TEA as a promising effective analgesic alternative with fewer side effects.

Sample Size Calculation:

The literature available on ESP block is limited to some sporadic case reports and editorials. Hence, this clinical trial will be conducted on 50 patients and post hoc analysis will be performed using pain scores obtained from the present study with an α (type I error) = 0.05 and β (type II error) = 0.2 (power = 80%).

Methods:

The study will be conducted in Mansoura Emergency Hospital on fifty patients admitted with chest trauma. They will be randomly assigned to two equal groups (ESP group and TEA group) according to computer-generated table of random numbers using the permuted block randomization method. The group allocation will be concealed in sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes which will be opened only after obtaining the written informed consent. Patient demographic data including age, sex, body weight, and status of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) will be recorded. A written informed consent will be obtained from all study subjects after ensuring confidentiality. The study protocol will be explained to all patients after enrollment into the study. In both groups, catheter-based analgesia will be performed with a bolus dose of bupivacaine followed by a continuous infusion for 48 hours. Later on, the catheters will be removed, and the pain management will be switched to parental or oral analgesics.

Statistical Methods:

The collected data will be coded, processed, and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program (version 22) for Windows. Normality of numerical data distribution will be tested by Shapiro-Wilk test. Continuous data of normal distribution will be presented as mean ± standard deviation, and compared with the unpaired student's t test. Non-normally distributed data will be presented as median (range), and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test will be used for comparisons within the same group. Categorical data will be presented as number (percentage), and compared with the Chi-square test. All data will be considered statistically significant if P value is ≤ 0.05.","Inclusion Criteria:

Aim of the Study: The aim of this study is to assess the quality of pain relief and improvement of pulmonary function in patients with chest trauma receiving either continuous ESP block or TEA by comparing and evaluating the differences between the two techniques. It is hypothesized that ESP block will be comparable to TEA as a promising effective analgesic alternative with fewer side effects. Sample Size Calculation: The literature available on ESP block is limited to some sporadic case reports and editorials. Hence, this clinical trial will be conducted on 50 patients and post hoc analysis will be performed using pain scores obtained from the present study with an α (type I error) = 0.05 and β (type II error) = 0.2 (power = 80%). Methods: The study will be conducted in Mansoura Emergency Hospital on fifty patients admitted with chest trauma. They will be randomly assigned to two equal groups (ESP group and TEA group) according to computer-generated table of random numbers using the permuted block randomization method. The group allocation will be concealed in sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes which will be opened only after obtaining the written informed consent. Patient demographic data including age, sex, body weight, and status of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) will be recorded. A written informed consent will be obtained from all study subjects after ensuring confidentiality. The study protocol will be explained to all patients after enrollment into the study. In both groups, catheter-based analgesia will be performed with a bolus dose of bupivacaine followed by a continuous infusion for 48 hours. Later on, the catheters will be removed, and the pain management will be switched to parental or oral analgesics. Statistical Methods: The collected data will be coded, processed, and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) program (version 22) for Windows. Normality of numerical data distribution will be tested by Shapiro-Wilk test. Continuous data of normal distribution will be presented as mean ± standard deviation, and compared with the unpaired student's t test. Non-normally distributed data will be presented as median (range), and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test will be used for comparisons within the same group. Categorical data will be presented as number (percentage), and compared with the Chi-square test. All data will be considered statistically significant if P value is ≤ 0.05.

Shahid Gangalal National Heart Centre,OTHER,NCT05880784,PEN Implementation Study,Peer Coaching and Clinical Audit to Facilitate Implementation of the Package of Essential Non-Communicable Diseases (PEN) in Nepal: a Mixed Method Implementation Study,"There is a gap in the implementation of PEN services as well as in the monitoring and evaluation of the WHO PEN in Nepal. One reason for such gaps is due to a lack of team-based care in low-resource settings like Nepal. Both peer coaching and clinical audit have been shown to be cost-effective ways to improve NCD care. However, no data is available regarding its implementation and outcome. Besides, there is a lack of a proven module of peer coaching and clinical audit for effective NCD care implementation. To address this gap, the investigators designed an intervention to reinforce peer coaching and clinical audit practices in health facilities to improve WHO PEN implementation for better NCD management in Nepal.

Aims of Implementation Research

* To assess implementation outcomes (acceptability, adoption, feasibility, penetration, cost and sustainability) of onsite-peer coaching and clinical audit reinforcement intervention on PEN Program implementation at primary healthcare centers.
* To evaluate the effectiveness of onsite-peer coaching and clinic audit reinforcement intervention in PEN program delivery at health facilities.
* To identify barriers and enabling factors impacting the adoption of onsite-peer coaching and clinical audit in the implementation of the PEN program.","Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) kill approximately 41 million people each year. Over 80% of all premature deaths include NCD-related deaths, such as deaths from cardiovascular diseases (17·9 million deaths annually), cancers (9·3 million), respiratory diseases (4.1 million), and diabetes (2.0 million). Eighty percent of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). In Nepal, 51% of all deaths were due to NCDs in 2018. Effective prevention and management to curb mortalities and morbidities from NCDs are possible - and, are widely being implemented. Early detection and management remain central to NCD control.

For early detection and management of NCDs and to prevent life-threatening complications, a cost-effective intervention through an integrated approach, the World Health Organization (WHO) Package of Essential Noncommunicable Diseases Interventions (WHO PEN) was developed. The package provides a holistic guide, including guidelines on screening, diagnosis, treatment and referral processes of NCD patients for early detection and management of chronic diseases within the community with a systematic approach to strengthen the primary health care system.

Furthermore, NCD care is impacted by significant gaps in the capacity of health institutions and systems in terms of training, and availability of adequate resources, including human resources and supplies of necessary medicines. To cope with the shortages of healthcare workers in LMICs, primary care systems can include team-based care strategies according to the WHO PEN strategy.

One of the key aspects of the PEN package to promote NCD management is team-based care. Due to the shortage of physicians and health workers in most countries in the South East and South Asian region, team-based care strategies are added as an integral component of the WHO PEN package. Team-based care is advised in order to provide effective and continuous patient-centered care. WHO PEN package team-based care includes peer coaching and clinical audit.

WHO PEN was introduced in Nepal in 2016 with the main aim to increase access to NCD-related services in the primary health centers and health posts under the Multi-Sectoral Action Plan for NCD Prevention and Control (2014-2020). Nepal Government developed its own PEN Protocol based on WHO PEN Package to promote NCD management. It consists of four protocols for the prevention of heart attack, strokes and kidney disease through integrated management of diabetes and hypertension; health education and counseling on healthy behaviors; prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Asthma; and screening and referral of suspected breast and cervical cancer at Primary Health Center (PHC) level.

Social Effectiveness Therapy for Children (SET-C) is an empirically supported treatment with significant potential to impact the lives of children with this severe and chronic disorder. The proposed Pegasys-VR™ system will distinctly enhance its utility, as it will allow dissemination to a broad variety of clinical settings including schools as well as traditional outpatient clinics. Its use for the treatment of social skills deficits will offer a superior solution for mental health personnel, solving many of the resource and logistic barriers that they currently face. The final product will address cost and practical issues by disseminating an empirically-supported treatment that was rigorously built and tested. Using VE will make the traditional social skills therapy programs program cost-effective and patient-centric, allowing even clinicians with little background/training in behavior therapy to have tools not typically available to them.","Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among youth, with lifetime prevalence ranging between 18-20% of the general population. Among anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 8% of all youth, resulting in significant short and long-term impairment, including increased likelihood of substance abuse, limited academic achievement, attenuated occupational functioning, and impaired or missing social relationships. Emerging data suggest that interventions that include social skills training, formal peer generalization sessions, and homework assignments as part of an overall treatment strategy show enhanced efficacy when compared to interventions without these components - the latter two elements which are designed to enhance skill generalization. Two critical treatment elements (peer generalization, homework assignments) are difficult to implement in traditional clinical settings, limiting optimal dissemination to youth in need of these services in different settings (e.g., at school, outpatient, or community facilities). In a recently completed Phase I STTR, the investigators developed and validated an interactive virtual environment (VE) to solve the need for intensive behavioral practice opportunities that are critical for skill generalization. The VE, known as Pegasys-VR™, allowed intensive practice of social skills without the need for formal peer group activities (in clinic solution) or intensive parental involvement (at-home solution). The results indicated that implementing a VE environment into the SET-C program was accessible, credible and feasible for the parents, clinicians and children who participated in the trial. Furthermore, examination of within group changes indicated statistically significant improvement in SAD symptoms. Given the success of the Phase I, and the need to increase the automation of the system to increase its acceptance and adoption among clinicians and socially anxiety youth, the Phase II STTR study will have the following goals: incorporate an artificial intelligence natural language system, develop additional VEs for in-clinic practice, expand the homework solution to provide additional opportunities to reinforce skills acquisition and generalization practice in in-vivo settings, using serious game theory and technology, and conduct a randomized controlled trial with youth ages 7 to 12 to test whether Pegasys-VR™ is as effective as a traditional behavioral interventions for youth with social anxiety disorder and if the effects are maintained at 3 month follow-up.

The investigators hypothesize that live music:

1. Have an ameliorating effect on physical and psychological symptoms during chemotherapy treatment
2. May counteract the patients feeling of loss of identity and alienation in this particular group of cancer patients.
3. Is more effective in patients with good musical abilities.
4. Is more effective than taped music.

Method: Intervention groups:

1. Listening to patient-preferred live music during chemotherapy
2. Listening to patient-preferred taped music during chemotherapy
3. Standard care

Endpoints:

Primary: Level of anxiety measured by STAI. Secondary: Serum catecholamines.

Background: In order to establish the intervention procedures, the investigators have carried out a pilot study at the hematology department at Hospital of Southwest Denmark, including students from the Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, Southern Denmark. The pilot results indicates that live music has an uplifting, pain relieving, and then releasing effect and that music has a positive impact on hospitalisation.

The project is created in order to both measure psychosocial effects as well as direct stress measures, i.e. serum catecholamine. These physiological changes are measured in order to shed light on the mechanism behind the potential effects of live music on discomfort in connection with chemotherapy treatment.

Perspectives: The vision of the project focus on strengthening the cancer patients' ability to cope with physiological and psychological issues during chemotherapy sessions and to make the patients conscious of music as an option in these coping efforts.

We can then use this as follows: as (i) an aid to surgical planning to enable objective clinical decision making (ii) a decision support tool to communicate the available treatment options to the patient and facilitate shared decision making and provision of personalised care and (iii) to enable standardised objective evaluation of the aesthetic outcome of the treatment procedures. This study aims to demonstrate the ability of the Virtual Physiological Human concept to empower breast cancer patients and assess the impact on their care and quality of life.","Breast cancer is the most common cancer to affect women in Europe, having a lifetime risk of 1 in 9. It is an increasingly treatable disease, and 10-year survival now exceeds 80%. The primary treatment for breast cancer is surgery, which may be used in conjunction with adjuvant therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Given the high breast cancer survival rate, many women will live for many years with the potentially disfiguring aesthetic consequences of their surgical and therapeutic treatment. A good aesthetic outcome is an important endpoint for breast cancer treatment and is closely related to psychosocial recovery and quality of life.

When a woman faces a breast cancer diagnosis, and surgery is proposed, several options are available. The decision as to which type of surgery to offer patients is largely subjective and based almost exclusively on the judgment and experience of the clinician. The cosmetic outcome of surgery is a function of many factors including tumour size and location, the volume of the breast, its density, and the dose and distribution of radiotherapy. In breast-conserving surgery, there is evidence that approximately 30% of women receive a suboptimal or poor aesthetic outcome; however there is currently no standardised method of identifying these women.

The PICTURE project aims to address these issues by providing objective tools, tailored to the individual patient, to predict the aesthetic outcome of local treatment. Using a combination of 3D photography and routinely acquired radiological images (i.e. mammography, ultrasound and MRI, when available), together with information about the tumour (size, location, shape etc.) we will develop techniques to biomechanically model the anatomy of the breast and the effect of surgical removal of cancerous tissue. This digital patient representation and associated predictive tools will enable alternative surgical strategies to be explored and the consequences of the available options, with respect to the appearance of the breast, to be visualised. This will aid communication with the patient of the type of breast surgery recommended by the surgeon, and will empower patients to take an active role in a shared decision making process.

The study will develop tools to enable the patient's aesthetic appearance after treatment to be objectively evaluated. Current techniques use subjective methods, such as assessment by an expert panel, or computer analysis of 2-dimensional photography to estimate, for instance, breast asymmetry. By adopting recent developments in low cost 3D photography and depth sensing technology, we will develop a standardised, reproducible analysis tool which will base the aesthetic outcome evaluation on both the 3-dimensional shape of the reconstructed breast and its volume. This will establish standardised quality assurance and evaluation procedures, enabling institutions across Europe to be compared and factors that have a positive or negative impact on surgical outcome identified.

In summary, the demonstrator created by the PICTURE project will integrate models of surgical techniques and treatment schemes, clinical patient data, multi-modal imaging and individualised models of patient anatomy to build a personalised, digital representation of the patient. The aim is for this to be used as an aid to surgical planning, via simulation of the cosmetic effects of breast conserving surgery, as a decision support tool to communicate the available options to the patient and to enable standardised evaluation and a safe outcome of the procedure.

The decline in muscle mass is estimated to be 0.2-0.5% per year from 60 years old onwards in healthy subjects with the decline worsened by chronic illness, poor appetite and diet, and reduced physical activity in the elderly. Increased morbidity is demonstrable with as little as a 5% loss of muscle mass - therefore, treatments that can prevent or slow the progression of muscle loss with aging are much desired.

Selcuk University,OTHER,NCT03076879,Increasing Participation in Cervical Cancer Screening and Risk for Beliefs/Attitudes Among Women at Risk,The Effect of Nursing Interventions on Women's Cervical Cancer Risk for Beliefs / Attitudes and Attendance to Screening Programme; Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"In order to evaluate the effectiveness of nursing interventions aimed at the early detection of cervical cancer, health belief and participation in the screening of women aged 40-55 at risk for the purpose of cervical cancer, One-way blind pre-test and post-test randomized controlled trial.","Cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer type in the world, among women, in all age groups. Cervical cancer is a high-risk disease, and every two minutes, a woman loses her life due to cervical cancer. In Turkey, among the most common cancers among all age groups among women, 9th is the 5th among the most common cancers in the 25-49 age group. Cervix cancer is a type of cancer that can be prevented and treated at an early stage. Because cervical cancer has a long preclinical period, it has an early diagnosis possibility. For this reason, cervical cancer is one of the cancers recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) screening programs. In countries where regular screenings have been conducted, death rates from cervical cancer have decreased. In developing countries, high incidence and mortality continue due to the inadequacy of screening programs.

The first step in the early diagnosis of cervical cancer is usually the result of an abnormal Pap smear test. The Pap smear test is an ideal cytologic screening test used for screening because it can identify early onset of a cellular change that may be a starting point for cervical cancer and is cost effective. The number of women who have had the Pap smear test, which is so important in early diagnosis, is not at a level all over the world and in our country. In developed countries, cervical cancer screening rates are over 60%, while in underdeveloped and developing countries this rate is below 20%. In our country, the rate of not having any pap smear test over the age of 15 years is 77.9%.

Studies have shown that when women with cervical cancer are diagnosed early, their life span is prolonged and their chances of survival increase. Early diagnosis of cervical cancer is a simple, feasible and economical method. Women's lack of knowledge, worries about negative test results, and their reasons for not having a Pap smear test are among the reasons. Along with being semi-empirical studies in our country, most are based solely on education and do not involve a risk group approach. In addition, there was no randomized controlled trial (RCT) with evidence in the definition of causal relationship in our country. For this reason, determining the factors affecting the early diagnosis behavior of women, planning and implementing nursing interventions for these factors will contribute to the improvement of early diagnosis behavior of women with cervical cancer. In this respect, health education for cervical cancer and early diagnosis to be made to women in the risk group will have made a unique contribution to RCT including motivational initiatives and home visits.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of nursing interventions aimed at early detection of cervical cancer, health beliefs and participation in scans in women aged 40-55 years at risk for prognostic cervical cancer, One-way blind pre-test - final test was planned as RCT. In this context, women in the risk group of 40-55 years of age with cervical cancer in the project will constitute the universe of RCT. No pap smear test, no previous training for cervical cancer, no previous hysterectomy, no previous cancer diagnosis, no current or past sexual life and at least one of the identified risk factors Will have women involved. Women who are in the risk group for cervical cancer and meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study will be randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, cervical cancer will constitute nursing initiatives for health education, home visits, problem-specific counseling and phone reminders for women at risk. Women in the experimental group will receive a 15-week follow-up. Two reminders will be used to increase motivation between home visits and trainings. The effectiveness of counseling and training programs will be assessed by means of data collection tools that will be used for pretest / posttest for women in the experimental and control groups and the data form prepared by the researcher in the light of the literature.

Depending on the project, women are expected to participate in the cervical cancer screening program. Home visits, trainings, counseling and reminders by phone will raise awareness levels of women at risk for cervical cancer as a result. As a result, increased participation of women in the risk group in screening programs will increase the probability of early diagnosis and reduce cervical cancer mortality, reduce the cost and improve the health of the community.","Inclusion Criteria:

Cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer type in the world, among women, in all age groups. Cervical cancer is a high-risk disease, and every two minutes, a woman loses her life due to cervical cancer. In Turkey, among the most common cancers among all age groups among women, 9th is the 5th among the most common cancers in the 25-49 age group. Cervix cancer is a type of cancer that can be prevented and treated at an early stage. Because cervical cancer has a long preclinical period, it has an early diagnosis possibility. For this reason, cervical cancer is one of the cancers recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) screening programs. In countries where regular screenings have been conducted, death rates from cervical cancer have decreased. In developing countries, high incidence and mortality continue due to the inadequacy of screening programs. The first step in the early diagnosis of cervical cancer is usually the result of an abnormal Pap smear test. The Pap smear test is an ideal cytologic screening test used for screening because it can identify early onset of a cellular change that may be a starting point for cervical cancer and is cost effective. The number of women who have had the Pap smear test, which is so important in early diagnosis, is not at a level all over the world and in our country. In developed countries, cervical cancer screening rates are over 60%, while in underdeveloped and developing countries this rate is below 20%. In our country, the rate of not having any pap smear test over the age of 15 years is 77.9%. Studies have shown that when women with cervical cancer are diagnosed early, their life span is prolonged and their chances of survival increase. Early diagnosis of cervical cancer is a simple, feasible and economical method. Women's lack of knowledge, worries about negative test results, and their reasons for not having a Pap smear test are among the reasons. Along with being semi-empirical studies in our country, most are based solely on education and do not involve a risk group approach. In addition, there was no randomized controlled trial (RCT) with evidence in the definition of causal relationship in our country. For this reason, determining the factors affecting the early diagnosis behavior of women, planning and implementing nursing interventions for these factors will contribute to the improvement of early diagnosis behavior of women with cervical cancer. In this respect, health education for cervical cancer and early diagnosis to be made to women in the risk group will have made a unique contribution to RCT including motivational initiatives and home visits. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of nursing interventions aimed at early detection of cervical cancer, health beliefs and participation in scans in women aged 40-55 years at risk for prognostic cervical cancer, One-way blind pre-test - final test was planned as RCT. In this context, women in the risk group of 40-55 years of age with cervical cancer in the project will constitute the universe of RCT. No pap smear test, no previous training for cervical cancer, no previous hysterectomy, no previous cancer diagnosis, no current or past sexual life and at least one of the identified risk factors Will have women involved. Women who are in the risk group for cervical cancer and meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study will be randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, cervical cancer will constitute nursing initiatives for health education, home visits, problem-specific counseling and phone reminders for women at risk. Women in the experimental group will receive a 15-week follow-up. Two reminders will be used to increase motivation between home visits and trainings. The effectiveness of counseling and training programs will be assessed by means of data collection tools that will be used for pretest / posttest for women in the experimental and control groups and the data form prepared by the researcher in the light of the literature. Depending on the project, women are expected to participate in the cervical cancer screening program. Home visits, trainings, counseling and reminders by phone will raise awareness levels of women at risk for cervical cancer as a result. As a result, increased participation of women in the risk group in screening programs will increase the probability of early diagnosis and reduce cervical cancer mortality, reduce the cost and improve the health of the community.

Comparisons to results from a similar project in methadone-exposed pregnancies will be made. This proposal seeks to advance the way the investigators inform the treatment of the opioid dependent woman during pregnancy and her infant after birth.","There is an increase in the prevalence of illicit opiate use among women of childbearing age in many countries today. Methadone is the treatment of choice for opioid dependency during pregnancy in the US because it markedly diminishes withdrawal symptoms and craving and blocks opioid effects, however, in utero exposure results in significant depression of fetal neurobehaviors such as fetal heart rate and heart rate variability and fetal motor activity, and significant neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the majority of exposed infants. Since its approval in 2002, the prescription of buprenorphine for opioid dependence has increased dramatically but, as with methadone, this mediation is not approved for use during pregnancy. Currently, women treated with buprenorphine prior to pregnancy are transitioned to methadone treatment due to a lack of information regarding the effects of buprenorphine on the developing fetus and infant. Pilot work by this research team suggests that buprenorphine- as compared to methadone-exposed fetuses display more optimal neurobehavioral functioning in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Although these results are encouraging, there is a critical need to explore fully the effects of this medication on the fetus and infant to adequately advise care providers and patients regarding its use. This is particularly true given the imminent publication of a pivotal study comparing buprenorphine to methadone treatment during pregnancy which has suggested the optimality of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence during pregnancy, and is likely to result in increasing numbers of women being treated with off-label buprenorphine during pregnancy. This proposal seeks to explore the effect of buprenorphine on maternal physiology and fetal neurobehavioral functioning longitudinally as a measure of the development of the fetal nervous system. Additionally, the neurobehavioral profile and NAS of the buprenorphine-exposed infant up to one month will be delineated in an effort to provide information necessary to provide optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment of NAS. Furthermore, this group has previously explored similar parameters in methadone-exposed fetuses and infants, and results of this study can be compared to those historical data. These parameters will advance our understanding of the way the investigators view and implement the future pharmacologic treatment of the opiate dependent woman during pregnancy and her infant after birth, and inform clinicians, health insurance companies and regulatory agencies in the provision of optimal care to the opioid dependent pregnant woman and her offspring before and after birth.","Inclusion Criteria:

National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),NIH,NCT00076479,Role of the Right Brain in Recovery of Language Function in Chronic Stroke,,"This study will examine in healthy individuals and in patients with aphasia (a language disturbance that is usually caused by stroke, brain disease, or injury) which parts of the brain are involved in naming everyday objects. In most people, language and speech originate in the left side of the brain. When this side of the brain is damaged, language function is often impaired. Often, however, function partly recovers, possibly because the right half of the brain takes over some language functions when the left half is injured.

Healthy volunteers and patients with aphasia due to stroke may be eligible for this study. All candidates must be 18 years of age and older. Patients' aphasia must have occurred as the result of a stroke that occurred more than 12 months before entering the study. In addition, their stroke must not have affected the brainstem or cerebellum. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, brief physical examination, and questionnaire about handedness. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

Session 1: Magnetic resonance scanning (MRI)

MRI is a diagnostic and research tool that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues, including the brain. The subject lies in a cylindrical machine for up to 60 minutes. Loud thumping noises occur when the radiofrequency circuits are switched; this noise can be muffled by the use of earplugs.

Sessions 2 and 3: Picture naming during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)

For transcranial magnetic stimulation, a wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and feels a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may also be a twitch in the muscles of the arm or leg. During the TMS, subjects are asked to name pictures of common everyday objects that appear on a computer screen. They are asked to name them as fast and as accurately as possible. Their voice is recorded to determine the accuracy of their answers and the time it takes to answer. Subjects may also be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions during the TMS to position the coil properly.","Background: Aphasia, a language impairment usually induced by stroke, is typically the result of damage to the left hemisphere. Severity of this disorder can vary across patients, as well as the degree of impairment at various levels of linguistic processes. However, one consistent symptom of aphasia is anomia (or dysnomia) which is a word finding deficit. Given the reliable presence of anomia, picture naming is a common task used both clinically and experimentally to probe linguistic processing.

Functional imaging studies have suggested that the right hemisphere may be recruited to compensate for loss of left hemispheric language regions. However, they could not assess the functional significance of the observed activations. In a previous experiment (NIDCD protocol 92-DC-0178), we have identified the areas activated in association with language function (picture naming) in patients with chronic stroke that have partially recovered from an initially severe aphasia and in healthy, age- and gender-matched controls. The preliminary outcome is increased involvement of the right hemisphere for picture naming in recovered aphasics.

Objectives: In the present protocol, we plan to test the hypothesis that right hemispheric homologues of traditional left hemispheric anterior and posterior language areas are the neural substrate mediating recovery of language functions in patients with chronic stroke. This investigation is important because it can provide novel evidence on plasticity of language functions in chronic stroke.

Study Population: We plan to include chronic stroke patients that suffer from aphasia, and healthy, age- and gender-matched controls.

Design: We will test if inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of right-hemispheric cortical areas (inferior frontal gyrus - IFG, superior temporal gyrus - STG, middle temporal gyrus - MTG) that are activated during picture naming will result in a decrease in task performance (picture naming latency) in chronic stroke patients, in comparison to stimulation of left hemispheric areas in aphasics, and right-hemispheric homologue areas in healthy controls. The TMS experiment is necessary to identify a cause-effect link between right hemispheric activation and recovery of language functions after chronic stroke. Stereotactic applications of TMS during the picture naming task will be implemented over six cortical sites in both groups: left IFG, left STG, left MTG, and right IFG, right STG, and right MTG.

Outcome Measures: The outcome measure will be performance on the picture naming task (primary outcome measure reaction time) during TMS as a function of subject group and stimulation site.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

We will include patients with thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions and with hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions (as documented by CT or MRI) at least 12 months after the stroke.

We will choose subjects with chronic stable aphasia, that initially presented with severe aphasia and have partially recovered.

Assessment of the initial functional state will be taken either from patient report or medical records. All of the aphasic patients are already known to the investigators from the NIDCD.

INCLUSION CRITERIA: We will include patients with thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions and with hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions (as documented by CT or MRI) at least 12 months after the stroke. We will choose subjects with chronic stable aphasia, that initially presented with severe aphasia and have partially recovered. Assessment of the initial functional state will be taken either from patient report or medical records. All of the aphasic patients are already known to the investigators from the NIDCD. EXCLUSION CRITERIA - HEALTHY CONTROLS: Unable to perform the task (naming of everyday objects in less than 10 s). History of alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness like depression. Epilepsy. Are less than 18 years of age. Pregnant or breast feeding a child. EXCLUSION CRITERIA - PATIENTS: Unable to perform the task (naming of everyday objects in less than 10 s). History of alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness like depression. Epilepsy. Are less than 18 years of age. Pregnant or breast feeding a child. Patients with cerebellar or brainstem lesions. Patients or subjects with severe uncontrolled medical problems (e.g. cardiovascular disease, severe rheumatoid arthritis, active joint deformity of arthritic origin, active cancer or renal disease, any kind of end-stage pulmonary or cardiovascular disease). Patients or subjects with increased intracranial pressure as evaluated by clinical means. Individuals receiving drugs acting primarily on the central nervous system."
