Poitiers University Hospital,OTHER,NCT03444779,"Comparative Evaluation of Minimally Invasive ""tibial Tuberoplasty"" Surgical Technique Versus Conventional Open Surgery for Tibial Plateau Fractures","Comparative Evaluation of Minimally Invasive ""tibial Tuberoplasty"" Surgical Technique Versus Conventional Open Surgery for Tibial Plateau Fractures (TUBERIMPACT Study)","PMSI (French Medico-Administrative Database) data shows more than 10000 proximal tibial fractures diagnosed in 2014 and 4055 lateral tibial plateau fractures operated in 2013 in France. 50% of these surgical fractures is related to the lateral condyle and causes split/depression (Schatzker 2) or pure depression (Schatzker 3). This high rate results from the recent democratization of high-risk sports, as well as an aging population with increased risks of falling. Aside from the resulting reduced physical activity, the social and professional impact of these fractures is undeniable and represents significant costs for our health care system. A recently published prospective case series reports 28 job losses out of 41 patients treated.

The clinical outcome of these patients depends mainly on the primary stability provided by the surgical treatment, after the greatest anatomical reduction possible. Indeed, Giannoudis and al. have demonstrated that under simple X-rays, the smaller the detected step-off, the better the outcome.The aim is to allow for recovery of good joint mobility to promote rapid resumption of activity and to limit the onset of early osteoarthritis.

The classical technique used for reduction and osteosynthesis of tibial plateau fractures (open surgical technique using a bone tamp) has several pitfalls : devascularization of the bone and skin, risks of infection and functional rehabilitation difficulties with delayed recovery of weight bearing. Moreover, this technique does not allow for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of other possible lesions, such as meniscal injuries in particular.

Since 2011, Poitiers University Hospital is offering to its patients a new minimally invasive technique for the reduction and stabilization of tibial plateau fractures, baptized ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"". The concept derives from the divergent use of vertebral kyphoplasty, initially dedicated for spinal injuries and transposed here to the tibial plateau. This technique involves expansion of the tibial plateau through inflation of a kyphoplasty balloon, filling of the created cavity with cement (PMMA, calcium phosphate) and percutaneous screw fixation.

Orthopaedic surgeons of Poitiers University Hospital performed the first tibial tuberoplasties through a feasibility study on 36 cadaveric subjects and then transposed the technique to human. Surgeons identified major advantages such as minimal skin damage, possible treatment of posterior and multi-fragmented compressions (lifting in a single block by the balloon), reinforcement of the stability of the assembly using cement, possible use of combined arthroscopy (for concomitant meniscal injuries treatment).

This technique allows for optimization of the fracture reduction by elevating the posterior fragments with the inflatable bone tamp through an anterior approach. The reduction is made possible thanks to the specificity of the inflatable bone tamp which inflates and reduces the area of least resistance.

The aim of this innovative technique is focused on the anatomical reduction in order to restore the convexity of the tibial plateau which is similar to the balloon convexity.

The results from the first 40 patients operated since 2011 are promising and show a proportion of 70% presenting less than 5 mm step-off reduction. A larger scale multicenter randomized controlled trial is now requested to further demonstrate the superiority of the ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"" to the standard treatment.

The coordinator investigator designed this study to evaluate the quality of tibial fracture reduction offered by percutaneous ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"" versus conventional open surgery for tibial plateau fracture but also its impact on clinical outcome.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

"University of California, San Francisco",OTHER,NCT02815579,Agricultural Intervention for Food Security and HIV Health Outcomes in Kenya,Agricultural Intervention for Food Security and HIV Health Outcomes in Kenya,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether this multisectoral agricultural and microcredit loan intervention improves food security, prevent antiretroviral treatment failure, and reduce co-morbidities among people living with HIV/AIDS.","Despite major advances in care and treatment for those living with HIV, morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) remains unacceptably high in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), largely due to the parallel challenges of poverty and food insecurity.\[1\] In the Nyanza Region of Kenya, 15.1% of the adult population is infected by HIV,\[2\] and over 50% of the rural population is food insecure, primarily due to unpredictable rainfall and limited irrigation.\[3,4\] The investigators have previously shown that food insecurity delays antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, reduces ART adherence, contributes to worse immunologic and virologic outcomes, and increases morbidity and mortality among PLHIV.\[5-16\] There has been increasing international recognition that improved food security and reduced poverty are essential components for a successful global response to the HIV epidemic.\[17-21\] Yet, to date few studies have systematically evaluated the impacts of sustainable food security interventions on health, economic, and behavioral outcomes among PLHIV. Agricultural interventions, which have potential to raise income and bolster food security, are an important but understudied route through which to sustainably improve nutritional and HIV outcomes in SSA, including Kenya where agriculture accounts for \> 75% of the total workforce, and 51% of the gross domestic product.\[22\]

Building on the investigators successful completion of the pilot intervention trial in Kenya and the investigators collective experience studying structural barriers to HIV care in SSA, the investigators plan to test the hypothesis that a multisectoral agricultural and microcredit loan intervention will improve food security, prevent ART treatment failure, and reduce co-morbidities among PLHIV. The investigators' intervention was co-developed with KickStart, a prominent non-governmental organization (NGO) based in SSA that has introduced a human-powered pump, enabling farmers to grow high yield crops year-round. This technology has reduced food insecurity and poverty for 800,000 users in 22 countries in the subcontinent since 1991.\[23\] The investigators' intervention includes: a) a loan (\~$175) from a well-established Kenyan bank for purchasing agricultural implements and commodities; b) agricultural implements to be purchased with the loan including the KickStart treadle pump, seeds, fertilizers and pesticides; and c) education in financial management and sustainable farming practices occurring in the setting of patient support groups. This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of this intervention with the following specific aims:

Aim 1: To determine the impact of a multisectoral agricultural intervention among HIV-infected farmers on ART on HIV clinical outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to improved viral load suppression (primary outcome) and changes in CD4 cell count, physical health status, WHO stage III/IV disease, and hospitalizations (secondary outcomes) in the intervention arm compared to the control arm.

Aim 2: To understand the pathways through which the multisectoral intervention may improve HIV health outcomes. Using the investigator's theoretical model,\[1,24\] the investigators hypothesize that the intervention will improve food security and household wealth, which in turn will contribute to improved outcomes through nutritional (improved nutritional status measured with Body Mass Index), behavioral (improved ART adherence, and retention in care), and mental health (improved mental health/less depression, improved empowerment) pathways (secondary outcomes).

Aim 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and obtain the information necessary to inform scale-up in Kenya and similar settings in SSA. The investigators will quantify the cost per disability-adjusted life year averted, and identify lessons to inform successful scale-up.

To accomplish Aims 1 \& 2, the investigators will randomize 8 matched pairs of health facilities in the Nyanza Region in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms, and enroll 44 participants per facility (total n=704). All participants will be followed for 2 years. Impacts of the investigator's intervention on primary health outcomes and mediators will be investigated to provide definitive data of direct and indirect intervention effects. To accomplish Aim 3, the investigators will: a) conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis; b) identify the characteristics of individuals most likely to benefit from the intervention (e.g., gender, educational attainment, family size, wealth, risk tolerance, and entrepreneurial ability); and c) perform a mixed-methods process evaluation with study participants, staff, and various stakeholders to determine what worked and did not work to guide future scale-up efforts of the intervention.

The number of patients surviving acute myocardial injury is increasing due to improved acute treatment. However, after the initial repair, the tissue undergoes a remodeling phase to compensate for the damaged area. This re-modeling phase can change the structure end geometry of the heart resulting in lower ejection fraction, leading to cardiac dysfunction, which eventually leads to heart failure. Understanding and ideally modifying the reparative mechanisms following myocardial infarction is increasingly important and may lead to improved outcome.

If the heart suffers from ischemia following an acute coronary event, the tissue reacts strongly to the hypoxia. The body will as a compensatory mechanism create new vessel to provide the tissue with oxygen. This is known as the biological process of angiogenesis. This complex process involves different angiogenic and pro-fibrotic transcription factors that initiate the restoration of capillaries by sprouting from the existing endothelial cells in response to hypoxia.

Time seem essential to protect and save the myocardium. An early onset of cytokines and growth factors is associated with a decline in cardiomyocytes apoptosis, smaller infarct areas, and decreased ventricular dilation. Therefore, an early induction of angiogenesis seems important for a good prognosis of the patient.

Integrin αvβ3 is a transmembrane cell surface receptor that is markedly upregulated in states of angiogenesis. It facilitates migration and proliferation and thereby allowing cells to respond to extracellular environment. Integrin αvβ3 is thus a key player in the angiogenic process. The integrin αvβ3 has a binding site for an RGD peptide (Arg-Gly-Asp motif) and this can be targeted by PET tracers.

RGD-based PET tracers have been shown to accumulate at the site of myocardial necrosis in both human and animal studies. The uptake seems to peak a few weeks after the infarction and may correlate to recovery of cardiac function and thus serve as a prognostic marker.","Inclusion Criteria:

Ischemic heart disease is worldwide the single most frequent cause of death. The number of patients surviving acute myocardial injury is increasing due to improved acute treatment. However, after the initial repair, the tissue undergoes a remodeling phase to compensate for the damaged area. This re-modeling phase can change the structure end geometry of the heart resulting in lower ejection fraction, leading to cardiac dysfunction, which eventually leads to heart failure. Understanding and ideally modifying the reparative mechanisms following myocardial infarction is increasingly important and may lead to improved outcome. If the heart suffers from ischemia following an acute coronary event, the tissue reacts strongly to the hypoxia. The body will as a compensatory mechanism create new vessel to provide the tissue with oxygen. This is known as the biological process of angiogenesis. This complex process involves different angiogenic and pro-fibrotic transcription factors that initiate the restoration of capillaries by sprouting from the existing endothelial cells in response to hypoxia. Time seem essential to protect and save the myocardium.

It is a part of a group of drugs called ""epothilones"" which appear to cause shrinkage of cancer in some patients with breast cancer. It is generally difficult for chemotherapy to enter the brain. However, it is believed that ZK219477 crosses into the brain. We are also studying whether an investigational MRI scan procedure may eventually help to predict which patients will benefit from ZK219477.","* Participants will be given ZK219477 intravenously over approximately 30 minutes every three weeks.
* During all treatment cycles a physical exam and questions about the participants general health and specific questions about any problems they may be having will be performed.

* compare the effects of dose-matched unilateral vs bilateral vs unilateral combined with bilateral upper limb rehabilitation based on task-related practice
* compare the effects of unilateral vs bilateral training based on robot-assisted devices
* study the predictors of treatment outcomes and clinimetric properties of the biomechanical measures","An estimated 30% to 66 % of stroke victims have poor upper extremity function at 6 months after stroke, which contributes to long-term disability in these patients. Training the affected UE of stroke patients has thus been a mainstay of neurorehabilitation. The goal of the intervention is to restore motor and daily functions. New therapeutic strategies have been developed based on principles of neurorehabilitation and motor learning. The need for comparative effectiveness research of the innovative treatments has been called for to promote evidence-based practice and translational science in stroke motor rehabilitation. Wolf and Whitall called for rigorous comparisons between unilateral and bilateral training. McCombe Waller and Whitall also indicated the importance of combining unilateral with bilateral training. For low-functioning patients, robot-assisted training is a possible approach. Identifying possible determinants for unilateral and bilateral training outcomes may also elucidate the factors that influence treatment outcomes. Outcome measures are required that have good clinimetric properties for measuring the effects of the rehabilitation strategies.

The long-term objective is to conduct comparative efficacy research to identify the possible mechanisms and the relative effectiveness of existing rehabilitation approaches of fully defined-, evidence-based, and theory-grounded approaches. This proposed project aims to (1) compare the effects of dose-matched unilateral vs bilateral vs unilateral combined with bilateral upper limb rehabilitation based on task-related practice; (2) compare the effects of unilateral vs bilateral training based on robot-assisted devices; and (3) study the predictors of treatment outcomes and clinimetric properties of the biomechanical measures. The outcome measures will span the spectrum of health-related functioning, including motor and neural control, movement performance, daily functions, and quality of life. Motor and neural control mechanisms involving movement strategies, muscle and force output, and brain reorganization will be evaluated using kinematic, electromyographic (EMG), and kinetic analyses, and also functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examinations. Clinical outcomes will include movement performance, daily functions, and quality of life, measured by MYOTON-3, Modified Ashworth Scale, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, Functional Independence Measure, ABILHAND questionnaire, accelerometers, and Stroke Impact Scale. This 5-year project will recruit an estimated 200 patients with stroke. For Part 1, 120 patients with mild-to-moderate motor impairment will be randomized to the dose-matched unilateral, bilateral, or combined group. For Part 1, 80 stroke patients with moderate motor impairment will be randomized to the dose-matched unilateral or bilateral robot-assisted therapy group. Treatment regimens will be designed to ensure that patients in the 3 groups in Part 1 and 2 groups in Part 2 receive an equivalent intensity of treatment (5 days/week for 1.5 hours/day for 4 consecutive weeks). The intervention will be provided at 4 hospitals. Two certified occupational therapists will be trained in the administration of the 5 types of rehabilitation protocols by the PI and a co-PI and will complete a written competency test before subject treatment.

Biomechanical (kinematic, EMG, and kinetic) and fMRI examinations will be performed before, immediately after the 4-week intervention period, and at the 3-month follow-up period (no fMRI examination at follow-up). Clinical measures will be administered before, at midterm (2 weeks after intervention), immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. At least 3 examiners (1 research assistant, 1 graduate student, and 1 post-doc fellow) blind to group allocation will be in charge of biomechanical, fMRI, and clinical measures. Each type of measure will require 2 evaluators to collaborate for completing the assessment. Before being allowed to work with participants, the examiner's competence will be assessed by the PI and co-PI, and interrater reliability for clinical tests established.

Multivariate analysis of covariance will be used to examine changes in all outcome measures as a function of treatment while controlling for baseline data. Multiple regression models will be established to determine the potential predictors for different functional outcomes of each intervention (unilateral and bilateral training approach). The responsiveness and validity of the biomechanical measures relevant for clinimetric scrutiny will be examined by the index of standardized response mean and Spearman correlation coefficients. The clinical important differences of the biomechanical parameters will be determined by the anchor-based and the distribution-based clinical important differences estimate.","Inclusion Criteria:

Norwegian University of Science and Technology,OTHER,NCT02004184,Pemetrexed in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: at Progression vs Maintenance Therapy After Induction Chemotherapy,Maintenance Pemetrexed Therapy After Induction Chemotherapy Versus Pemetrexed at Progression in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Study,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for a majority (approximately 85%) of lung cancer cases. Patients with localized disease can be cured through surgery, but only 20 % are operable.For the majority of patients with advanced disease, palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the recommended therapy. Chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves quality of life.

The recommended first-line therapy is 4-6 courses of a platinum in combination with a third generation compound (e.g. gemcitabine, vinorelbine, docetaxel, pemetrexed, paclitaxel). After first-line therapy, it has been recommended to observe the patients and offer second-line chemotherapy at disease progression.

Regimens for second-line therapy include docetaxel or pemetrexed monotherapy. Pemetrexed is less toxic and superior to gemcitabine in non-squamous NSCLC, whereas docetaxel is the recommended second-line therapy in squamous cell carcinoma.

The results of the studies of maintenance pemetrexed therapy are encouraging; the observed survival benefit is clinically relevant and relatively large considering the poor survival in patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, pemetrexed appears to be well tolerated. There are, however, several limitations to the studies that have been conducted: Relatively few elderly patients and no PS 2 patients were enrolled - and not all patients on the control-arms received pemetrexed at progression.

The overall aim of this study is to investigate whether immediate maintenance pemetrexed therapy prolongs survival compared to observation and pemetrexed therapy at progression in patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, it will be explored whether patients with 'performance status' 2 and elderly ≥ 70 years tolerate and benefit from maintenance therapy; and what characteristics and blood biomarkers are associated with sensitivity and tolerability of such therapy.","In previous studies without maintenance therapy, median overall survival (OS) for performance status (PS) 0-1 patients has been approximately 9 months, corresponding to 6 months from randomization in this study. We consider an improvement in overall survival of two months to be the minimum difference that will lead to routine use of maintenance pemetrexed in Norway. To demonstrate an improvement in median overall survival from 6 to 8 months with an α =0.05 and β =0.20, 198 evaluable patients are required on each arm. We expect a drop-out rate of maximum 10 %, and therefore intend to randomize a total of 436 patients (PS 0-1) - of which we expect 150 to be 70 years or older.

Sample size is calculated on PS 0-1 patients only. In addition, PS 2 patients will be randomized until the required number of PS 0-1 patients have been accrued. We estimate that a total of 100 PS 2 patients will be enrolled - sufficient for hypothesis-generating analyses of the benefit of maintenance therapy in elderly and PS 2 patients.

Based on experience from our previous studies we estimate that approximately 30% of patients will not complete or progress during induction chemotherapy; or be ineligible due deterioration of PS. Consequently, we need to include approximately 765 patients.","Inclusion Criteria:

University College Cork,OTHER,NCT03145584,Continuous Versus Single-Shot Adductor Canal Block in Total Knee Arthroplasty,A Comparison of the Effects of Continuous and Single-Shot Adductor Canal Blocks on Analgesia and Knee Flexion Following Total Knee Arthroplasty,"Pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is associated with delayed recovery, impaired mobility, increased morbidity, longer hospital stay and greater cost. Adductor canal block has recently been shown to improve the pain control of patients following TKA. It is not known whether a single shot technique or a continuous catheter-based infusion technique provides optimal analgesia. The investigators hypothesize that a continuous technique would provide better analgesia and permit patients to achieve objective measures of recovery following TKA than a single shot technique.","Introduction

Total knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is the standard treatment for knee osteoarthritis, which affects millions of people world wide. In 2008, more than 600,000 TKAs were performed in the United States. This number represents more than double the number performed in 1999 and is estimated to increase by more than 500 % (from the 1999 value) by 2020.

Severe postoperative pain occurs in 60% and moderate pain in 30% of patients undergoing TKA. In addition, the intensity of acute postoperative pain correlates with the risk of developing a persistent post surgical pain which can be chronic and debilitating. Thus, the management of pain following TKA is an important determinant of a patient's long term functional outcome. In addition, recovery from TKA requires extensive and effective postoperative physiotherapy (PT), itself a painful event following TKA. Physiotherapy ensures good range of motion and prevents complications such as tissue retraction, adhesion formation and muscle atrophy, all of which may compromise achievement of long term recovery milestones. Thus, the anesthesiologist caring for patients undergoing TKA attempts to provide a postoperative analgesic regimen which ensures that the patient is as pain free as possible while ensuring that the patient has sufficient motor strength to participate actively in PT.

The need to find non-narcotic alternatives for post surgical pain management has become even more urgent recently due to the recent epidemic of narcotic-related deaths. In the United States the number of opioid related deaths since 1999 has reached almost half a million which represents a four fold increase in incidence, and at least half of opioid related deaths involve prescription drugs. Hence effective non-narcotic approaches to pain management hold great importance not only for clinical care but also for public health on a larger scale.

Previously, intravenous, intrathecal or oral opioids were the mainstay of postoperative analgesia following TKA. Although variably effective, the resulting analgesia is associated with well recognized adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, pruritus and sedation. Each adverse effect is unpleasant and likely to impede recovery and participation in PT. Epidural catheters and femoral nerve blocks have both been used for postoperative analgesia in this setting, but each is associated with lower limb motor weakness which hinders early implementation of PT and may increase the risk of falls.

Recently, adductor canal block (ACB) has been reported as an effective means of providing post-operative analgesia for TKA. The ACB is not a new block, having been first described by van der Wal over 20 years ago. The adductor canal block, in the context of analgesia following TKA, is relatively recent, being first described by Tsai et al in 2010. Infiltration of local anesthetic into the adductor canal blocks primarily the saphenous nerve, a sensory nerve, which supplies the medial and anteromedial aspects of the knee via an infra patellar branch.

Postoperative pain following TKA extends well beyond the 8-12 hour duration of a single bolus injection of local anesthetic. Continuous peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) can facilitate early discharge and better rehabilitation in the early postoperative period. In addition, PNB decreases opioid consumption, its associated side effects and is also associated with greater patient satisfaction .

The investigators hypothesized that patients receiving continuous adductor canal block would achieve a greater degree of active knee flexion on POD 2 following TKA than those who receive a single injection ACB.

METHODS Subjects With Institutional ethical approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals, 40 consecutive patients scheduled for unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty who met the study criteria and provided written informed consent, were enrolled in a double blind, randomized clinical trial.

Patients were randomly allocated to receive either an ACB followed by catheter placement (n=20) or an adductor canal block followed by sham catheter placement (n=20). The sham catheter was placed on the surface of the leg and covered by an opaque dressing to conceal the insertion site. (A similar dressing was placed on real catheter insertions to conceal group assignment from both patient and assessor.) All patients had the proximal end of their catheter attached to a Pajunk 350 ml FuserPump (FuserPumps are portable elastomeric infusion pumps) concealed in opaque bags to prevent patients and assessors from determining which pumps were actually functioning. These pumps function without a motor and so make no sound. Computer generated randomization was performed for patient group assignment at the time of enrolment in the study. Randomization assignments were done in blocks of 10 in a 1:1 ratio with assignments placed in sealed numbered opaque envelopes. Only the anesthesiologist responsible for performing the block was aware of the group to which a given patient was assigned. The researchers responsible for data collection were unaware of the group to which each patient was assigned .

Preoperative Preparation Potential patients were provided information on the study during the preoperative physiotherapy assessment several weeks before their scheduled surgery. At this time, baseline values for knee flexion and the TUG test were obtained. On the day of surgery, after obtaining written informed consent, patients were assigned to a study group by attaching a sealed randomization envelope to their charts.

After registration on the day of surgery patients were brought to the pre-anesthetic area where IV cannulation was performed and standard anesthetic monitors applied. Patients received intravenous sedation prior to placement of the spinal anesthetic at the discretion of the responsible consultant anesthesiologist. A spinal anesthetic was performed under standard aseptic conditions in the usual fashion. The choice of local anesthetic (either isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% or hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%.) used to perform the spinal anesthetic was at the discretion of the responsible consultant anesthesiologist.

Intraoperative Period Patients received intraoperative sedation at the discretion of the consultant anesthesiologist using fentanyl, midazolam and propofol as deemed clinically appropriate. At the conclusion of the procedure, the patients received 30 ml 0.5% bupivacaine diluted with 70 ml 0.9% saline local infiltration analgesia (LIA) injected into the layers of soft tissue around the knee joint by the surgeon. .

Postoperative Period All blocks were performed in the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit immediately after surgery with standard anesthetic monitoring and an IV cannula in place. No subcutaneous local anesthetic or sedation were required as the spinal anesthetic was still effective. All patients received an adductor canal block under ultrasound guidance using a high frequency probe at the mid thigh level. After appropriate asepsis local anesthesia to the skin was placed at the level of the mid femur on the medial aspect of the thigh. Using ultrasound guidance (General Electric Venue 40, 3050 Lake Drive, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Ireland) with a high frequency L12 linear transducer the femoral artery was visualized in cross section and the ultrasound needle (B Braun Contiplex D ultrasound needle and catheter set, B Braun Melsungen AG, 34209 Melsungen, Germany) placed using in-plane visualization below the Sartorius muscle and just lateral to the femoral artery and medial to the Vastus Medialis. All patients received an injection of bupivacaine 0.5% 10 ml. For patients allocated to receive a continuous infusion postoperatively, a catheter was inserted immediately after injection of the initial bolus of local anesthetic. Patients allocated to the single injection group received the injection of local anesthetic followed by placement of a sham catheter on the skin, covered with a large opaque dressing. (Figure 3) In both groups, patients' catheters were attached to the concealed in opaque bags. The sham pumps were filled with normal saline. The pumps containing local anesthetic contained 0.15625% bupivacaine 350 ml were set to run at 8 ml/ hour (the equivalent of 0.125 % bupivacaine running at 10 ml/hour) All blocks were placed by Consultant anesthesiologists with fellowship training in Regional Anaesthesia.

All patients received multimodal oral analgesia which included Paracetamol 1g po every 6 hours, oxycodone (oxycontin) po twice a day (10 mg/dose for patients \>70 years and 20 mg/dose for those \<70 years) , pregabalin 50 mg po 3 times a day, and oxycodone (oxynorm) 5-10mg 4 hourly po as required for breakthrough pain (Pain score \> 4/10)

Recordings and Measurements Research personnel unaware of patient randomization performed all clinical assessments. General Demographic data collected included: age, gender, height, weight, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Status and BMI.

Assessment of block function was made by checking for sensory changes to pain and temperature (using a blunt needle and ethyl chloride spray) in the distribution of the saphenous nerve at 20:00 on POD 0. A functioning adductor canal block with bupivacaine will last at least 8-12 hours. Thus all blocks,( i.e. both with and without a continuous infusion) were anticipated to still be effective at 20:00H on the day of surgery, as no blocks were performed before 10 AM. Decreased sensation in the extremity receiving the block compared with the unblocked one at the level of the medial malleolus was accepted as evidence of a functioning block.

Adverse Events Each day the assessor inquired about complications that could be attributable to the study, such as patient falls or symptoms or signs of local anesthetic toxicity. Any such events were documented. The common adverse effects of opioids (i.e. nausea, vomiting) were not recorded. However, there were no episodes of respiratory depression that required resuscitation.

Statistical Methodology Sample size was determined based on an unpublished retrospective review of knee flexion in patients who had undergone TKA at the investigators institution having received a single injection ACB. From this review, a mean maximum knee flexion of 82 (SD = 2) degrees on the second day postoperatively was assumed. A 20% difference in knee flexion was considered to be clinically significant. To achieve an 80% power and to detect a 20% difference in knee flexion with a 2-sided Type I error rate of 0.05, the calculated minimum sample was 9 patients per group. To prevent loss of power due to early withdrawal of patients, incomplete data, non-functional adductor canal blocks and absence of statistical information on a comparable continuous infusion group, 20 patients in each were included group. General demographic data in both groups were compared using unpaired, two tailed t-tests for independent samples for continuous variables, and the Chi squared test (or Fisher's Exact test as appropriate) for categorical variables. Basic statistical tools were employed to describe the data: mean, median and standard deviation. Cumulative oxycodone consumption was compared between groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for age, gender and ASA status.","Inclusion Criteria:

The hypothesis is that the implementation of routine awareness follow-up evaluation in children undergoing general anesthesia will identify that the incidence of intra-operative awareness in children is equal to or greater than in adults.","Awareness, or the unwanted recall of intra-operative events occurring during general anesthesia, is a potentially avoidable anesthetic complication that poses the risk for psychological sequelae. While the reported incidence is 0.1-0.2% in adults, this translates to \> 20,000 cases of awareness occurring in adults annually in the United States (Ekman, 2004; Myles, 2000; Sandin, 2000; Sebel, 2004; Myles, 2004). Patients who experience recall may subsequently exhibit post-traumatic stress and psychological symptoms (Sebel, 2004; Myles, 2004; Moerman, 1993; Lennmarken, 2002). Furthermore; studies have shown that up to 54% of adult patients worry about the possibility of awareness during surgery (Klafta, 1996). Subsequent to the recent studies on unintended intraoperative awareness and published data on the impact of Bispectral Index in preventing and detecting anesthesia awareness, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations has classified intraoperative awareness as a sentinel event (2004).

Limited data are available regarding the incidence and consequences of awareness in children. Studies which are available have identified a significantly higher incidence of intraoperative recall in children than has been shown in adults. McKie reported an incidence of 5% factual recall in 202 patients aged 7-14 years in 1973 (1973). The incidence of dreaming was reported as 11%. Hobbs, in 1988, reported a 19% incidence of dreaming and no awareness in 120 pediatric patients who received the ""Liverpool anesthetic technique"" (N20, O2, relaxant). Ranta reported 0.4% awareness in 4800 patients aged 12 years or older, with the youngest patient demonstrating undisputed awareness at 20 years of age (1998). More recently, Lopez et. al., found an 8% incidence of awareness in children 6-16 years of age, with a significant relationship between multiple attempts to secure the airway and the likelihood of awareness (2004). Most recently, a study published in 2005 by Davidson, et. al., found an incidence of 0.8% in 864 children aged 5-12 years of age with general anesthesia as is practiced in Australia. Likely explanations for more frequent awareness in children include altered anesthetic pharmacology in children and differences in the practice of pediatric anesthesia.

Post-operative behavior changes including emergence delirium, general anxiety, nighttime crying, enuresis, separation anxiety and temper tantrums have been described to occur up in to 50% of children undergoing surgery (Kain, 1996). Studies have also shown a correlation between pre-operative anxiety levels of both the child and parents, and may result in a greater risk of emergence delirium and later maladaptive behaviors. These results have not demonstrated a cause-effect relationship (Kain, 2004). Evaluating for intra-operative awareness or unwanted recall of intra-operative events with or without depth of anesthesia monitoring, may add to the knowledge base for causal factors in postoperative maladaptive behavior changes in the pediatric population.

The JCAHO Sentinel Event Alert, Issue 32, dated October 6, 2004, describes recommendations for health care organizations which perform procedures under general anesthesia, for the prevention and detection of intra-operative awareness. Specific recommendations include: identification of patients who are at higher risk for intraoperative awareness, appropriate follow-up of all patients, including children, who have undergone general anesthesia, and identification, management and, if appropriate, referral of patients who have experienced awareness.

Academisch Medisch Centrum - Universiteit van Amsterdam (AMC-UvA),OTHER,NCT01499979,Hypothermic Perfusion During Hemihepatectomy,In Situ Hypothermic Perfusion During Right Hemihepatectomy,"Rationale

Currently, hepatic resection is often the only curative treatment for primary or secondary hepatic malignancies and is also frequently performed in patients with benign liver tumors to prevent malignant transformation and/or alleviate symptoms. Liver resections are nowadays associated with low mortality and acceptable morbidity. As result of that, an increasing number of patients is currently under consideration for resection of more complex or large tumors, thus requiring extensive resection procedures. Application of vascular exclusion (i.e., clamping of the portal vein and hepatic artery) during such procedures reduces blood loss, which is one of the most important factors affecting peri-operative outcomes. However, vascular exclusion leads to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury as an inevitable side-effect, which adversely impacts postoperative liver function and regeneration. Additional cooling of the liver by means of hypothermic perfusion is expected to further reduce intraoperative blood loss, as well as to protect the liver from I/R injury. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to cool the future remnant liver (FRL) in situ during right hemihepatectomy under vascular exclusion. Consequently, an overall improvement in postoperative outcomes is expected due to a decrease in intraoperative blood loss, reduced parenchymal damage, and a better ability of the liver remnant to regenerate.

Objective

To reduce intraoperative blood loss and enhance tolerance of the FRL to I/R injury during right hemihepatectomy under vascular exclusion by means of in situ hypothermic perfusion with retrograde outflow (R-IHP) of the FRL.

Study design

The study is designed as a prospective randomized pilot study in 18 patients (9 interventions and 9 controls) to assess the effects of the proposed intervention. Additionally, 4 patients will be included separately for assessment of the intervention's feasibility prior to randomized inclusion.

Study population

Eligible patients for participation in this study are those planned to undergo right hemihepatectomy under vascular inflow occlusion because of a malignant or benign liver tumor, and who do not suffer from any hepatic co-morbidity that might influence postoperative outcomes (i.e., severe steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, or hepatitis B/C infection).

Intervention

During right hemihepatectomy, the FRL of patients allocated to the intervention group will be perfused with a chilled perfusion solution (i.e., lactated Ringer's solution).",,"Inclusion Criteria:

San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital,OTHER,NCT01572584,Lung Ultrasound in the Evaluation of Pneumothorax Size,Accuracy of Lung Ultrasound in the Prediction of Pneumothorax Volume Assessed by CT Scan,"Background

* Assessment of the percentage of lung collapse is crucial in the therapeutic decision-making of pneumothorax.
* The methods normally used to this purpose are radiological. Computerized tomography scan (CT) is highly accurate because it allows the exact evaluation of the volume of the air layer. However, in clinical practice assessment of the volume of pneumothorax mainly relies on the measurement of the inter-pleural distance at conventional chest radiography (CXR). This latter method is inaccurate.
* Lung ultrasound is a new method highly accurate in the first diagnosis of pneumothorax, with a sensitivity superior to CXR and similar to CT in case of traumatic pneumothorax.
* The scientific community is actually debating about the usefulness of lung ultrasound in the quantification of pneumothorax \[\]. Lung ultrasound can assess the superficial extension of the pneumothorax, but cannot evaluate its volume.

Aim

* Main purpose of the study is to compare measurement of the superficial extension of pneumothorax on the chest wall obtained by lung ultrasound, to the evaluation of the air volume performed by CT in patients with pneumothorax.
* The main hypothesis of the study is that the cut-off between small (\<11% of lung collapse) and large (\>11% of lung collapse) pneumothorax can be identified by a lung ultrasound evaluation of the superficial extension of pneumothorax.
* Second purpose of the study is to compare the accuracies of lung ultrasound and CXR in predicting the volume of pneumothorax assessed by CT.
* Secondary hypothesis is that lung ultrasound demonstrates greater accuracy in the prediction of volume of pneumothorax and percentage of lung collapse.

Computerized tomography scan (CT) is highly accurate because it allows the exact evaluation of the volume of the air layer. However, in clinical practice assessment of the volume of pneumothorax mainly relies on the measurement of the inter-pleural distance at conventional chest radiography (CXR). This latter method is inaccurate. * Lung ultrasound is a new method highly accurate in the first diagnosis of pneumothorax, with a sensitivity superior to CXR and similar to CT in case of traumatic pneumothorax. * The scientific community is actually debating about the usefulness of lung ultrasound in the quantification of pneumothorax \[\]. Lung ultrasound can assess the superficial extension of the pneumothorax, but cannot evaluate its volume. Aim * Main purpose of the study is to compare measurement of the superficial extension of pneumothorax on the chest wall obtained by lung ultrasound, to the evaluation of the air volume performed by CT in patients with pneumothorax. * The main hypothesis of the study is that the cut-off between small (\<11% of lung collapse) and large (\>11% of lung collapse) pneumothorax can be identified by a lung ultrasound evaluation of the superficial extension of pneumothorax. * Second purpose of the study is to compare the accuracies of lung ultrasound and CXR in predicting the volume of pneumothorax assessed by CT. * Secondary hypothesis is that lung ultrasound demonstrates greater accuracy in the prediction of volume of pneumothorax and percentage of lung collapse. Methods * Patients with a diagnosis of pneumothorax confirmed at CT are prospectively enrolled and submitted to lung ultrasound within 20 min from the CT study. * Different locations of the sonographic ""lung point"" on the chest wall (i.e. the point on the chest wall where the sonographic pattern of the normally aerated lung alternates with the pathologic sonographic pattern of pneumothorax) are compared with different volumes of pneumothorax measured by CT.

University of Illinois at Chicago,OTHER,NCT02337179,Male Circumcision Services for HIV Prevention in the Dominican Republic,A Pilot Study to Introduce Male Circumcision (MC) Services to Prevent HIV Infection in Two High Prevalence Areas of the Dominican Republic (DR),The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of introducing voluntary medical male circumcision as a form of HIV prevention in high HIV prevalence areas in the Dominican Republic.,"Voluntary Medical Male circumcision (VMMC) is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. Observational data and randomized controlled trails (RCTs) conducted in Africa(1,2,3) suggest that the procedure reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by 50-76% in heterosexual males. VMMC has also been shown to reduce the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections (STI), including herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papilloma virus (HPV) in men(4), and Chlamydia(5), trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and HPV in their female partners(6).

The results of the RCT's are generating increased demand for safe and affordable MC services in areas of moderate-to-high HIV prevalence where the MC rates are low. Latin America is a region where circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic (DR), which is the focus of this study, a 2007 nationwide household survey found that only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 were circumcised(8).

AIDS is the leading cause of death in the Caribbean basin among adults aged 15-44 years. There are approximately 240,000 people currently living with the disease, most of them residing in the Dominican Republic (DR) and Haiti(9). The prevalence of HIV infection in the DR is approximately 0.8% nationwide(8) but it is higher in selected high-risk populations, such as among people living in the ""bateyes"", the small towns surrounding sugar cane plantations, where the prevalence is 3.2%(10). In pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the Altagracia province HIV seroprevalence is 4.5 %(11). One of the areas of highest prevalence (1.2%) in the country is Region V of health, which includes the provinces of La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, La Romana and San Pedro de Macorís. Prevalence is also higher in the urban slums of the capital city, Santo Domingo.

The public health impact of introducing MC as a strategy to prevent HIV/STI transmission in areas of high HIV/STI prevalence and low MC rates can be significant. In addition to decreasing the rates of HIV and other STI, the intervention could indirectly help decrease the rates of HPV associated cervical cancer. The study proposed here is to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate pilot MC services in selected sites to assess the acceptability, uptake, safety and demand for these services, and to use these data to develop, in collaboration with the Dominican Ministry of Health (MoH), a proposal to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for support of operations research concerning the safety, uptake, and efficacy of MC interventions in the DR.

1. Specific Aims:

   Based on the results of numerous observational studies and the three RCTs the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have endorsed VMMC as a biomedical intervention for HIV prevention. As such, countries with a high prevalence of HIV in the population are encouraged to examine the feasibility of offering MC services as part of the portfolio of HIV prevention strategies at a national level. The specific aims for this project are:
   1. To develop culturally appropriate education materials about the benefits of VMMC for clients attending pilot healthcare centers.
   2. To train a core group of providers on proper surgical and counseling techniques to provide comprehensive VMMC services.
   3. To determine the acceptability, uptake and demand for MC services in key areas of high HIV prevalence.

      H1: The acceptability and uptake among high risk men will be around 60%.
   4. To assess the safety and adverse events of performing circumcision in resource constrained settings.

      H2: VMMC will result in a complication rate of less than 2%.
   5. To assess sexual risk behaviors, perceptions of sexual function and sexual pleasure in men before and after VMMC. H3: there will be no differences in risk behaviors, sexual function and pleasure after VMMC.
   6. Estimate point prevalence of most common STI in a subset of circumcised men and preserve a small sample of blood to test future scientific hypothesis and/or newer testing techniques as they become available.
   7. To build collaborations with the MoH and other partners in the DR and at UIC to develop a proposal to NIMH for operational research in the context of larger scale MC service provision.
2. Background and significance:

b.1. Male Circumcision to Prevent HIV Transmission Male circumcision is perhaps one of the oldest surgical procedures performed on humans. The millenary practice of removing the male foreskin has cultural, religious and medical dimensions that have been widely studied. Around the world, the procedure is mostly performed for religious reasons in persons of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Medical indications for MC include phimosis, paraphimosis and balanitis, among others(12). Early evidence of a relationship between MC and HIV infection came from a number of smaller, mostly observational studies, done in Africa(13). These historical data were validated with the completion of three large RCTs in South Africa, Kenya and Uganda, which have shown an overall decrease of 50-76% in the risk of acquiring HIV infection in circumcised males when compared to controls(1,2,3).

The pathogenesis of the initial infection at the level of the foreskin involves tissue macrophages, cell receptors and a moist, poorly keratinized inner prepuce. The first cellular target of the HIV virion on the human genitalia are the tissue dendritic cells in the lamina propria of the submucosa(14). These cells express surface CD4 receptors and CCR5 co-receptors for which HIV has high affinity. In intact human skin, the dendritic cells are shielded from the outer environment by the relatively thick layer of keratin covering the surface of the epithelia. Tissue studies of the human foreskin have shown that the inner lining of the prepuce, exposed during a penile erection, has a thin keratin layer that is very susceptible to microscopic abrasions and can expose the tissue macrophages making them vulnerable to infection by HIV(15).

b.2. MC for STI prevention: MC is an effective strategy to decrease the risk of infection with HIV and other STI in heterosexual males. A beneficial effect has also been observed in decreasing the risk of STI in females. The RCTs confirmed that VMMC decreases herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) acquisition by 29%, and HPV prevalence by 34% in men(4). Among female partners of circumcised men, bacterial vaginosis was reduced by 40%, and trichomonas vaginalis infection was reduced by 48%(6). Genital ulcer disease was also reduced among males and their female partners by approximately half(16).

b.3. HIV in the Caribbean and the Dominican Republic: The significant decrease in the rate of HIV acquisition observed among circumcised males who participated in the African RCT is generating an increased demand for safe and affordable VMMC services in areas of high HIV prevalence where the procedure is not routinely performed. Latin America is one of such areas where routine circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic, only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 years are circumcised(8). The Caribbean is the region of the world with the highest HIV prevalence outside of sub-Saharan Africa (1.0%)(9). Approximately 240,000 individuals are currently living with the disease. Among the Caribbean countries, the Dominican Republic and Haiti report the highest prevalence in the region. According to data from a recent In the DR, the prevalence of HIV infection is 0.8% nationwide(8), however, the numbers are higher in selected populations and in certain geographic locations.

The Dominican healthcare system is administratively divided in 9 regions, which include the country's 31 provinces. Region 0 of health includes the National District and the provinces of Santo Domingo and Monte Plata. The city of Santo Domingo is the capital and financial center of the DR. It has an estimated population of 2.7 million people spread in an area of about 1,400 KM2. 90% of the population lives in an urban setting in this province(17). The overall prevalence of HIV is around 0.7 % in the entire region but is higher in vulnerable groups such as commercial sex workers (CSW) (3.3%), Men who Have Sex with Men (MSM) (5.9%) and drug users (7.1%)(18).

Regions V and VII report the highest prevalence of HIV in the country, 1.2 % and 1.5% respectively(8). Specific populations within these provinces have rates of HIV considerably higher than the national average. For instance, prevalence is 3.2% in the bateyes, the small communities surrounding sugar cane plantations, where a mixed population of Dominicans and Haitian migrant workers cohabitate. Our team has conducted preliminary studies in the Altagracia Province, part of Region V, since it reports the highest province-specific HIV rates and the lowest circumcision rates in the country. A survey of pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the province found an HIV seroprevalence of 4.5 %11. The prevalence of HIV is 5.2% in CSW, 7.6% in MSM and 8.5 % among drug users(18).

c) Preliminary studies: The parent study for this project is a RCT of VMMC to reduce HIV incidence in Kisumu, Kenya whose principal investigator is Prof. Robert C. Bailey, a co-investigator in the current proposal(3). The main objective of that trial was to assess the effectiveness of VMMC in reducing HIV incidence in young, sexually active men. The protective effect found in an intent-to-treat analysis was 53% and in an as treated analysis adjusting for cross-overs and men found to be HIV seropositive at baseline estimated the protective effect to be 60%. Adverse events related to the surgical procedure were few, just 1.5%. Behavioral disinhibition (risk compensation) on the part of circumcised men was small and not significant.

Drs. Brito and Bailey conducted a feasibility study of healthcare facilities in the Altagracia province in the Dominican Republic during June and July of 2007. A total of 37 healthcare facilities were surveyed. The study found that most facilities lacked appropriate equipment to perform surgical procedures and only four (11%) had a surgical theater. 43 healthcare workers, the majority of them physicians (91%), were interviewed for the study. Only 23 % of the personnel had experience performing MC and a significant number of providers (76%) believed they needed comprehensive training in the procedure prior to starting a MC program. Quantitative and qualitative studies to assess the acceptability of MC among men, women and providers in the Altagracia Province were conducted in 2008. In these studies, 73% of men thought that MC improved hygiene and approximately one third knew that it reduces the risk of penile cancer or STI. Only a small percentage (21%) knew that MC helps prevent HIV infection. When first asked, 29% of participants reported that they would be willing to be circumcised if the procedure was offered to them. However, after an educational session detailing the benefits of the procedure for HIV and STI prevention, the acceptability increased to 67%. Such increment was also observed in previous studies done in Botswana(19) and Thailand(20)where acceptability increased from 61 % to 81% and from 14% to 66%, respectively, after a similar information session. In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of men's acceptability of circumcision, before the information session, were Haitian nationality (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.41), thinking that circumcision improves hygiene (OR=2.78, 95% CI 1.29-6.0) and not believing that having a circumcision decreases sexual pleasure (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.20-3.94). These results have been published (21, 22).

We also conducted 13 focus group discussions (FGD), 6 with women and 7 with men, each consisting of 6-10 participants (mean=7.9, SD=1.3). One additional FGD was conducted with six physicians, two males and four females, working in rural clinics around the province. Findings of this qualitative study showed that a significant number of participants might be willing to be circumcised, or agree with circumcision for their partners, to improve hygiene, prevent diseases and treat medical conditions, such as phimosis, which can result in pain during intercourse. These results are consistent with our quantitative study on men's acceptability of MC. Perhaps one of the most important findings of the FGD was the enthusiastic endorsement of MC by women, a fact that has potential implications for the successful implementation of a circumcision program in the country (22).

Overall, our preliminary data suggest that men are willing to be circumcised provided they receive information about the benefits of the procedure. Before recommending the introduction of VMMC services as part of a comprehensive package of HIV and other STI prevention strategies, these findings need to be confirmed by studying the uptake of VMMC among sexually active men in selected clinics that serve clients in high prevalence areas. In addition, there is need to identify potential barriers to offering MC services in high risk communities prior to proposing to implement a large-scale intervention. In order to properly address these concerns, we will conduct a pilot study that will provide the necessary preliminary data to design a proposal to the NIMH to conduct operational research around a large-scale implementation project.

d) Experimental design and methods: d.1. Pilot study design The study will be conducted at two sites: the STI clinic at Instituto Dermatologico and Cirugia de Piel (IDCP) in Santo Domingo and the Clínica de Familia in La Romana, Dominican Republic. These sites have been selected on the basis of: 1) high numbers of male clients at risk for HIV and STI infection in communities served by the clinics; 2) high level of acceptability of MC among men in the communities served by the clinics (bateyes of Altagracia); 3) the availability of service providers willing to be trained; 4) the availability of equipment; and 5) the availability of infrastructure, including a minor surgical theater, sterilization facilities and HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and STI management.

During the first phase of the study, culturally appropriate educational material will be created in Spanish by the principal investigator and local collaborators. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews will be conducted with members of the community to learn the educational needs of the community and to assess their opinions on how to best deliver the information on MC that will be contained in the educational materials.

We plan to conduct the FGD in the communities served by the Instituto Dermatologico and the Clinica de Familia, the two main study sites. The plan is to assemble groups of 6-12 participants from the population living in these communities. Community leaders, health promoters, teachers and primary care physicians will be asked to help identify and invite volunteers from their respective communities to participate in the study. There will be no difference in the recruitment process for men and women. They will be recruited from the same venues (schools, clubs, community centers) . Participants will be invited to participate by research personnel with the help of local leaders. These local leaders may be of both genders and will help recruit participants from either gender. The focus groups will be gender-specific. The moderator will explain the purpose of the study to participants. Verbal consent will be obtained from all participants and an information sheet outlining the objectives of the study, their privacy and confidentiality rights and our contact information will be distributed. The document will highlight the voluntary nature of the subject's participation and their right to leave the discussion at anytime if they so desire. The study meets the definition of ""minimal risk"", therefore, we are requesting a waiver of written consent. We believe this will further preserve the confidentiality of the participants. The goal is to conduct no more than 15 FGD. Participants in the FGD will be divided by gender. We plan to recruit approximately the same number of men and women for the FGD.

In addition to the FGD, several in-depth individual interviews may be conducted using the same guide than in the FGD. A script will be followed to conduct the FGD. The discussions will be stimulated by using a list of carefully crafted questions on the subject of MC. These questions are designed to obtain information on the following aspects relevant to our investigation:

1. Perception of the population about the frequency of MC in community men.
2. Opinions on the best way to educate men in the community about the benefits of circumcision.
3. Opinions about the content of the educational materials educational and how information should be delivered.
4. Where should these educational material be posted or distributed to capture the most number of men.
5. Opinions on the best venue to organize educational sessions featuring a circumcised man that would be available to answer question from men in the community about his satisfaction with his circumcision.
6. Perceptions about who would be a good person to educate men about the benefits of circumcision in the community.
7. Opinions on the best way to involve women in the community in a campaign to recruit men for circumcision.

The moderator and a research assistant (RA) will lead the discussions. All FGD will be audiotaped and detailed notes will be taken. The content of the recordings will be transcribed shortly after the end of the meeting. The PI, a native Spanish speaker, will be responsible for translating the recordings from Spanish to English. The English-version transcripts will be coded using the program ATLAS.ti vers. 5.2 based on template of topical categories drawn from questions and issues covered in the discussion guides and from themes emerging from the discussions themselves. The interviews will be conducted by one of the co-investigators. Verbal consent will be obtained and a document containing information about the study will be provided to the participants. All data obtained during this study, including recordings and notes will be de-indentified. The names of the participants will not be recorded to protect their confidentiality.

Data Management All notes, audio recordings and study material obtained during the FGD and interviews will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in an office at the Instituto Dermatologico, Dominican Republic and in the PI's office at the UIC campus upon the investigator's return to Chicago. All data will be de-identified to preserve confidentiality. Names will not be recorded. Verbal informed consent will be sought; there will be no signed consent forms to identify individuals. The participants have the right to review the audio recordings. If a participant requests to listen to the recordings, one of the co-investigators will schedule an appointment for the subject to come to the research site and, in an unoccupied office, will playback the recording for him/her and answer all the questions that the subject may have. If the participant wishes to erase part or all of his/her responses, it will be done on the spot, in his/her presence, using the digital recorder. The data obtained during these FGD and interviews will inform the design of the educational materials. Once created, these materials will be tested for clarity and appropriateness of language by soliciting input from community health promoters and peer advocates working at the IDCP. Once it is determined that the educational materials are suitable to distribute to clients, we will submit to the Institutional Review Board for approval. Once approved, pamphlets and posters will be printed and distributed at the site clinics and the surrounding communities.

During the second phase, selected providers will be trained. This will include counselors in HIV counseling and testing, and medical doctors by an experienced urologist on the appropriate technique for VMMC using the ""Manual for Male Circumcision Under Local Anesthesia"" published by WHO, UNAIDS. Supervision and evaluation of trainees will be conducted following the protocol used during the parent RCT.

Study subjects will be recruited in a variety of ways. In Santo Domingo, fliers will be posted in bars and night clubs frequented by men at high risk for HIV/STI acquisition. A group of volunteer commercial sex workers working on an HIV vaccine trial will be asked to refer their clients for the study. Men seeking care for STI at the clinic will also be invited to participate. In La Romana, men attending the Clínica de Familia will be invited to participate. In addition, a group of outreach workers will visit the ""bateyes"", the communities surrounding sugar cane fields where migrant laborers live, to educate men about MC and invite them to participate in the study.

Men between 18-40 years will be provided with information about the study and will be invited to participate. If they express an interest in participating, informed consent will be obtained. The participant will go over the consent form with the counselor, who will assess his level of understanding and answer any questions. If there are no temporary or permanent excluding conditions, the participant will be asked to give informed consent for enrollment in the study. Men who elect to be circumcised will be fully informed about the benefits and risks of the procedure, as well as the surgical method to be used. After the informed consent is signed, a ""Locator Information Form"" containing confidential data such as subject's name and address will be completed. Only selected research staff will have access to this information, which will be filed separate from the rest of the study forms. A de-identified ""demographic information form and behavioral questionnaire"" will be completed next.

Testing for HIV infection will be carried out using a rapid test. The test kits to be used are the synthetic peptide test, Determine HIV 1/2, and the recombinant antigen test Unigold HIV 1/2 Recombinant. Results are provided to the clients, with appropriate counseling, at the same visit. Participants are taught to observe, read and interpret the tests for themselves in the company of the counselor. Men with positive results will be informed of their HIV status and will be followed-up at the study clinic and referred for a confirmatory HIV-ELISA and, if confirmed, for HIV treatment. Serologic testing for HSV-2, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV), and hepatitis C antibody (HCV) will be performed using an ELISA test. A serum Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR) will be performed to test for syphilis. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing will be performed in urine using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. All participants who test positive for Chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea will be offered treatment free of charge. Participants who test positive for HSV-2 and have active genital lesions will be offered treatment free of charge. Those who test positive but have no active lesions will be counseled on safe sex practices and the risk of transmission to their partners as there is no recommended treatment for asymptomatic individuals infected with HSV-2. HIV, HBV, and HCV positive participants will be referred for evaluation and treatment at Clinica de la Familia in La Romana as these are chronic diseases that require long term treatment usually covered under government programs. If a participant is found to have a treatable STD and he does not return to the site, he will be called by the study investigators using the phone number provided by the participant at enrolment to ensure treatment is provided. If there is a temporary, medically curable condition present, such that it would be advisable to defer potential surgery, then the participant will be treated and asked to return for re-evaluation for study eligibility when he is cured. Men found to have an STD or to be HIV-positive will be referred for immediate care. Once enrollment is completed, participants will be given an appointment for the surgery.

Circumcision will be performed soon after informed consent, preferably within a few days. All surgeries will be done under local anesthesia in a clinic by trained clinicians, using the standardized forceps-guided method described by Krieger and colleagues and contained in the WHO MC manual(23). Circumcised men will be counseled to refrain from sex for six weeks post-surgery and counseled about risk of HIV infection through open wounds during the healing process. They will be checked for complications and asked about their sexual activity seven days after the procedure. Men without complications will be followed six months after surgery with behavioral risk assessment, HIV testing and counseling. Men may come to the study sites for unscheduled visits at any time during the 6 month follow-up. All men will be counseled at enrollment and all follow-up visits to reduce their risk for HIV infection by consistent condom use and, where applicable, reductions in numbers of sex partners. Counselling on condom use and sexual risk reduction will be provided by trained, experienced, native-speaking counsellors.

MC services will be offered at the selected two sites for 1 year. The estimated cost per circumcision is $40. We expect to recruit five clients per week at each site for a total convenience sample of 575 subjects in one year. During the second year of the project, we will continue to assess behavioral risk factors for the first six months and work on analyzing the data during the last semester of the project.

Circumcision Procedure Prior to surgery, the clinician will obtain a complete medical history and perform a physical exam.

A brief description of the procedure follows. The patient lies on his back in a comfortable position. The pubic area is shaved clean with a disposable razor and the hair is picked up with a dressing tape. The surgeon scrubs up and puts on 2 pairs of sterile gloves. The client's skin is prepared with Betadine solution, making sure that the inner surface of the prepuce and the glans are clean and the skin is dry. The outer pair of gloves is then removed. The client is draped with two drapes and a center ""O"" towel, and then, using 2% lidocaine without epinephrine, a dorsal nerve block and a field block with special attention to the ventral nerve, is performed. Normally, no more than 10ml of 2% lidocaine will be used. The anesthetic effect of the nerve block is checked, and revised if necessary. The prepuce is held with two mosquito forceps, one on each lateral aspect, then a curved mark is made with sterile disposable marking pens, outlining the planned surgical cut. The mark is made one cm proximal to the coronal sulcus all round, and parallel to the coronal sulcus. The prepuce is clamped along the mark with a Kocher clamp while retracting the glans, ensuring that the glans itself is not clamped. The prepuce is excised using a surgical blade along the mark. Bleeders are identified, clamped and tied. They are sutured, and if necessary ligated, using 3/0 plain catgut. After ligating all the bleeders, the area is irrigated with normal saline and then inspected for more bleeders, which are identified and tied. Using 3/0 chromic catgut on a taper 4/8 circle needle, a U-shaped horizontal mattress stitch is made on the ventral side of the penis (frenulum) to join the skin at the ""V"" shaped cut, which is then tied and tagged with a mosquito forceps. Using vertical mattress stitches, four quarters are tagged, and a vertical mattress stitch added, after which a simple stitch is put at the center of every two mattress stitches (a total of at least 16 stitches). The area is irrigated with normal saline and other simple stitches added as required. The wound is dressed with Sofratulle, then with a regular dressing bandage and a strapping. The client is advised to rest for 30 minutes, and if stable, discharged home on mild analgesics. Upon completion of the procedure the surgeon completes a procedure form. The excised foreskin tissue is taken to the laboratory with no identifiers, discarded with other laboratory waste, and incinerated with other biological waste within three days. Participants will be given verbal and written instructions on postoperative wound care and counseled to refrain from sexual activity for at least six weeks after the procedure. They will also be encouraged to come to the clinic or contact a clinician at any time with medical problems.

Day 7 Post Circumcision Visit: Circumcised men will be asked to return to the clinic 7 days after the procedure to check the wound, to see if it is healing properly, to check for complications, and to ask about their sexual activity, their level of pain, resumption of work or other activities, and their satisfaction with the procedure and care at the clinic. As with all visits, any adverse events will be recorded. Blood and urine will be collected for STD testing at this visit.

Six month post operative visit: During this visit a brief exam to confirmed proper wound healing will be performed. A behavioral and satisfaction questionnaire will be administered.

Unscheduled Follow-up Visits: Ad hoc clinic visits will be encouraged to check and treat for complications of the procedure. At such visits, medical examinations and laboratory testing will be conducted as indicated, and appropriate treatment provided free of charge. Medical referral will be made if required.

d.2. Data analysis Each enrolled participant will be assigned a confidential code, which will be used in all study forms. Only the principal investigators and research assistants will have access to the ""locator information form"" containing personal information. This form, which links the subject's confidential code to his name, will be stored in separate locked filing cabinets at the local principal investigator's offices. The locator information forms, which contain the personal information on the subjects, will be kept for 1.5 years in case we need to contact one of the subjects for an unexpected occurrence or with a question. After the end of that period, these locator forms will be destroyed at the research offices at the respective study sites using a micro cut shredder. Data will be coded and entered into computer datasets by trained personnel. Data extracted from questionnaires will be tabulated and analyzed using SAS statistical software version 9.1. and will be analyzed at the University of Illinois, College of Medicine, in Chicago by the principal investigator A questionnaire asking specific demographic information will be administered. The following variables will be recorded: age, religion, place of residence (urban/rural), education level, occupation and marital status. Simple descriptive statistics will be calculated and the effect of these variables on the willingness, uptake and rate of adverse events of VMMC will be estimated. In addition, we plan to estimate the effect of demographic characteristics on sexual behavior and disinhibition after the procedure.","Inclusion Criteria:

Voluntary Medical Male circumcision (VMMC) is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. Observational data and randomized controlled trails (RCTs) conducted in Africa(1,2,3) suggest that the procedure reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by 50-76% in heterosexual males. VMMC has also been shown to reduce the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections (STI), including herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papilloma virus (HPV) in men(4), and Chlamydia(5), trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and HPV in their female partners(6). The results of the RCT's are generating increased demand for safe and affordable MC services in areas of moderate-to-high HIV prevalence where the MC rates are low. Latin America is a region where circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic (DR), which is the focus of this study, a 2007 nationwide household survey found that only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 were circumcised(8). AIDS is the leading cause of death in the Caribbean basin among adults aged 15-44 years. There are approximately 240,000 people currently living with the disease, most of them residing in the Dominican Republic (DR) and Haiti(9). The prevalence of HIV infection in the DR is approximately 0.8% nationwide(8) but it is higher in selected high-risk populations, such as among people living in the ""bateyes"", the small towns surrounding sugar cane plantations, where the prevalence is 3.2%(10). In pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the Altagracia province HIV seroprevalence is 4.5 %(11). One of the areas of highest prevalence (1.2%) in the country is Region V of health, which includes the provinces of La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, La Romana and San Pedro de Macorís. Prevalence is also higher in the urban slums of the capital city, Santo Domingo. The public health impact of introducing MC as a strategy to prevent HIV/STI transmission in areas of high HIV/STI prevalence and low MC rates can be significant. In addition to decreasing the rates of HIV and other STI, the intervention could indirectly help decrease the rates of HPV associated cervical cancer. The study proposed here is to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate pilot MC services in selected sites to assess the acceptability, uptake, safety and demand for these services, and to use these data to develop, in collaboration with the Dominican Ministry of Health (MoH), a proposal to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for support of operations research concerning the safety, uptake, and efficacy of MC interventions in the DR. 1. Specific Aims: Based on the results of numerous observational studies and the three RCTs the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have endorsed VMMC as a biomedical intervention for HIV prevention. As such, countries with a high prevalence of HIV in the population are encouraged to examine the feasibility of offering MC services as part of the portfolio of HIV prevention strategies at a national level. The specific aims for this project are: 1. To develop culturally appropriate education materials about the benefits of VMMC for clients attending pilot healthcare centers. 2. To train a core group of providers on proper surgical and counseling techniques to provide comprehensive VMMC services. 3. To determine the acceptability, uptake and demand for MC services in key areas of high HIV prevalence. H1: The acceptability and uptake among high risk men will be around 60%. 4. To assess the safety and adverse events of performing circumcision in resource constrained settings. H2: VMMC will result in a complication rate of less than 2%. 5. To assess sexual risk behaviors, perceptions of sexual function and sexual pleasure in men before and after VMMC. H3: there will be no differences in risk behaviors, sexual function and pleasure after VMMC. 6. Estimate point prevalence of most common STI in a subset of circumcised men and preserve a small sample of blood to test future scientific hypothesis and/or newer testing techniques as they become available. 7. To build collaborations with the MoH and other partners in the DR and at UIC to develop a proposal to NIMH for operational research in the context of larger scale MC service provision. 2. Background and significance: b.1. Male Circumcision to Prevent HIV Transmission Male circumcision is perhaps one of the oldest surgical procedures performed on humans. The millenary practice of removing the male foreskin has cultural, religious and medical dimensions that have been widely studied. Around the world, the procedure is mostly performed for religious reasons in persons of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Medical indications for MC include phimosis, paraphimosis and balanitis, among others(12). Early evidence of a relationship between MC and HIV infection came from a number of smaller, mostly observational studies, done in Africa(13). These historical data were validated with the completion of three large RCTs in South Africa, Kenya and Uganda, which have shown an overall decrease of 50-76% in the risk of acquiring HIV infection in circumcised males when compared to controls(1,2,3). The pathogenesis of the initial infection at the level of the foreskin involves tissue macrophages, cell receptors and a moist, poorly keratinized inner prepuce. The first cellular target of the HIV virion on the human genitalia are the tissue dendritic cells in the lamina propria of the submucosa(14). These cells express surface CD4 receptors and CCR5 co-receptors for which HIV has high affinity. In intact human skin, the dendritic cells are shielded from the outer environment by the relatively thick layer of keratin covering the surface of the epithelia. Tissue studies of the human foreskin have shown that the inner lining of the prepuce, exposed during a penile erection, has a thin keratin layer that is very susceptible to microscopic abrasions and can expose the tissue macrophages making them vulnerable to infection by HIV(15). b.2. MC for STI prevention: MC is an effective strategy to decrease the risk of infection with HIV and other STI in heterosexual males. A beneficial effect has also been observed in decreasing the risk of STI in females. The RCTs confirmed that VMMC decreases herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) acquisition by 29%, and HPV prevalence by 34% in men(4). Among female partners of circumcised men, bacterial vaginosis was reduced by 40%, and trichomonas vaginalis infection was reduced by 48%(6). Genital ulcer disease was also reduced among males and their female partners by approximately half(16). b.3. HIV in the Caribbean and the Dominican Republic: The significant decrease in the rate of HIV acquisition observed among circumcised males who participated in the African RCT is generating an increased demand for safe and affordable VMMC services in areas of high HIV prevalence where the procedure is not routinely performed. Latin America is one of such areas where routine circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic, only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 years are circumcised(8). The Caribbean is the region of the world with the highest HIV prevalence outside of sub-Saharan Africa (1.0%)(9). Approximately 240,000 individuals are currently living with the disease. Among the Caribbean countries, the Dominican Republic and Haiti report the highest prevalence in the region. According to data from a recent In the DR, the prevalence of HIV infection is 0.8% nationwide(8), however, the numbers are higher in selected populations and in certain geographic locations. The Dominican healthcare system is administratively divided in 9 regions, which include the country's 31 provinces. Region 0 of health includes the National District and the provinces of Santo Domingo and Monte Plata. The city of Santo Domingo is the capital and financial center of the DR. It has an estimated population of 2.7 million people spread in an area of about 1,400 KM2. 90% of the population lives in an urban setting in this province(17). The overall prevalence of HIV is around 0.7 % in the entire region but is higher in vulnerable groups such as commercial sex workers (CSW) (3.3%), Men who Have Sex with Men (MSM) (5.9%) and drug users (7.1%)(18). Regions V and VII report the highest prevalence of HIV in the country, 1.2 % and 1.5% respectively(8). Specific populations within these provinces have rates of HIV considerably higher than the national average. For instance, prevalence is 3.2% in the bateyes, the small communities surrounding sugar cane plantations, where a mixed population of Dominicans and Haitian migrant workers cohabitate. Our team has conducted preliminary studies in the Altagracia Province, part of Region V, since it reports the highest province-specific HIV rates and the lowest circumcision rates in the country. A survey of pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the province found an HIV seroprevalence of 4.5 %11. The prevalence of HIV is 5.2% in CSW, 7.6% in MSM and 8.5 % among drug users(18). c) Preliminary studies: The parent study for this project is a RCT of VMMC to reduce HIV incidence in Kisumu, Kenya whose principal investigator is Prof. Robert C. Bailey, a co-investigator in the current proposal(3). The main objective of that trial was to assess the effectiveness of VMMC in reducing HIV incidence in young, sexually active men. The protective effect found in an intent-to-treat analysis was 53% and in an as treated analysis adjusting for cross-overs and men found to be HIV seropositive at baseline estimated the protective effect to be 60%. Adverse events related to the surgical procedure were few, just 1.5%. Behavioral disinhibition (risk compensation) on the part of circumcised men was small and not significant. Drs. Brito and Bailey conducted a feasibility study of healthcare facilities in the Altagracia province in the Dominican Republic during June and July of 2007. A total of 37 healthcare facilities were surveyed. The study found that most facilities lacked appropriate equipment to perform surgical procedures and only four (11%) had a surgical theater. 43 healthcare workers, the majority of them physicians (91%), were interviewed for the study. Only 23 % of the personnel had experience performing MC and a significant number of providers (76%) believed they needed comprehensive training in the procedure prior to starting a MC program. Quantitative and qualitative studies to assess the acceptability of MC among men, women and providers in the Altagracia Province were conducted in 2008. In these studies, 73% of men thought that MC improved hygiene and approximately one third knew that it reduces the risk of penile cancer or STI. Only a small percentage (21%) knew that MC helps prevent HIV infection. When first asked, 29% of participants reported that they would be willing to be circumcised if the procedure was offered to them. However, after an educational session detailing the benefits of the procedure for HIV and STI prevention, the acceptability increased to 67%. Such increment was also observed in previous studies done in Botswana(19) and Thailand(20)where acceptability increased from 61 % to 81% and from 14% to 66%, respectively, after a similar information session. In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of men's acceptability of circumcision, before the information session, were Haitian nationality (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.41), thinking that circumcision improves hygiene (OR=2.78, 95% CI 1.29-6.0) and not believing that having a circumcision decreases sexual pleasure (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.20-3.94). These results have been published (21, 22). We also conducted 13 focus group discussions (FGD), 6 with women and 7 with men, each consisting of 6-10 participants (mean=7.9, SD=1.3). One additional FGD was conducted with six physicians, two males and four females, working in rural clinics around the province. Findings of this qualitative study showed that a significant number of participants might be willing to be circumcised, or agree with circumcision for their partners, to improve hygiene, prevent diseases and treat medical conditions, such as phimosis, which can result in pain during intercourse. These results are consistent with our quantitative study on men's acceptability of MC. Perhaps one of the most important findings of the FGD was the enthusiastic endorsement of MC by women, a fact that has potential implications for the successful implementation of a circumcision program in the country (22). Overall, our preliminary data suggest that men are willing to be circumcised provided they receive information about the benefits of the procedure. Before recommending the introduction of VMMC services as part of a comprehensive package of HIV and other STI prevention strategies, these findings need to be confirmed by studying the uptake of VMMC among sexually active men in selected clinics that serve clients in high prevalence areas. In addition, there is need to identify potential barriers to offering MC services in high risk communities prior to proposing to implement a large-scale intervention. In order to properly address these concerns, we will conduct a pilot study that will provide the necessary preliminary data to design a proposal to the NIMH to conduct operational research around a large-scale implementation project. d) Experimental design and methods: d.1. Pilot study design The study will be conducted at two sites: the STI clinic at Instituto Dermatologico and Cirugia de Piel (IDCP) in Santo Domingo and the Clínica de Familia in La Romana, Dominican Republic. These sites have been selected on the basis of: 1) high numbers of male clients at risk for HIV and STI infection in communities served by the clinics; 2) high level of acceptability of MC among men in the communities served by the clinics (bateyes of Altagracia); 3) the availability of service providers willing to be trained; 4) the availability of equipment; and 5) the availability of infrastructure, including a minor surgical theater, sterilization facilities and HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and STI management. During the first phase of the study, culturally appropriate educational material will be created in Spanish by the principal investigator and local collaborators. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews will be conducted with members of the community to learn the educational needs of the community and to assess their opinions on how to best deliver the information on MC that will be contained in the educational materials. We plan to conduct the FGD in the communities served by the Instituto Dermatologico and the Clinica de Familia, the two main study sites. The plan is to assemble groups of 6-12 participants from the population living in these communities. Community leaders, health promoters, teachers and primary care physicians will be asked to help identify and invite volunteers from their respective communities to participate in the study. There will be no difference in the recruitment process for men and women. They will be recruited from the same venues (schools, clubs, community centers) . Participants will be invited to participate by research personnel with the help of local leaders. These local leaders may be of both genders and will help recruit participants from either gender. The focus groups will be gender-specific. The moderator will explain the purpose of the study to participants. Verbal consent will be obtained from all participants and an information sheet outlining the objectives of the study, their privacy and confidentiality rights and our contact information will be distributed. The document will highlight the voluntary nature of the subject's participation and their right to leave the discussion at anytime if they so desire. The study meets the definition of ""minimal risk"", therefore, we are requesting a waiver of written consent. We believe this will further preserve the confidentiality of the participants. The goal is to conduct no more than 15 FGD. Participants in the FGD will be divided by gender. We plan to recruit approximately the same number of men and women for the FGD. In addition to the FGD, several in-depth individual interviews may be conducted using the same guide than in the FGD. A script will be followed to conduct the FGD. The discussions will be stimulated by using a list of carefully crafted questions on the subject of MC. These questions are designed to obtain information on the following aspects relevant to our investigation: 1. Perception of the population about the frequency of MC in community men. 2. Opinions on the best way to educate men in the community about the benefits of circumcision. 3. Opinions about the content of the educational materials educational and how information should be delivered. 4. Where should these educational material be posted or distributed to capture the most number of men. 5. Opinions on the best venue to organize educational sessions featuring a circumcised man that would be available to answer question from men in the community about his satisfaction with his circumcision. 6. Perceptions about who would be a good person to educate men about the benefits of circumcision in the community. 7. Opinions on the best way to involve women in the community in a campaign to recruit men for circumcision. The moderator and a research assistant (RA) will lead the discussions. All FGD will be audiotaped and detailed notes will be taken. The content of the recordings will be transcribed shortly after the end of the meeting. The PI, a native Spanish speaker, will be responsible for translating the recordings from Spanish to English. The English-version transcripts will be coded using the program ATLAS.ti vers. 5.2 based on template of topical categories drawn from questions and issues covered in the discussion guides and from themes emerging from the discussions themselves. The interviews will be conducted by one of the co-investigators. Verbal consent will be obtained and a document containing information about the study will be provided to the participants. All data obtained during this study, including recordings and notes will be de-indentified. The names of the participants will not be recorded to protect their confidentiality. Data Management All notes, audio recordings and study material obtained during the FGD and interviews will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in an office at the Instituto Dermatologico, Dominican Republic and in the PI's office at the UIC campus upon the investigator's return to Chicago. All data will be de-identified to preserve confidentiality. Names will not be recorded. Verbal informed consent will be sought; there will be no signed consent forms to identify individuals. The participants have the right to review the audio recordings. If a participant requests to listen to the recordings, one of the co-investigators will schedule an appointment for the subject to come to the research site and, in an unoccupied office, will playback the recording for him/her and answer all the questions that the subject may have. If the participant wishes to erase part or all of his/her responses, it will be done on the spot, in his/her presence, using the digital recorder. The data obtained during these FGD and interviews will inform the design of the educational materials. Once created, these materials will be tested for clarity and appropriateness of language by soliciting input from community health promoters and peer advocates working at the IDCP. Once it is determined that the educational materials are suitable to distribute to clients, we will submit to the Institutional Review Board for approval. Once approved, pamphlets and posters will be printed and distributed at the site clinics and the surrounding communities. During the second phase, selected providers will be trained. This will include counselors in HIV counseling and testing, and medical doctors by an experienced urologist on the appropriate technique for VMMC using the ""Manual for Male Circumcision Under Local Anesthesia"" published by WHO, UNAIDS. Supervision and evaluation of trainees will be conducted following the protocol used during the parent RCT. Study subjects will be recruited in a variety of ways. In Santo Domingo, fliers will be posted in bars and night clubs frequented by men at high risk for HIV/STI acquisition. A group of volunteer commercial sex workers working on an HIV vaccine trial will be asked to refer their clients for the study. Men seeking care for STI at the clinic will also be invited to participate. In La Romana, men attending the Clínica de Familia will be invited to participate. In addition, a group of outreach workers will visit the ""bateyes"", the communities surrounding sugar cane fields where migrant laborers live, to educate men about MC and invite them to participate in the study. Men between 18-40 years will be provided with information about the study and will be invited to participate. If they express an interest in participating, informed consent will be obtained. The participant will go over the consent form with the counselor, who will assess his level of understanding and answer any questions. If there are no temporary or permanent excluding conditions, the participant will be asked to give informed consent for enrollment in the study. Men who elect to be circumcised will be fully informed about the benefits and risks of the procedure, as well as the surgical method to be used. After the informed consent is signed, a ""Locator Information Form"" containing confidential data such as subject's name and address will be completed. Only selected research staff will have access to this information, which will be filed separate from the rest of the study forms. A de-identified ""demographic information form and behavioral questionnaire"" will be completed next. Testing for HIV infection will be carried out using a rapid test. The test kits to be used are the synthetic peptide test, Determine HIV 1/2, and the recombinant antigen test Unigold HIV 1/2 Recombinant. Results are provided to the clients, with appropriate counseling, at the same visit. Participants are taught to observe, read and interpret the tests for themselves in the company of the counselor. Men with positive results will be informed of their HIV status and will be followed-up at the study clinic and referred for a confirmatory HIV-ELISA and, if confirmed, for HIV treatment. Serologic testing for HSV-2, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV), and hepatitis C antibody (HCV) will be performed using an ELISA test. A serum Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR) will be performed to test for syphilis. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing will be performed in urine using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. All participants who test positive for Chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea will be offered treatment free of charge. Participants who test positive for HSV-2 and have active genital lesions will be offered treatment free of charge. Those who test positive but have no active lesions will be counseled on safe sex practices and the risk of transmission to their partners as there is no recommended treatment for asymptomatic individuals infected with HSV-2. HIV, HBV, and HCV positive participants will be referred for evaluation and treatment at Clinica de la Familia in La Romana as these are chronic diseases that require long term treatment usually covered under government programs. If a participant is found to have a treatable STD and he does not return to the site, he will be called by the study investigators using the phone number provided by the participant at enrolment to ensure treatment is provided. If there is a temporary, medically curable condition present, such that it would be advisable to defer potential surgery, then the participant will be treated and asked to return for re-evaluation for study eligibility when he is cured. Men found to have an STD or to be HIV-positive will be referred for immediate care. Once enrollment is completed, participants will be given an appointment for the surgery. Circumcision will be performed soon after informed consent, preferably within a few days. All surgeries will be done under local anesthesia in a clinic by trained clinicians, using the standardized forceps-guided method described by Krieger and colleagues and contained in the WHO MC manual(23). Circumcised men will be counseled to refrain from sex for six weeks post-surgery and counseled about risk of HIV infection through open wounds during the healing process. They will be checked for complications and asked about their sexual activity seven days after the procedure. Men without complications will be followed six months after surgery with behavioral risk assessment, HIV testing and counseling. Men may come to the study sites for unscheduled visits at any time during the 6 month follow-up. All men will be counseled at enrollment and all follow-up visits to reduce their risk for HIV infection by consistent condom use and, where applicable, reductions in numbers of sex partners. Counselling on condom use and sexual risk reduction will be provided by trained, experienced, native-speaking counsellors. MC services will be offered at the selected two sites for 1 year. The estimated cost per circumcision is $40. We expect to recruit five clients per week at each site for a total convenience sample of 575 subjects in one year. During the second year of the project, we will continue to assess behavioral risk factors for the first six months and work on analyzing the data during the last semester of the project. Circumcision Procedure Prior to surgery, the clinician will obtain a complete medical history and perform a physical exam. A brief description of the procedure follows. The patient lies on his back in a comfortable position. The pubic area is shaved clean with a disposable razor and the hair is picked up with a dressing tape. The surgeon scrubs up and puts on 2 pairs of sterile gloves. The client's skin is prepared with Betadine solution, making sure that the inner surface of the prepuce and the glans are clean and the skin is dry. The outer pair of gloves is then removed. The client is draped with two drapes and a center ""O"" towel, and then, using 2% lidocaine without epinephrine, a dorsal nerve block and a field block with special attention to the ventral nerve, is performed. Normally, no more than 10ml of 2% lidocaine will be used. The anesthetic effect of the nerve block is checked, and revised if necessary. The prepuce is held with two mosquito forceps, one on each lateral aspect, then a curved mark is made with sterile disposable marking pens, outlining the planned surgical cut. The mark is made one cm proximal to the coronal sulcus all round, and parallel to the coronal sulcus. The prepuce is clamped along the mark with a Kocher clamp while retracting the glans, ensuring that the glans itself is not clamped. The prepuce is excised using a surgical blade along the mark. Bleeders are identified, clamped and tied. They are sutured, and if necessary ligated, using 3/0 plain catgut. After ligating all the bleeders, the area is irrigated with normal saline and then inspected for more bleeders, which are identified and tied. Using 3/0 chromic catgut on a taper 4/8 circle needle, a U-shaped horizontal mattress stitch is made on the ventral side of the penis (frenulum) to join the skin at the ""V"" shaped cut, which is then tied and tagged with a mosquito forceps. Using vertical mattress stitches, four quarters are tagged, and a vertical mattress stitch added, after which a simple stitch is put at the center of every two mattress stitches (a total of at least 16 stitches). The area is irrigated with normal saline and other simple stitches added as required. The wound is dressed with Sofratulle, then with a regular dressing bandage and a strapping. The client is advised to rest for 30 minutes, and if stable, discharged home on mild analgesics. Upon completion of the procedure the surgeon completes a procedure form. The excised foreskin tissue is taken to the laboratory with no identifiers, discarded with other laboratory waste, and incinerated with other biological waste within three days. Participants will be given verbal and written instructions on postoperative wound care and counseled to refrain from sexual activity for at least six weeks after the procedure. They will also be encouraged to come to the clinic or contact a clinician at any time with medical problems. Day 7 Post Circumcision Visit: Circumcised men will be asked to return to the clinic 7 days after the procedure to check the wound, to see if it is healing properly, to check for complications, and to ask about their sexual activity, their level of pain, resumption of work or other activities, and their satisfaction with the procedure and care at the clinic. As with all visits, any adverse events will be recorded. Blood and urine will be collected for STD testing at this visit. Six month post operative visit: During this visit a brief exam to confirmed proper wound healing will be performed. A behavioral and satisfaction questionnaire will be administered. Unscheduled Follow-up Visits: Ad hoc clinic visits will be encouraged to check and treat for complications of the procedure. At such visits, medical examinations and laboratory testing will be conducted as indicated, and appropriate treatment provided free of charge. Medical referral will be made if required. d.2. Data analysis Each enrolled participant will be assigned a confidential code, which will be used in all study forms. Only the principal investigators and research assistants will have access to the ""locator information form"" containing personal information. This form, which links the subject's confidential code to his name, will be stored in separate locked filing cabinets at the local principal investigator's offices. The locator information forms, which contain the personal information on the subjects, will be kept for 1.5 years in case we need to contact one of the subjects for an unexpected occurrence or with a question. After the end of that period, these locator forms will be destroyed at the research offices at the respective study sites using a micro cut shredder. Data will be coded and entered into computer datasets by trained personnel. Data extracted from questionnaires will be tabulated and analyzed using SAS statistical software version 9.1. and will be analyzed at the University of Illinois, College of Medicine, in Chicago by the principal investigator A questionnaire asking specific demographic information will be administered. The following variables will be recorded: age, religion, place of residence (urban/rural), education level, occupation and marital status. Simple descriptive statistics will be calculated and the effect of these variables on the willingness, uptake and rate of adverse events of VMMC will be estimated. In addition, we plan to estimate the effect of demographic characteristics on sexual behavior and disinhibition after the procedure. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Uncircumcised men; 2. Aged 18-40 years Exclusion Criteria: 1. Foreskin covering less than half of the glans; 2. Bleeding disorders; 3. Keloid formation; 4. Other conditions that might unduly increase the risks of elective surgery."

This study will explore the clinical impact of a customized cognitive stimulation program, using Musiquence.","Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive and irreversible deterioration of cognitive functioning that impairs behavioral and functional domains. Within non-pharmacological approaches, Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the most studied and well-established intervention for individuals with mild to moderate dementia. The underlying assumptions behind cognitive-based interventions of CST are:

1. IwD can benefit from cognitive stimulation if mobilized relatively preserved cognitive functions (e.g., crystallized abilities such as semantic memory and verbal skills), and;
2. Even in advanced age, exposure to enriched environments (i.e., socially and cognitively challenging) can enhance cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity.

Concerning the first assumption of cognitive-based interventions (a1), it is known that even in moderate to advanced stages of dementia, musical memory is one of the abilities that remain intact. It is hypothesized that music processing abilities precede the development of lexical language functions. This hypothesis is corroborated by findings that demonstrate that IwD are still responsive to music even when unable to communicate verbally or recognize words. Additionally, music is frequently associated with life experiences. Also, literature has reported that memories associated with specific music would be recollected longer than memories with no association to music; this suggests that using music as a reminiscence element on cognitive stimulation programs can have a promising effect on cognition. According to the second assumption of CST (a2), facilitating an enriching environment for IwD using, for , music and reminiscence elements could impact cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity.

In this context, Ferreira et al. developed a platform - Musiquence - that incorporates music and reminiscence in cognitive stimulation activities for IwD. Musiquence allows the gamification and personalization of 6 types of activities:

* Reality Orientation - a quiz-like activity that includes date and time information.
* Creative Drawings - a puzzle-like game in which the participant draws the missing pieces.
* Activities of Daily Living (ADL) - a puzzle-like game in which the participants have to perform a set of chores (i.e., brush the teeth), and the missing pieces are completed with real physical objects (i.e., toothpaste).
* Search Objects activity - exploration game in which the participants must find hidden images (e.g., cats) that are only visible through a virtual magnifying glass.
* Knowledge Quiz - participants must select the correct answer to a question among incorrect ones.
* Association activity - participants must categorize the items according to the instructions. For example, separate cars from motorcycles and locate them in the correct container.

The platform is compatible with different technologies that allow adaptation to the patients' needs (motor difficulties, vision problems, tremble). Cognitive stimulation content can be personalized to the user since the caregivers can add text, images, and music when creating the tasks.","Inclusion Criteria:

As fewer than 20% of patients survive to discharge, early prognostication of functional outcome needs accurate prediction.Survivors outcome depends on initial CA conditions (cause, duration and severity of ischemic injury) that may lead to the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, associated with high mortality. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is the second cause of poor outcome after CA. Indeed, most survivors remain comatose or in a vegetative state leading to decisions to withdraw life support. Thus, the American Academy of Neurology had proposed a decision algorithm for use in prognostication of comatose survivors published in 2006.Before the widespread use of therapeutic hypothermia (TH), predictor factors of neurological outcome were: serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), N20 somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP), status epilepticus, pupil and corneal reflexes and Glasgow coma score motor response (GCS-M).

Karolinska Institutet,OTHER,NCT02889484,Outcome of Surgery for Sciatica - a Comparison of Data From Three National Quality Registries,Outcome of Surgery for Sciatica - a Comparison of Data From Three National Quality Registries,"Purpose: The incidence of surgery for lumbar disc hernia varies. According to the national spine registries in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, there is a 30-60% difference in surgical incidence between these countries. The cause for this difference is not known. It may reflect a difference in incidence of lumbar disc hernia, but with a similar socio-economic and ethnical background in these countries, it is more likely that the differences are due to varying surgical indications. Comparing indications for surgery, patient reported outcome and factors predictive for outcome after surgery for lumbar disc hernia in these countries could provide information about optimal indications for surgery.

Hypotheses: (i) there are no differences in patient-reported outcome after surgery between these countries, (ii) there are no differences in indications for surgery between these countries and (iii), factors that predict outcome are similar in these countries.

Method of research: By using data from three Nordic national spine registers, we will compare baseline data, indications for surgery and patient reported outcome one year after surgery for lumbar disc herniation. Register based studies have advantages such as large sample sizes, reflecting real life, but they also have limitations such as lower follow-up rates than clinical trials. A non-response analysis will be performed to take this into account.","This is an observational register based study, with prospective data registration and a retrospective study design. Included are individuals treated surgically for a lumbar disc herniation between the ages of 18 through 65 years, without a history of previous lumbar spine surgery. Surgery has been performed in Denmark, Norway or Sweden during 2011, 2012 or 2013. Data will be presented according to the STROBE criteria.

The registers

All registries have the aim of studying outcome after spine surgery. All departments and patients participate voluntarily. At the time of admission, the patient reports data consisting of information on social factors, comorbidity and previous surgery. After surgery, the surgeon records diagnosis and type of surgery performed.

The Swespine Register has included individuals treated with surgery for lumbar disc herniation since 1993. During the last decade, the number of departments participating in the registry has varied between 35 and 41 of the 42 to 45 departments providing spinal surgery services in Sweden. Coverage is approximately 90%. The completeness (number of patients reported to Swespine at the time of surgery) is approximately 80%.

The Norwegian Spine register, NORspine, is based on experiences from the Swespine register and previous validation studies from a local clinical registry, and was founded in 2007. In total 36 of 40 centers performing lumbar spine surgery in Norway report to NORspine. Coverage is approximately 90%. The completeness is approximately 65%.

The Danish spine register, DaneSpine, is based on Swespine and was acquired by the Danish Spine Society from the Swedish Society of Spinal Surgeons in 2009 and has successively been implemented. In total 17 of 19 centers performing lumbar spine surgery in Denmark report to DaneSpine. Coverage is approximately 90%. The completeness is approximately 60%.

Quality assurance

As for all studies, there is a risk that loss to follow-up may bias the results. Solberg et al. (2011) studied 633 patients, who were operated on for degenerative disorders of the lumbar spine in Norway, and found that a loss to follow-up of 22% would not bias conclusions about overall treatment effects. There were no indications of worse outcomes in the non-responders group. In a similar one-center study of the DaneSpine. Højmark et al. (2016) found that a loss to follow-up of 12% at did not seem to bias the conclusions that can be drawn from DaneSpine at that center. Preliminary data indicates that predictors of outcome after lumbar disc herniation surgery are comparable with data in a study with a very high follow-up rate and with the Swespine register.

Data handling

Anonymized individual level data from all three registers will be pooled in one database. The cohort will be divided by country for comparisons.

Missing data and out of range data

In case of missing data case exclusion analysis by analysis, will be used. Out of range data will be deleted.

Analysis

The data will be cleaned by excluding patients with missing or incorrect date of surgery, missing date for follow-up, previous lumbar spine surgery and surgery other than discectomy only.

After data cleaning, we aim to perform blinded statistical analyses, in which the independent statistician performing the analyses is unaware of group belonging (i.e. country). The code will not be broken until the analyses and interpretations have been performed.

Comparisons of indications for surgery

Analysis of baseline data will include age at surgery, sex, anthropometrics, number of smokers, Oswestry Disability Index, numeric rating scale leg pain, numeric rating scale back pain, EQ-5D, number on sick leave, employment status, and duration of leg and back pain and presented as mean (SD), mean (95% confidence interval), or number (%).

Variables will be analyzed by analysis of variance, Chi-square or logistic regression tests. Data will be presented as crude (unadjusted) data to elucidate any differences between the countries.

Comparisons of outcome

Comparisons of the change of the outcome variables from baseline to 1 year, as well as comparisons of the actual value at 1 year will be performed. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), Chi-square or logistic regression tests will be used and the crude (unadjusted) data will be presented.

The baseline variables will be used as covariates in the ANCOVA and the adjusted data presented. Additionally, the results from the ANCOVA will be compared with results from propensity score matching or ANCOVA with the propensity score as a covariate.

Non-response analysis

A non-response analysis will be performed comparing all available baseline variables between those that responded to the 1 year follow-up with those that did not respond.

Sample size

A study of similar character has never been performed before. Due to the nature of the study, the sample size is not formulated in the guise of power, risk level, or clinical difference. The number of patients participating in the study is estimated to 7500. The sample is so large that differences in the Oswestry Disability Index of as low as 2 points may be detected (power 90%, significance level 5%), but in the interpretation the minimal important difference of 10-15 points in the Oswestry Disability Index often referred to has to be taken into account.","Inclusion Criteria:

According to the national spine registries in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, there is a 30-60% difference in surgical incidence between these countries. The cause for this difference is not known. It may reflect a difference in incidence of lumbar disc hernia, but with a similar socio-economic and ethnical background in these countries, it is more likely that the differences are due to varying surgical indications. Comparing indications for surgery, patient reported outcome and factors predictive for outcome after surgery for lumbar disc hernia in these countries could provide information about optimal indications for surgery. Hypotheses: (i) there are no differences in patient-reported outcome after surgery between these countries, (ii) there are no differences in indications for surgery between these countries and (iii), factors that predict outcome are similar in these countries. Method of research: By using data from three Nordic national spine registers, we will compare baseline data, indications for surgery and patient reported outcome one year after surgery for lumbar disc herniation. Register based studies have advantages such as large sample sizes, reflecting real life, but they also have limitations such as lower follow-up rates than clinical trials. A non-response analysis will be performed to take this into account. This is an observational register based study, with prospective data registration and a retrospective study design. Included are individuals treated surgically for a lumbar disc herniation between the ages of 18 through 65 years, without a history of previous lumbar spine surgery. Surgery has been performed in Denmark, Norway or Sweden during 2011, 2012 or 2013. Data will be presented according to the STROBE criteria. The registers All registries have the aim of studying outcome after spine surgery. All departments and patients participate voluntarily. At the time of admission, the patient reports data consisting of information on social factors, comorbidity and previous surgery. After surgery, the surgeon records diagnosis and type of surgery performed. The Swespine Register has included individuals treated with surgery for lumbar disc herniation since 1993. During the last decade, the number of departments participating in the registry has varied between 35 and 41 of the 42 to 45 departments providing spinal surgery services in Sweden.

This will be done using a stepped wedge design with 5 participating hospitals for a duration of 1.5 years. A comparison is made between an intervention phase (offering the online risk assessment questionnaire) and a control phase (hospital-based standard practice for the detection of CRC patients with hereditary or familial CRC, informed by the referral criteria that are being used in the intervention group). All patients with a diagnosis of CRC who have a first appointment at the CRC outpatient clinic will be included. The primary outcome is the percentage of all included patients who receive a recommendation for regular surveillance colonoscopies for himself/herself and/or relatives, provided by a clinical geneticist. Data from clinical geneticists is being used to answer this question.","Design: This is a multicenter prospective comparative cohort study, using a stepped-wedge design. All clusters (hospitals) start with the control strategy and switch, one by one, to the intervention strategy. Every 9 weeks a hospital will start implementing the questionnaire after a short training period of 1 week. As a referral to a clinical geneticist can take up to several months, we allow at least 6 months for the collection of the results of the genetic tests.

Control strategy: Each hospital starts with the control strategy. Just before the start of this study, all hospitals will be sent a list with the clinical genetics referral criteria that will be used for this study. Each hospital can decide on how to use these criteria.

Intervention strategy: Before the start of the study, all hospitals will be informed when the use of the online questionnaire will be implemented. They will also receive a manual on how to use the online CRF and questionnaire. The online CRF will be used to send out invitations for the questionnaire, to report baseline characteristics (age, sex, nationality, educational level, native language), reasons for non-participation, the number of changes that need to be made when verifying completed questionnaires and to calculate referral advice. In the training week, a researcher from the AMC will present the study to all involved persons and he will facilitate the implementation of the online CRF and questionnaire. All nurses and doctors participating in this study will be provided with their own login codes for the online CRF. Patients included in the training week will not be included in the analysis. All consecutive patients with CRC that have a first appointment at the outpatient clinic will be invited to complete the online questionnaire and they receive a record number. In case patients decline to complete the questionnaire, this will be reported by a nurse or gastroenterologist in the online CRF. If the patient consents, an email will be sent to the patient with a link to the questionnaire and the question to complete it before the next visit to the outpatient clinic. The online CRF will automatically result in a check for indications for referral to a clinical geneticist. The nurse or gastroenterologist can report this advice in the patient file and can decide on referring the patient.

Checking referrals to a clinical geneticist: Every two months, all patients included in the study will be tracked by searching for reports on clinical genetics consultation in their medical files and a check with local genetic centers will be done.

Statistical analysis of the primary outcome measure: The difference between the control group and intervention group in the proportion of patients who receive surveillance advice by a clinical geneticist will be calculated. A nonlinear mixed model will be used for testing the hypothesis of no difference. We will model the probability of receiving surveillance advice as a linear function, after a logit transformation, with as explanatory variables the hospital, the time interval, and the questionnaire effect: Logit(pijk)=μ+αi+βj+Χijθ, Where Logit(pijk) is the natural logarithm of the odds of a referral to a clinical geneticist for individuals (k) in cluster i at time j. μ is the overall mean, αi is a random effect for hospital i, βj is a fixed effect corresponding to time interval j, and Χij is an indicator variable for implementation of the questionnaire in hospital i at time j and θ is the questionnaire effect. Time effects will be analyzed in a discrete way (season, month) in case a primary effect is found. If no time effect is present, time function will be excluded from the model. For the primary outcome measures, we will use the intention-to-treat principle, including all eligible patients in the analysis.

Statistical analysis of the secondary outcome measures: for each secondary outcome measure, differences between the control and intervention group will be calculated using relative risks with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Secondary outcome measures to be calculated in the intervention group only, will be reported using descriptive statistics.

Sample size calculation: For the sample size calculation, a two-group chi-squared test of equal proportions was used as a starting point for comparing proportions in referrals in the control group versus the intervention group. Significance level was set at 5% (two sided) with a power of 80%. Of all CRC cases, approximately 20% are related to familial or hereditary factors. In the literature the reported proportion of CRC patients with an increased familial risk of CRC that is appropriately referred to a clinical geneticist ranges from 8% to 67%, with most studies reporting proportions between 10% and 30%. We estimate that 20% of patients at risk are referred, resulting in a referral rate of 4% of all CRC patients. We anticipate that the implementation of the questionnaire can increase this proportion up to 15%.To detect this difference we would need a sample size of 111 patients per treatment group. For the stepped wedge design the total sample size (111x2) needs to be multiplied by a design effect, that can be calculated using the following formula, where k is the number of steps, b is the number of baseline measurements, n is the number of patients per cluster, t is the number of measurements after each step and ρ is the intracluster correlation (ICC), which compares the within-group variance with the between-group variance:

DEsw= ((1+ρ(ktn+bn-1))/(1+ρ (0.5ktn+bn-1))) . ((3(1-ρ))/(2t(k-1/k)))

The ICC was estimated at 0.10 as no previously reported ICC for this topic was available.

As there are five participating hospitals, a total number of five steps (k) will be possible. As the study duration will be one year, each step will take 2 months. After randomization, each hospital starts with a training period of one week that will be added to these two months. We expect two to eight eligible patients per week per hospital, which results in 16 to 64 patients per hospital per step. With this information, a DEsw can be calculated. Assuming 16 patients per step, DEsw is 0.45. Assuming 64 patients per step, DEsw is 0.47. This corresponds with a required total sample size of 100 and 104 patients, respectively. When divided by the total number of patients per cluster, 6.2 and 1.6 clusters are needed for the minimum and maximum number of included patients respectively. We therefore believe that our number of five clusters would be sufficient.

Institutional review board: This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This IRB decided that the study did not meet the requirements of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). All local ethics committees confirmed the local practicability of this study.

Consent: According to the requirements of the AMC Research Code, digital approval will be asked from the patients for making use of personal data for this study in the intervention group. This means that questionnaires start with a question about the willingness to participate in this study. They can answer this question by indicating 'yes' or 'no'. If 'no' is answered, results will be removed from the database. Use of the digital questionnaire is considered safe as all answers are collected anonymously and could only be linked to a patient with a secured key document. This study will be carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. No approval for data use will be asked from patients in the control group, as this would increase awareness and would therefore bias results. Moreover, data from these patients will only be collected anonymously.

Monitoring and quality assurance: The AMC researcher will monitor all centers every month. Each site that is randomized will be visited for a training week.","Inclusion Criteria:

This will be done using a stepped wedge design with 5 participating hospitals for a duration of 1.5 years. A comparison is made between an intervention phase (offering the online risk assessment questionnaire) and a control phase (hospital-based standard practice for the detection of CRC patients with hereditary or familial CRC, informed by the referral criteria that are being used in the intervention group). All patients with a diagnosis of CRC who have a first appointment at the CRC outpatient clinic will be included. The primary outcome is the percentage of all included patients who receive a recommendation for regular surveillance colonoscopies for himself/herself and/or relatives, provided by a clinical geneticist. Data from clinical geneticists is being used to answer this question. Design: This is a multicenter prospective comparative cohort study, using a stepped-wedge design. All clusters (hospitals) start with the control strategy and switch, one by one, to the intervention strategy. Every 9 weeks a hospital will start implementing the questionnaire after a short training period of 1 week. As a referral to a clinical geneticist can take up to several months, we allow at least 6 months for the collection of the results of the genetic tests. Control strategy: Each hospital starts with the control strategy. Just before the start of this study, all hospitals will be sent a list with the clinical genetics referral criteria that will be used for this study. Each hospital can decide on how to use these criteria. Intervention strategy: Before the start of the study, all hospitals will be informed when the use of the online questionnaire will be implemented. They will also receive a manual on how to use the online CRF and questionnaire. The online CRF will be used to send out invitations for the questionnaire, to report baseline characteristics (age, sex, nationality, educational level, native language), reasons for non-participation, the number of changes that need to be made when verifying completed questionnaires and to calculate referral advice. In the training week, a researcher from the AMC will present the study to all involved persons and he will facilitate the implementation of the online CRF and questionnaire. All nurses and doctors participating in this study will be provided with their own login codes for the online CRF. Patients included in the training week will not be included in the analysis. All consecutive patients with CRC that have a first appointment at the outpatient clinic will be invited to complete the online questionnaire and they receive a record number. In case patients decline to complete the questionnaire, this will be reported by a nurse or gastroenterologist in the online CRF. If the patient consents, an email will be sent to the patient with a link to the questionnaire and the question to complete it before the next visit to the outpatient clinic. The online CRF will automatically result in a check for indications for referral to a clinical geneticist. The nurse or gastroenterologist can report this advice in the patient file and can decide on referring the patient. Checking referrals to a clinical geneticist: Every two months, all patients included in the study will be tracked by searching for reports on clinical genetics consultation in their medical files and a check with local genetic centers will be done. Statistical analysis of the primary outcome measure: The difference between the control group and intervention group in the proportion of patients who receive surveillance advice by a clinical geneticist will be calculated. A nonlinear mixed model will be used for testing the hypothesis of no difference. We will model the probability of receiving surveillance advice as a linear function, after a logit transformation, with as explanatory variables the hospital, the time interval, and the questionnaire effect: Logit(pijk)=μ+αi+βj+Χijθ, Where Logit(pijk) is the natural logarithm of the odds of a referral to a clinical geneticist for individuals (k) in cluster i at time j. μ is the overall mean, αi is a random effect for hospital i, βj is a fixed effect corresponding to time interval j, and Χij is an indicator variable for implementation of the questionnaire in hospital i at time j and θ is the questionnaire effect. Time effects will be analyzed in a discrete way (season, month) in case a primary effect is found. If no time effect is present, time function will be excluded from the model. For the primary outcome measures, we will use the intention-to-treat principle, including all eligible patients in the analysis. Statistical analysis of the secondary outcome measures: for each secondary outcome measure, differences between the control and intervention group will be calculated using relative risks with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Secondary outcome measures to be calculated in the intervention group only, will be reported using descriptive statistics. Sample size calculation: For the sample size calculation, a two-group chi-squared test of equal proportions was used as a starting point for comparing proportions in referrals in the control group versus the intervention group. Significance level was set at 5% (two sided) with a power of 80%. Of all CRC cases, approximately 20% are related to familial or hereditary factors. In the literature the reported proportion of CRC patients with an increased familial risk of CRC that is appropriately referred to a clinical geneticist ranges from 8% to 67%, with most studies reporting proportions between 10% and 30%. We estimate that 20% of patients at risk are referred, resulting in a referral rate of 4% of all CRC patients. We anticipate that the implementation of the questionnaire can increase this proportion up to 15%.To detect this difference we would need a sample size of 111 patients per treatment group. For the stepped wedge design the total sample size (111x2) needs to be multiplied by a design effect, that can be calculated using the following formula, where k is the number of steps, b is the number of baseline measurements, n is the number of patients per cluster, t is the number of measurements after each step and ρ is the intracluster correlation (ICC), which compares the within-group variance with the between-group variance: DEsw= ((1+ρ(ktn+bn-1))/(1+ρ (0.5ktn+bn-1))) . ((3(1-ρ))/(2t(k-1/k))) The ICC was estimated at 0.10 as no previously reported ICC for this topic was available. As there are five participating hospitals, a total number of five steps (k) will be possible. As the study duration will be one year, each step will take 2 months. After randomization, each hospital starts with a training period of one week that will be added to these two months. We expect two to eight eligible patients per week per hospital, which results in 16 to 64 patients per hospital per step. With this information, a DEsw can be calculated. Assuming 16 patients per step, DEsw is 0.45. Assuming 64 patients per step, DEsw is 0.47. This corresponds with a required total sample size of 100 and 104 patients, respectively. When divided by the total number of patients per cluster, 6.2 and 1.6 clusters are needed for the minimum and maximum number of included patients respectively. We therefore believe that our number of five clusters would be sufficient. Institutional review board: This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This IRB decided that the study did not meet the requirements of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO). All local ethics committees confirmed the local practicability of this study. Consent: According to the requirements of the AMC Research Code, digital approval will be asked from the patients for making use of personal data for this study in the intervention group. This means that questionnaires start with a question about the willingness to participate in this study. They can answer this question by indicating 'yes' or 'no'. If 'no' is answered, results will be removed from the database. Use of the digital questionnaire is considered safe as all answers are collected anonymously and could only be linked to a patient with a secured key document. This study will be carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. No approval for data use will be asked from patients in the control group, as this would increase awareness and would therefore bias results. Moreover, data from these patients will only be collected anonymously. Monitoring and quality assurance: The AMC researcher will monitor all centers every month. Each site that is randomized will be visited for a training week.

It is also increasingly found in the emergency services.However, emergency services are not designed to accommodate these patients, whose needs are specific. This population is defined by complex physical and psychosocial needs, included in a comprehensive geriatric assessment too complex to be carried out in the emergency services.

Many publications focused on ways to prevent potentially avoidable visits to geriatric patients in emergency services. People rely upon a therapeutic limitation code established for these patients to determine the intensity of the care that may be given to them. However, few geriatric patients arriving in the emergency services were already given such a code.

As a consequence, the intensity of the care given to these emergency patients is influenced by the perception of the functional and cognitive status of the patient, even if part of this perception is incorrect.

Aston University,OTHER,NCT02686879,Effect of Peripheral Defocus on Axial Growth in Hyperopes,The Effect of Peripheral Defocus on Axial Growth and Modulation of Refractive Error in Hyperopes,"Hyperopia, also known as farsightedness, is a common type of refractive error where distant objects may be seen more clearly than objects that are near.

Hyperopia is a known risk factor for amblyopia, (lazy eye), which may occur as a result of a squint (turn), or due to different levels of hyperopia between each eye (anisohyperopia).

Hyperopia and anisohyperopia often persist into adulthood resulting in impairment to binocular vision. Current management involves prescribing spectacles or contact lenses to correct the hyperopia in each eye, usually as a lifelong intervention.

In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in delaying progression of myopia (short-sightedness) by slowing down the growth of the eye using a particular type of contact lens termed a centre-distance multifocal design. There have been some encouraging results in this area to date.

The proposed study here would explore the use of centre-near multifocal design contact lenses to encourage growth of the eye, thereby reducing hyperopia. There are three elements to the programme of research:

1. The natural progression of axial growth and refractive error will be measured in hyperopic and anisohyperopic subjects aged between 5 and 19. In other words, the natural growth of the eye will be followed without any intervention
2. As a paired eye control study anisohyperopes aged between 8 and 15 will be fitted with a centre-near multifocal design contact lens in their more hyperopic eye and a single vision contact lens in the fellow eye, if required. The progression of axial growth and refractive error will be measured and compared in each eye
3. Subjects' aged between 8 and 15 with similar levels of hyperopia in each eye will be fitted with centre-near multifocal design contact lenses in each eye. The progression of axial growth and refractive error will be measured and compared to subjects in the natural progression study","Currently, hyperopia receives much less research attention than myopia even though the impact of moderate to high levels of hyperopia especially in one eye (anisohyperopia) can lead to amblyopia if not corrected fully at a young age. Hyperopia occurs as a consequence of insufficient ocular growth and a failure to emmetropise (reach the expected normal level) in childhood with the majority of hyperopic refractive errors resulting from an eye that is too short for its refractive power. In anisohyperopia it is unclear why one eye may remain hyperopic while the fellow eye grows towards an emmetropic state. Studies on animals have suggested that manipulating peripheral defocus through optical means while simultaneously providing correct axial focus can either discourage or encourage axial growth to effectively treat myopia or hyperopia respectively. Recent research has established that progression of myopia and axial growth can be significantly reduced in children and adolescents through the use of bifocal or multifocal contact lenses.

The optometrist has a central role in the clinical management of refractive error in children and in the application of future modalities that may modify the development of ametropia. The following proposal, therefore, presents a programme of work that is both relevant to the optometrist and novel in hyperopia research. By combining assessment of ocular biometry, monitoring of normal growth rates, an intervention study using bifocal contact lenses in children will be the first to provide new data on whether human eyes can be stimulated to grow in response to a specific type of defocus. Consequently the research will offer a new perspective on the management of hyperopia and anisohyperopia. The findings will offer a potential new approach towards amblyopia treatment in children and insight into a strategy for optimal correction to encourage axial growth in hyperopia.

There will be three elements to the proposed programme of research:

* Refractive error and axial growth will be followed over a three year period in hyperopic and anisohyperopic subjects aged between 5 and 19 years old to gain understanding of natural progression of these parameters in the specified cohort
* Simultaneous vision bifocal/mulitfocal soft contact lenses will be used to encourage axial growth in hyperopic children and adolescents with axial hyperopia in an effort to reduce hyperopia. The bifocal centre near design contact lenses will be prescribed to provide for clear central vision at both distance and near thus exposing the retina to peripheral hyperopic defocus from the distance zone
* This concept will also be applied to anisometropes as they represent a unique example of ocular development, where the two eyes of an individual, with an identical genetic background and seemingly subject to identical environmental influences, can grow asymmetrically to produce significantly different refractive errors. This correction and manipulation strategy has the potential to be applied to the more hyperopic eye to encourage eye growth and reduction of hyperopia with associated benefits of improved binocular vision and stereopsis.

For the natural progression study healthy hyperopic children and adolescents aged between 5 and 19 years of age will be recruited via the researcher's optometry practices and Aston University optometry clinic. The growth and visual characteristics of the eyes will be followed over time without any intervention by the research team. Following consent, at the initial visit, all participants will undergo a number of visual assessments including measurement of the axial length of the eye, focusing ability over a range of distances, eye muscle balance, vision at a range of different contrasts, pupil size and quality of stereovision and objective assessment of the crystalline lens parameters. Measures of the participant's spectacle prescription by objective and subjective means will also be undertaken following the instillation of eye drops to relax the muscles of the eye and to dilate the pupils. The eye drops will take around 40 minutes to work with the pupils returning to normal size after approximately 24 hours. The majority of these assessments are similar to those undertaken during a routine eye examination. The height of the subjects will also be taken at baseline and at six monthly intervals throughout the study. Parents and children will also be asked to complete a background questionnaire at this visit. The first visit is expected to last around 90 minutes. Participants will be reviewed every six months over a period of three years where the measures taken at baseline will be repeated. Instillation of eye drops to dilate the pupils and relax the eye muscles will be used on alternate visits.

For the intervention study, at the initial visit all participants will undergo a number of visual assessments including measurement of the shape and length of the eye, focusing ability over a range of distances, eye muscle balance, vision at a range of different contrasts, pupil size and quality of stereovision. Measures of the participant's spectacle prescription by objective and subjective means will also be undertaken following the instillation of eye drops to relax the muscles of the eye and to dilate the pupils. Subjects in the intervention groups will be reassessed after a period of six months to establish a measure of natural eye growth prior to being fitted with contact lenses. Parents and children will also be asked to complete a background questionnaire at this visit. The first visit is expected to last around 90 minutes.

The second visit for the intervention group will be to assess the individual's suitability for contact lens wear using a microscope. The participant and parent will be instructed on how to insert, remove and care for their contact lenses. The fitting of the contact lenses and level of vision will be assessed. For the anisohyperopes, the more hyperopic eye will be fitted with a commercially available soft multifocal contact lens and the less hyperopic eye will be fitted with a soft single vision contact lens. Subjects with similar levels of hyperopia in each eye will be fitted with commercially available soft multifocal contact lenses in both eyes. The participant will then be issued with a supply of contact lenses along with commercially produced instruction guides on caring for their contact lenses. The second visit is expected to last around 90 minutes.

The child may need to attend for unscheduled visits if any problems arise during the early stages of contact lens wear. Otherwise they will be reviewed at one to two weeks after the dispensing visit and also one month later for routine contact lens aftercare appointments.

Participants in the intervention groups will be reviewed at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the dispensing visit. During these visits the majority of measurements undertaken during the initial assessment will be repeated along with routine contact lens aftercare. Eye drops to relax the eye muscles and dilate the pupils will be instilled at the 12 and 24 month visits. For the anisohyperopic subjects, if the level of hyperopia in the more hyperopic eye reduces to a level that matches the less hyperopic eye then the intervention will be stopped. For the non-anisohyperopic subjects, the intervention will be stopped when the refractive error has reached a mean spherical error of +0.50D. At the end of an intervention period of 24 months the participants will be assessed after a period of 6 months to assess the growth of their eyes post-intervention.","Inclusion Criteria:

The study will also examine the impact on quality of life, medication adherence, medical costs, hospital readmission rates, and a variety of other important measures. The outcome of COSS may support a means to further enhance and develop a comprehensive care model program by leveraging the partnership between a health plan and a pharmacy benefit manager. The multidisciplinary team will provide face-to-face visits in a home setting with interventions that focus on five key areas: care transitions, self-management, care coordination, pharmacy and prevention, all designed to support high-risk Medicare members and their relationship with their primary care providers. If the study proves to reduce hospitalizations in the senior population, it could provide important guidance for future efforts to reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for seniors with chronic conditions.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Capecitabine may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Bevacizumab may make tumor cells more sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Giving chemotherapy and bevacizumab before and after radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine and bevacizumab together with radiation therapy followed by gemcitabine and bevacizumab works in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Compare 1-year overall survival of patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated with capecitabine, bevacizumab, and radiotherapy followed by maintenance therapy comprising gemcitabine and bevacizumab to a historical control.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the frequency of serious unacceptable adverse events in patients treated with this regimen.

II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Chemoradiotherapy and bevacizumab: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. Patients undergo reevaluation 3-4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and bevacizumab.

Patients with no evidence of disease progression proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients with a marked response may undergo surgery at the discretion of the attending surgeon and then proceed to maintenance therapy approximately 4-8 weeks later.

Maintenance therapy: Beginning within 4-7 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and bevacizumab, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 provided that blood counts have returned to normal.

Frailty increases the risk for adverse outcomes following transplant such as increased length of stay in the hospital, mortality, or graft function. No interventions for frailty are known for patients with renal disease, but exercise programs like pulmonary rehabilitation have been effective in improving frailty in patients with other diseases, such as lung disease. The goal of this study is to test whether exercise will also improve frailty among patients who are waiting for a kidney transplant and who are considered frail or pre-frail.","RECRUITMENT: This study will be conducted at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.

Most common protocols recommend heparin infusions after surgery with transition to oral aspirin when oral intake begins. Patients at risk for thrombosis after congenital heart surgery requiring long-term antiplatelet therapy include those undergoing shunt placement for single-ventricle palliation or establishment of pulmonary blood flow, valve replacements, or coronary artery manipulation. Post-operative thrombosis after congenital heart surgery is rare, but thrombosis can result in death. The routine use of aspirin in these patients is intended to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences of thrombosis. However, there is no routine clinical assessment of the platelet inhibitory effect of aspirin; nor have there been any prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of aspirin's antiplatelet effect in children after congenital heart surgery. No data exists to suggest that the first dose of aspirin transition from heparin infusion is either sufficient or insufficient in its antiplatelet effect.

In this study, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the first aspirin dose in its antiplatelet effects after surgery for congenital heart disease. Degree of antiplatelet effect will be evaluated with thromboelastograph (TEG) and TEG-platelet mapping study analysis. Thromboelastography is a clinical laboratory method of assessing whole blood hemostasis and allows for assessment of clot formation, strength, and stability. TEG is most commonly used in patients at risk for bleeding or thrombosis and also to monitor antiplatelet therapies (such as aspirin).

The investigators hypothesize: the first dose of aspirin transitioned from heparin infusion after congenital heart surgery is sufficient in its antiplatelet effect as tested by TEG and TEG-platelet mapping studies. Confirmation of the antiplatelet effect of aspirin will help support the current practice of empiric aspirin therapy to prevent post-operative thrombosis in children after congenital heart surgery.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

This disorder is different from schizophrenia. While some of the symptoms of the two disorders are similar, such as the tendency to have unusual beliefs and behaviors, people with schizotypal personality disorder do not experience hallucinations and are not significantly disconnected from reality, both of which are signature symptoms of schizophrenia. Guanfacine is a drug that is often used to treat high blood pressure and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. There is evidence that guanfacine enhances cognition and diminishes impulsivity. This study will determine the effectiveness of guanfacine in improving symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder.

Participants in this 6-week, double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either guanfacine or placebo. Participants receiving guanfacine will remain on the drug for the duration of the study. The other participants will receive placebo for the duration of the study. Guanfacine dosages will not exceed 2 mg per day. All participants will report to the study site weekly for assessments of vital signs, study compliance, medication side effects, and psychological symptoms.

Exclusion criteria: * for medical illness are identical to those of patients * must not meet criteria for a current or lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or any Axis II disorder. * a current Axis I or II diagnosis or a family history of psychotic disorder will also be excluded. However, to avoid a group of HC's too highly groomed and unrepresentative of the general population we will not exclude HC subjects meeting criteria for a past Axis I diagnosis, such as adjustment disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder not otherwise specified, specific phobia, and sleep disorders. In addition subjects meeting criteria for a non-IV substance abuse disorder more than 6 months prior to enrollment will not be excluded."

1. The primary aims of this study are to conduct formative interviews with teen mothers to inform a targeted adaptation of empirically based weight management and parent training programs for teen mothers for their preschoolers.
2. To conduct a small pilot and post-pilot focus group of the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment and retention methods \& the intervention.

Study Hypotheses:

Given the small sample size and fact that this is a pilot study, focus will be on estimating effect sizes rather than statistical hypothesis testing. However, the investigators exploratory hypotheses are as follows:

1. (a) The adapted intervention will be more feasible compared to the wellness control condition, with a participant retention rate of ≥80% and an average adherence (attendance at weekly treatment sessions; homework completion 5 weekdays weekly) is ≥ 75%; (b) The adapted intervention will be more acceptable compared to the wellness control condition, based on the Consumer Satisfaction Scale and Therapy Assessment Inventory with ≥90% of the participants responding to the item, ""In general how satisfied were you with the intervention?"" by choosing ""unsatisfied"" to ""very satisfied.""
2. (a) The adapted intervention will result in greater improvements in child behavior and parent-child connectedness compared to the control condition; (b) the adapted intervention versus wellness control condition will result in greater increases in child and teen mother individual as well as joint physical activity and physically active play and greater reductions in individual and joint teen mother and child sedentary behavior (television viewing) from baseline to post-intervention; (c) the greater teen mother and child fruit and vegetable consumption; and reduced child juice and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption from baseline to post-intervention; (d) the adapted intervention versus wellness control condition will result in smaller increases in child BMI percentile and teen mother BMI from baseline to post-intervention; (e) participants who attend higher numbers of intervention sessions will show greater improvements in target outcomes (child behavior, parent-child connectedness, and teen mother and child physical activity, sedentary behavior and BMI); with participants receiving the adapted intervention versus wellness control showing the greatest dose-based improvements.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

NHS Lothian,OTHER_GOV,NCT02438579,Hypertonic Saline Nasal Irrigation and Gargling for the Common Cold.,"Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS). A Pilot Randomised Control Trial of Hypertonic Saline Nasal Irrigation and Gargling on Individuals With the Common Cold to Assess Recruitment, Retention, Side Effects & Effectiveness","Viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), one of the commonest infection faced by humans, have a significant impact on individuals, families, health service and economy. Though rhinoviruses are called the ""common cold virus"", numerous viruses can cause URTI. Hence virus specific remedy for URTI is impractical. There are currently no evidence-based interventions that reduce the severity, symptom duration or viral shedding. Preliminary evidence suggests that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) may reduce the duration of symptoms.

With this pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), the investigators aim to assess the feasibility of undertaking a definitive RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI. This pilot focuses on recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely effect size of the intervention.

This pilot RCT compares HSNIG vs. usual care in 60 adults. Serial self-collected mid-turbinate swabs will help assess change in viral shedding. Symptomatic relief is measured by a validated symptom score. A questionnaire based participant feedback will help assess intervention and trial procedures.

This mixed-methods pilot trial will help inform plans for a definitive RCT of this low-cost intervention that has the potential of substantial health and societal benefits.","1. Aims:

   To assess the feasibility of undertaking a RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI focusing on recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely effect size of the intervention.

   1.1. Research questions:
   1. What is the likely rate of recruitment and loss to follow-up?
   2. Are the study procedures acceptable to participants?
   3. Is there a likely reduction in duration of symptoms and viral shedding?
   4. What effect size is estimated for the definitive trial in relation to duration of symptoms and improvement in quality-of-life?
2. Subjects:

   2.1 Sample size: This is a pilot trial so no formal sample size calculations are indicated. However, with a sample size of 27 per group the investigators would be able to express the proportion of those who return the symptom score diary and samples within that group to within ±19% based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval around an expected proportion of 0.5. With the two groups combined \[i.e. a sample size of 54\] the investigators would be able to express a proportion to within ±13%. To allow for 10% dropouts the sample size has been increased to 30 per group.

   2.2 Recruitment: The investigators propose to enrol a total of 60 participants (30/arm) for this pilot. The investigators plan to recruit by advertising the study in the community by the following routes.
   * Sending flyers to parents through schools run by Edinburgh and Midlothian councils.
   * Study website (www.elvisstudy.com), National Health Service (NHS) Lothian, University of Edinburgh websites.
   * Local media coverage by way of interviews.
   * Flyers in workplaces with large numbers of staff (e.g. banks, supermarkets, councils).
   * Posters in pharmacies and General practitioner (GP) surgeries.

   Interested individuals will be asked to contact the trial nurse at the clinical research facility (CRF) situated at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) and Western General Hospital within 48 hours of symptom onset. The trial nurse will consent, randomise, and recruit volunteers. Participants will be advised to go to their GP as per norm if they become unwell and that they can withdraw from the study if they so wish for other reasons. At the end of their participation in the study, they will be given £30 as recompense for any inconvenience.
3. Research Methods:

   3.1 Randomisation: Participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive intervention or control, this has been done using an online randomisation minimised by sex (M/F) and smoking status (current/not a current smoker) and allocated to each treatment arm with a probability 0.9 to ensure a random allocation.

   3.2 Instructions to participants: 3.2.1 Both arms: Participants are taught to complete (online or paper) a modified short Wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey (WURSS-21-Scot) and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Baseline symptom scores are recorded by the participant.

   Participants are taught to collect nasal swabs. A baseline swab is collected under observation and sent to the virology laboratory at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE). Swabs, transport medium and Royal Mail Safebox will be provided to the participant to collect a nasal swab first thing in the morning (before HSNIG for the intervention arm) for four consecutive days and return to the laboratory.

   3.2.2 Intervention arm: The intervention group will be shown a video on preparing the hypertonic sea-salt solution and how to perform HSNIG. They will be asked to perform the procedure under supervision. The trial nurse will help them identify the highest concentration of saline they are comfortable with. Participants are advised to perform the intervention as frequently as required (expected frequency around 6 times/day for the first two days, reducing in frequency from day 3 as symptoms improve). A package containing instructions, digital-measuring spoon, sea-salt, and equipment for irrigation and flask (if they wish to prepare solution for multiple uses during the day) will then be handed over to the participant. Participants in the intervention arm will also document compliance and side effects daily

   3.2.3 Control arm: They are advised to manage the URTI as they normally do.

   3.3 Data collection: 3.3.1 ""WURSS-21-Scot"" diary and EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire: All participants will complete the ""WURSS-21-Scot"" diary at a set time during the day. Participants will answer the question ""how unwell do you feel today"". If they score \>0, then symptoms and functional ability are graded 0-7. They then answer the global change question. Total score/day is calculated by summing the scores of all 10 symptoms daily. All participants will also answer the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.

   The following information is collected at recruitment: where they heard about the study, influenza vaccination history, number of family members and whether sufficient information was provided.

   The intervention arm will also answer the following questions daily: how many times they performed HSNIG, if they performed one or both parts of HSNIG and if there were any side effects.

   Both arms will answer if they had to take any medications for the URTI and whether they needed to contact the GP for further management of their URTI.

   Diaries are maintained until participant records ""not unwell"" on two consecutive days or for a maximum of 14 days or until follow up is terminated because the individual needs further treatment.

   3.3.2 Virology: Swabs will be sent to the Department of Virology, RIE for testing. Baseline samples will be tested to identify individuals in whom an aetiology can be proven. If a viral aetiology is identified, all samples (day 0 - day 4) will be tested in parallel to identify change in viral shedding.

   3.3.3 Data collection procedures: The trial nurse will follow up participants who do not complete the diary or return samples (after 48 hours of expected return). Information on number of family members with URTI will be collected at the end of the study. Feedback will be collected from participants after the follow-up period. These will address acceptability, health service use, costs to the patient and suggestions for improving the study procedures for the main trial.
4. Data Analysis:

The number of participants returning swabs, completing diaries and following treatment as per protocol will be presented as percentages (with 95% confidence intervals). The investigators will present recruitment as an overall rate, but also graphically as there is likely to be seasonal variation. Using results from the swabs the investigators will determine when a person stops viral shedding and, using chi-square and chi-square test for trend, determine if there is a relationship between groups. Using two-sample t-tests or non-parametric equivalent as appropriate the investigators will determine if there is any evidence of a difference in the duration of symptoms and symptom severity \[as defined by the maximum WURSS-21-Scot score over treatment period\]. Feedback will be analysed using a conventional content analysis approach, with emerging findings discussed by the research team to aid interpretation of findings.","Inclusion Criteria:

Participants will answer the question ""how unwell do you feel today"". If they score \>0, then symptoms and functional ability are graded 0-7. They then answer the global change question. Total score/day is calculated by summing the scores of all 10 symptoms daily. All participants will also answer the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. The following information is collected at recruitment: where they heard about the study, influenza vaccination history, number of family members and whether sufficient information was provided. The intervention arm will also answer the following questions daily: how many times they performed HSNIG, if they performed one or both parts of HSNIG and if there were any side effects. Both arms will answer if they had to take any medications for the URTI and whether they needed to contact the GP for further management of their URTI. Diaries are maintained until participant records ""not unwell"" on two consecutive days or for a maximum of 14 days or until follow up is terminated because the individual needs further treatment. 3.3.2 Virology: Swabs will be sent to the Department of Virology, RIE for testing. Baseline samples will be tested to identify individuals in whom an aetiology can be proven. If a viral aetiology is identified, all samples (day 0 - day 4) will be tested in parallel to identify change in viral shedding. 3.3.3 Data collection procedures: The trial nurse will follow up participants who do not complete the diary or return samples (after 48 hours of expected return). Information on number of family members with URTI will be collected at the end of the study. Feedback will be collected from participants after the follow-up period. These will address acceptability, health service use, costs to the patient and suggestions for improving the study procedures for the main trial. 4. Data Analysis: The number of participants returning swabs, completing diaries and following treatment as per protocol will be presented as percentages (with 95% confidence intervals). The investigators will present recruitment as an overall rate, but also graphically as there is likely to be seasonal variation. Using results from the swabs the investigators will determine when a person stops viral shedding and, using chi-square and chi-square test for trend, determine if there is a relationship between groups. Using two-sample t-tests or non-parametric equivalent as appropriate the investigators will determine if there is any evidence of a difference in the duration of symptoms and symptom severity \[as defined by the maximum WURSS-21-Scot score over treatment period\]. Feedback will be analysed using a conventional content analysis approach, with emerging findings discussed by the research team to aid interpretation of findings.

National Cancer Institute (NCI),NIH,NCT00047879,Phase II Trial of Peginterferon Alpha-2b and Thalidomide in Adults With Recurrent Gliomas,A Phase II Study of Peg-Interferon Alpha-2B (Peg-Intron(TM)) and Thalidomide in Adults With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas,"This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of peginterferon alpha-2b (PEG-Intron) alone and together with thalidomide in patients with gliomas (a type of brain tumor). Gliomas are nourished by blood delivered through blood vessels whose formation is stimulated by substances produced by the tumor itself. Stopping the growth of new vessels can slow or prevent tumor growth. The Food and Drug Administration has approved various interferons for treating several diseases, including melanoma and some leukemias. These drugs block new vessel growth in patients with recurrent tumors, but in high doses they produce serious side effects. Therefore, this study will use a low dose of PEG-Intron given weekly instead of high doses given several times a week. Thalidomide, currently approved to treat leprosy, also blocks development of new blood vessel formation. In a recent study of thalidomide given to 36 patients with gliomas, 4 patients had tumor shrinkage, 12 had stable disease for at least 2 months, and at least 3 had responses to treatment lasting 6 to 14 months.

Patients 18 years of age and older with a primary glioma whose tumor has recurred or is growing following standard treatment and does not respond to radiation therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination, blood and urine tests (including a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of the head.

Patients will continue treatment cycles as long as the drug is tolerated without serious side effects and the tumor is not growing. While on the study, patients will undergo various tests and procedures as follows:

Physical and neurologic examinations every 6 weeks MRI or CT brain scan every 6 weeks to assess tumor status. MRI is a diagnostic test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scan, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member through an intercom system at all times during the procedure.","Background:

There is a growing belief that angiogenesis inhibition represents a potentially promising, novel therapeutic approach to highly vascular solid tumors like malignant gliomas. Thalidomide and Peg-Intron (IFN - Interferon) are attractive drugs to use in combination to test the hypothesis of combination anti-angiogenesis therapy inhibition given their proven activity as single agents in patients with malignant gliomas and their spectrum of largely non-overlapping toxicities.

Given recent preclinical data describing more potent antiangiogenic and anti-tumor effects of low dose, continuous IFN administration, we are interested in evaluating the use of pegylated IFN in combination with thalidomide. Thus, we are proposing a phase II trial of pegylated IFN with thalidomide in patients with recurrent gliomas.

Objectives:

To obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy of PEG-Intron in combination with thalidomide in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas as assessed by prolongation of progression-free survival compared to historical controls.

A secondary endpoint in this trial is to determine the response rate associated with the combination therapy in each of the two strata and to evaluate and document all toxicities from PEG-Intron in combination with thalidomide at the doses prescribed in this protocol in this patient population.

Eligibility:

Patients with histologically proven supratentorial malignant primary gliomas will be eligible for this protocol. These include glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant astrocytoma NOS (not otherwise specified).

Patients must not have received prior therapy with Peg-Intron or Thalidomide.

Design:

Patients will be treated with weekly PEG-Intron plus daily oral thalidomide. All patients will be treated for 6 weeks following which patients will have a repeat MRI scan to assess disease response.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients must have evaluable or measurable disease and have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by MRI or CT scan. This scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dosage that has been stable for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and the initiation of treatment, a new 20 baseline MR/CT scan is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be used throughout the period of treatment for tumor measurement.
* Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible as long as the following conditions apply:
* They have recovered from the effects of surgery
* Measurable disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility into the study. Patients must have evaluable disease.
* To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a CT/MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or 4-6 weeks post-operatively. If the 96 hour scan is more than 2 weeks from registration, the scan needs to be repeated.
* The baseline on-study MR/CT is performed within 14 days of registration and on a steroid dosage that has been stable. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and the initiation of Peg-Intron with or without Thalidomide, a new baseline MR/CT is required on stable steroids for 5 days.
* Patient must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater than or equal to 4 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry.

These tests must be performed within 14 days prior to registration. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.
* Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible.
* This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to measure differences of intervention effects. Males and females will be recruited with no preference to gender. No exclusion to this study will be based on race. Minorities will actively be recruited to participate.
* Patients must not be pregnant or nursing, and all patients (both men and women) must be willing to practice birth control for 1 month prior, during and for 4 months after treatment with thalidomide.

Hadassah Medical Organization,OTHER,NCT03063684,Fractional / Pixel CO2 Laser Treatment of Vulvar Atrophy and Lichen Sclerosus,Fractional / Pixel CO2 Laser Treatment of Vulvar Atrophy and Lichen Sclerosus,"The study will examine the effects of fractional/pixel CO2 laser treatment in vaginal atrophy and in vulvar lichen sclerosus by means of histological and immuno-histochemical characterization of the epithelial layers and markers of tissue aging. The tissue characterization will be performed by biopsies of the vaginal or vulvar tissue at three different points of time: prior to treatment, two weeks after the third and last treatment, and one year after the last treatment.","Many studies have been published recently describing the use of a fractional/pixel CO2 laser for the treatment of various disorders of the vulva and the vagina, such as atrophy due to estrogen deficiency, urinary stress incontinence, skin diseases (lichen sclerosus) and more.

The results of the studies that investigated this technology in relation to vaginal atrophy and urinary stress incontinence have shown improvement in symptoms after a series of only 3 treatments.

The proposed effect of the fractional CO2 laser is based on studies performed on non-genital tissues \[Daffon, Capon\], which demonstrated changes in the connective tissue and proliferation of fibroblasts, as well as formation of collagen and elastic fibers. The suggested explanation is based on the theory that heat shock proteins are involved in the process and arise due to thermal tissue damage, and this in turn activate tissue cytokines, growth factors and fibroblasts. These theories have not been proven for vulvar and vaginal tissues, and except for the demonstration of histologic and morphologic changes in the irradiated tissues \[Salvatore, Menopause 2015\], the cellular mechanism of action and the nature of the process mediating the changes in uro-genital tissues has not yet been examined.

The technology known as fractional CO2 has been used for many years in dermatology and plastic surgery. In this method, the laser beam splits while passing through a lens to 81 dots (9 x 9 pixels) onto approximately 1 cm2. The laser beam penetrates the tissue and causes minimal evaporation around each spot of the fractionated beams and release of heat only at the desired tissue depth. The method of energy transfer to tissues in tiny dots leads to the creation of various thermal effects in the focus of the beam, around the focus, and in the areas between these heat foci. Following the tissue irradiation, different processes occur: epithelial cell proliferation and thickening of the epithelial layer, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, creation of neo-vasculature in the lamina propria, creation of collagen and elastic fibers, and accumulation of glycogen in the cells \[Salvatore, Menopause 2015\]. The result of these processes is improved tissue elasticity and plasticity as well as regeneration of the epidermis layer. Previous studies demonstrated that the effect of this treatment on the atrophic vagina is identical to long-term local estrogen treatment, with improved cytological index, improved lubrication, alteration of the vaginal flora, and reduced acidity to the level of ""estrogenic"" levels (approx. pH 4 -4.5) \[Salvatore, Menopause, 2015;Perino; Gasper; Salvatore, Climacteric, 2015\].

Considering the multitude of recently published articles presenting impressive clinical results, the investigators decided to examine the effects of the treatment with a fractional CO2 laser on the vaginal and vulvar tissue at a cellular level for two conditions: vaginal atrophy due to estrogen deficiency and lichen sclerosus. These two conditions were chosen due to the magnitude of recent publications dealing with clinical and histological improvement in these two pathological conditions following laser treatment. Understanding the cytological processes will enable the foundation of knowledge about the basic mechanism of action, and propose methods to improve the current therapeutic protocols. It will also enable the observation of the duration of the treatment effect, and the assessment of whether these changes are associated with undesired events, such as increased risk of malignant tissue transformation.

Patients The investigators intend to recruit 10 women for each group (10 women with atrophy and 10 with lichen sclerosus). Considering the availability of efficient and safe medical treatment, most women diagnosed with lichen sclerosus or vaginal atrophy are treated with medical preparations to their satisfaction. Therefore, the investigators will recruit the following types of patients for the trial: women with low compliance for the medical treatment, women who have developed intolerance to the treatment (such as chronic candida vulvovaginitis under long-term estrogen treatment, hypersensitivity reactions to the steroid ointment or estrogen preparation, or drug allergy) or women with only partial response to treatment, for whom there is no satisfactory therapeutic alternative.

The study includes 6 appointments:

T0-recruitment: ascertain eligibility, sign informed consent form, complete a questionnaire including epidemiologic and clinical details, gynecological examination, cytological smear (maturation index), determination of the acidity level of the vaginal secretions (pH), determination of vaginal health index score \[Bachmann\].

A punch biopsy will be taken from the mid-third of the vagina (in vaginal atrophy) or the vulva (in lichen sclerosus).

T1-Visit 2 (2-4 weeks from recruitment) The treatment protocol includes a series of three laser treatments, 4-6 weeks apart.

The first laser treatment will be performed during Visit 2. In the vagina, the treatment is performed by a special vaginal transducer enabling 360° treatment; the irradiation of the vagina is performed in adjacent ""squares"" along the entire vaginal circumference, by turning the handle while slowly withdrawing the transducer from the vaginal canal. The duration of treatment is 5-7 minutes. The vaginal treatment is not associated with pain. The treatment of the introitus will be performed by a transducer enabling treatment around 360° named FemiLift.

The treatment will be performed by a fractional micro-ablative CO2 laser system manufactured by Alma Laser in accordance with the accepted protocol (laser mode: pulse, energy: 40-80 mj/pulse).

For lichen sclerosus, a handgrip of the FemiLift transducer will be used, which transmits the ""pixel print"" directly and not under a 90° angle. Since the vulvar skin is pain sensitive, it will be treated prior to the laser application, with EMLA anesthetic cream. The duration of treatment is 3-7 minutes and it is performed by the same device with energy levels of 20-60 mj/pulse.

During Visit 3 (T2) and Visit 4 (T3), identical treatment to that described above will be performed.

In the framework of the study, the below follow-up procedures will be performed:

1. Biopsy - three biopsies will be taken from the lateral mid-third of the vagina: prior to treatment (T0), two weeks after the third and final treatment (T4) and one year after the completion of the treatment series (T5). The biopsy will be a punch biopsy with a 5 mm diameter. The biopsies will be performed under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine.
2. In the course of each of the follow-up examinations (T 0 - 5), the following will be performed (In vaginal atrophy):

   * Gynecological examination with speculum
   * Smear taken from the mid-third of the vagina with a cotton tip applicator, which will be used for a cytological smear and to determine the acidity level of the vaginal secretions.
   * The vaginal health index score will be determined, including the evaluation of 5 parameters: elasticity, pH, integrity of the epithelium, moisture and fluid volume. Each parameter is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, and if the total score is lower than 15, the vagina is considered atrophic \[Bachmann\].
   * The patient will be requested to grade symptoms (dryness, itching, burning, discomfort, dyspareunia, dysuria) on a VAS (visual analog scale) with ""very disturbing"" and ""not disturbing at all"" at its limits.
   * The patient will be requested to grade the extent of her satisfaction with the treatment results (very satisfied. satisfied, not sure, not satisfied, very unsatisfied).
   * The patient will be requested to report side effects.

In lichen sclerosus patients:

- External examination of the vulva and a photograph of the results for follow-up.

The biopsies will be sent to the Institute of Pathology at Hadassah Hospital, where the following examinations will be performed:

1. Routine hematoxylin-eosin staining.
2. Immunohistochemistry staining for P16 protein.
3. Immunohistochemistry staining for the KI-67 protein.
4. Immunohistochemistry staining for the p63 protein,\\.
5. Staining for alpha and beta estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors.","Vaginal Atrophy - Inclusion Criteria

These theories have not been proven for vulvar and vaginal tissues, and except for the demonstration of histologic and morphologic changes in the irradiated tissues \[Salvatore, Menopause 2015\], the cellular mechanism of action and the nature of the process mediating the changes in uro-genital tissues has not yet been examined. The technology known as fractional CO2 has been used for many years in dermatology and plastic surgery. In this method, the laser beam splits while passing through a lens to 81 dots (9 x 9 pixels) onto approximately 1 cm2. The laser beam penetrates the tissue and causes minimal evaporation around each spot of the fractionated beams and release of heat only at the desired tissue depth. The method of energy transfer to tissues in tiny dots leads to the creation of various thermal effects in the focus of the beam, around the focus, and in the areas between these heat foci. Following the tissue irradiation, different processes occur: epithelial cell proliferation and thickening of the epithelial layer, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, creation of neo-vasculature in the lamina propria, creation of collagen and elastic fibers, and accumulation of glycogen in the cells \[Salvatore, Menopause 2015\]. The result of these processes is improved tissue elasticity and plasticity as well as regeneration of the epidermis layer. Previous studies demonstrated that the effect of this treatment on the atrophic vagina is identical to long-term local estrogen treatment, with improved cytological index, improved lubrication, alteration of the vaginal flora, and reduced acidity to the level of ""estrogenic"" levels (approx. pH 4 -4.5) \[Salvatore, Menopause, 2015;Perino; Gasper; Salvatore, Climacteric, 2015\]. Considering the multitude of recently published articles presenting impressive clinical results, the investigators decided to examine the effects of the treatment with a fractional CO2 laser on the vaginal and vulvar tissue at a cellular level for two conditions: vaginal atrophy due to estrogen deficiency and lichen sclerosus. These two conditions were chosen due to the magnitude of recent publications dealing with clinical and histological improvement in these two pathological conditions following laser treatment. Understanding the cytological processes will enable the foundation of knowledge about the basic mechanism of action, and propose methods to improve the current therapeutic protocols. It will also enable the observation of the duration of the treatment effect, and the assessment of whether these changes are associated with undesired events, such as increased risk of malignant tissue transformation. Patients The investigators intend to recruit 10 women for each group (10 women with atrophy and 10 with lichen sclerosus). Considering the availability of efficient and safe medical treatment, most women diagnosed with lichen sclerosus or vaginal atrophy are treated with medical preparations to their satisfaction. Therefore, the investigators will recruit the following types of patients for the trial: women with low compliance for the medical treatment, women who have developed intolerance to the treatment (such as chronic candida vulvovaginitis under long-term estrogen treatment, hypersensitivity reactions to the steroid ointment or estrogen preparation, or drug allergy) or women with only partial response to treatment, for whom there is no satisfactory therapeutic alternative. The study includes 6 appointments: T0-recruitment: ascertain eligibility, sign informed consent form, complete a questionnaire including epidemiologic and clinical details, gynecological examination, cytological smear (maturation index), determination of the acidity level of the vaginal secretions (pH), determination of vaginal health index score \[Bachmann\]. A punch biopsy will be taken from the mid-third of the vagina (in vaginal atrophy) or the vulva (in lichen sclerosus). T1-Visit 2 (2-4 weeks from recruitment) The treatment protocol includes a series of three laser treatments, 4-6 weeks apart. The first laser treatment will be performed during Visit 2. In the vagina, the treatment is performed by a special vaginal transducer enabling 360° treatment; the irradiation of the vagina is performed in adjacent ""squares"" along the entire vaginal circumference, by turning the handle while slowly withdrawing the transducer from the vaginal canal. The duration of treatment is 5-7 minutes. The vaginal treatment is not associated with pain. The treatment of the introitus will be performed by a transducer enabling treatment around 360° named FemiLift. The treatment will be performed by a fractional micro-ablative CO2 laser system manufactured by Alma Laser in accordance with the accepted protocol (laser mode: pulse, energy: 40-80 mj/pulse). For lichen sclerosus, a handgrip of the FemiLift transducer will be used, which transmits the ""pixel print"" directly and not under a 90° angle. Since the vulvar skin is pain sensitive, it will be treated prior to the laser application, with EMLA anesthetic cream. The duration of treatment is 3-7 minutes and it is performed by the same device with energy levels of 20-60 mj/pulse. During Visit 3 (T2) and Visit 4 (T3), identical treatment to that described above will be performed. In the framework of the study, the below follow-up procedures will be performed: 1. Biopsy - three biopsies will be taken from the lateral mid-third of the vagina: prior to treatment (T0), two weeks after the third and final treatment (T4) and one year after the completion of the treatment series (T5). The biopsy will be a punch biopsy with a 5 mm diameter. The biopsies will be performed under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine. 2. In the course of each of the follow-up examinations (T 0 - 5), the following will be performed (In vaginal atrophy): * Gynecological examination with speculum * Smear taken from the mid-third of the vagina with a cotton tip applicator, which will be used for a cytological smear and to determine the acidity level of the vaginal secretions. * The vaginal health index score will be determined, including the evaluation of 5 parameters: elasticity, pH, integrity of the epithelium, moisture and fluid volume. Each parameter is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, and if the total score is lower than 15, the vagina is considered atrophic \[Bachmann\]. * The patient will be requested to grade symptoms (dryness, itching, burning, discomfort, dyspareunia, dysuria) on a VAS (visual analog scale) with ""very disturbing"" and ""not disturbing at all"" at its limits. * The patient will be requested to grade the extent of her satisfaction with the treatment results (very satisfied. satisfied, not sure, not satisfied, very unsatisfied). * The patient will be requested to report side effects. In lichen sclerosus patients: - External examination of the vulva and a photograph of the results for follow-up. The biopsies will be sent to the Institute of Pathology at Hadassah Hospital, where the following examinations will be performed: 1. Routine hematoxylin-eosin staining. 2. Immunohistochemistry staining for P16 protein. 3. Immunohistochemistry staining for the KI-67 protein. 4. Immunohistochemistry staining for the p63 protein,\\. 5. Staining for alpha and beta estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors.

The trial will include 150 patients with stable NSAIDs therapy, and at the first stage they will receive 24-week full-dose of Yisaipu®. Then at the second stage the patients who achieve low disease activity (LDA, ASDAS\<2.1) at 24th week will be randomizedly divided into three group: full-dose of Yisaipu® group, half-dose of Yisaipu® group and placebo group. And the blind stage will last for 48 weeks. Patients who complete the 72-week therapy or achieve disease-flare criteria during the blind stage would finish the study.","This randomised controlled trial enrolled adult patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis at 3 centres in China. Patients had to fulfil ASAS axial spondyloarthritis criteria but could not fulfil the modified New York radiologic criterion for ankylosing spondylitis,and had to have objective evidence of active inflammation or chronic structral change，such as bone erosion or fat metaplasia in the sacroiliac joints on MRI at screening. Active disease activity was defined as a disease activity score in ASDAS-CRP ≥2.1,or Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index \[BASDAI\] ≥4 on a numerical rating scale of 0-10, and an inadequate response to more than one non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 4 weeks at least, intolerance to NSAIDs, or contraindication for NSAIDs. No change in NSAIDs dose was required from 2 weeks before screening to the end of the study. Dose stability or discontinuation was required for 4 weeks before baseline for concomitant DMARDs or corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent at a dose of less than 10 mg/day). Chinese herbal medicine, physical therapy, or live (attenuated) vaccine, or intravenous immunoglobulin IgG, was required for discontinuation and wash period for at least 4 weeks. Patients were excluded if they had previously taken or were taking biologic treatment, any biologic Dmards such as IL-6 or CD-20 inhibitors. Patients with latent tuberculosis infection were included only when local guidelines were followed for prophylactic treatment and if treatment was initiated before Yisaipu.

All patients provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each study site. The study was conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and the Declaration of Helsinki.

A randomized envelope was used to enrol all patients at the baseline visit and to randomly assign qualifying patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either blinded Yisaipu 50 mg subcutaneously every week or 25 mg subcutaneously every week or matching placebo at week 24. All study personnel, including the sponsor (with the exception of the Sanshengguojian drug supply management team), investigator, and study site personnel, and the patient remained blinded to treatment throughout the double-blinded period from week 24 through week 72 of the study. Investigational products were provided to maintain blinding.

In the initial open-label period, enrolled patients were given subcutaneous injections of 50 mg Yisaipu every week for 36 weeks. Participants were given the dose of NSAIDs they had been receiving at screening; a dose decrease or discontinuation was allowed when the patients were intolerance to NSAIDs, or contraindication for NSAIDs. Patients who achieved clinical remission, defined as achieving ASDAS inactive or moderate disease (ASDAS score \<2.1) at weeks 24, were randomly assigned to receive either blinded 50mg Yisaipu (continuation arm), 25mg Yisaipu(reduction arm) or matching placebo (withdrawal arm) for 48 weeks during the double-blind period, for a total of 72 weeks of treatment.

2. To compare the outcomes of these two groups of subjects on measures of neurocognition, social cognition, motivation, and functional outcome.
3. To assess subjects six months after the intervention to determine the durability of training effects.
4. To identify changes in brain activation patterns in key neural regions as a result of TCT alone vs. TCT+SCT: during reward anticipation, and during emotion recognition.

The timeliness of this approach is supported by recent evidence demonstrating only weak associations between traditional cognitive remediation approaches and functional outcome in schizophrenia, but a strong, direct relationship between social cognition and functional outcome.

City of Hope Medical Center,OTHER,NCT00550784,"Combination Chemotherapy and Autologous Peripheral Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Stage III, Stage IV, or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancer, or Fallopian Tube Cancer",Phase I Trial of Tandem Chemotherapy Cycles as Consolidation Therapy for High-Risk Epithelial Ovarian and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Utilizing Intraperitoneal Paclitaxel/IV Cyclophosphamide Followed by IV Topotecan/Intraperitoneal Cisplatin/IV Melphalan Using Hematopoietic Stem Cell Support,"RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy before a peripheral stem cell transplant stops the growth of tumor cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, and certain chemotherapy drugs, helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. More chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of topotecan when given together with cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, melphalan, and cisplatin, followed by an autologous peripheral stem cell transplant in treating patients with stage III, stage IV, or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous infusion intravenous topotecan hydrochloride when administered with intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin and intravenous melphalan in patients with stage III, stage IV, or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.
* To describe the toxicities of each dose studied.
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of topotecan hydrochloride when administered at the maximum tolerated dose and cisplatin.
* To confirm the pharmacokinetic advantage of high-dose IP cisplatin and IP paclitaxel.
* To obtain tissue at the time of peritoneal catheter placement in order to evaluate the molecular determinants of apoptosis (including p53 status, p21 gene expression, bcl-2 gene expression, and bcl-2/bax ratio) and the extent of apoptosis by the TdT assay.
* To evaluate the molecular determinants of DNA damage and repair, including expression levels of ERCC1 and MDR1, and HER2/neu expression by immunohistochemistry.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of topotecan hydrochloride.

Patients undergo surgical placement of an intraperitoneal (IP) catheter. Tumor biopsies are obtained during surgery for laboratory analysis of molecular determinants of apoptosis (including p53 status, p21 gene expression, bcl-2 gene expression, bcl-2/bax ratio) and molecular determinants of DNA damage and repair (including expression levels of ERCC1 and MDR1, and HER2/neu expression by immunohistochemistry). The extent of apoptosis is also assessed using the TdT assay.

* Course 1: Patients receive paclitaxel IP on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV on day 2, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 3 and continuing until apheresis is completed. Patients undergo apheresis until ≥ 2.5 X 10\^6 CD34-positive cells/kg are collected. Two weeks later, patients proceed to course 2.
* Course 2: Patients receive cisplatin IP and melphalan IV on days -11 and -4 and topotecan hydrochloride by continuous infusion over 120 hours on days -10 to -6. Patients receive 25% of their peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) on day -3 and G-CSF IV beginning on day -3 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients receive their remaining PBSCs on day 0.

Patients undergo daily blood sample collection during topotecan hydrochloride administration for pharmacokinetic studies. Patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan hydrochloride undergo additional blood sample collections for pharmacokinetic studies.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.","DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

A recent systematic review suggests positive effects of music therapy (MT) on physiological measures of preterm infants and maternal anxiety, but methodologically rigorous studies including long-term follow-up of infant and parental outcomes are missing. Drawing upon caregivers' inherent resources, this study emphasizes caregiver involvement in MT to promote attuned, developmentally-appropriate musical interactions that may be of mutual benefit to infant and parent. This study will determine whether MT, as delivered by a qualified music therapist during neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization and/or in home/municipal settings following discharge, is superior to standard care in improving bonding between primary caregivers and preterm infants, parent well-being and infant development.

Methods: Design: International multi-center, assessor-blind, 2x2 factorial, pragmatic randomized controlled trial. A feasibility study has been completed; ethical approval for the main trial is pending. Participants: 250 preterm infants and their parents. Intervention: MT focusing on singing specifically tailored to infant responses, will be delivered during NICU and/or during a post-discharge 6-month period. Primary outcome: Changes in mother-infant bonding until 6 months corrected age (CA), as measured by the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes: Mother-infant bonding at discharge and over 12 months CA; child development over 24 months; and parental depression, anxiety, and stress, and infant re-hospitalization, all over 12 months.

Discussion: This study fills a gap by measuring the long-term impact of MT for preterm infants/caregivers, and of MT beyond the hospital context. Outcomes related to highly involving parents in MT will directly inform the development of clinical practice in Scandinavia and other contexts with similar social welfare practices. By incorporating family-centered care, continuity of care, user involvement, and cultural relevance, this study can potentially contribute to improved quality of care for premature infants and their parents worldwide.",,"Inclusion Criteria (infants):

This is a drug available for doctors to prescribe for patients with Friedrich's Ataxia. But, this drug has not yet been tested in women who have recently given birth and are breastfeeding or pumping milk for their babies. So, researchers do not know how much of the drug could be passed on to babies through the breastmilk of mothers who may take BIIB141.

The main objective of this study is to learn how a single dose of BIIB141 is processed in both the breastmilk and in the blood of healthy women who are breastfeeding.

The main question researchers want to answer in this study is:

* How does BIIB141 move from the blood into the breastmilk?

Researchers will also learn more about:

* How BIIB141 moves through the blood
* What dose of BIIB141 a baby may get from the mother's breastmilk
* Any medical problems the participants have during the study

This study will be done as follows:

* Participants will be screened to check if they can join the study. The screening period will be up to 28 days, after which participants will check into their study research center.
* Participants will take a single dose of BIIB141 as a tablet by mouth on Day 1.
* Participants will remain at their study research center for 6 days. During this time, the participants will be provided with an electric breast pump. This is so that the researchers can collect breastmilk samples before and after the participants take BIIB141. The researchers will also collect blood samples.
* After leaving the study research center, the participants will return every 2 days for the next 10 days for more tests and checkups.

Zagazig University,OTHER_GOV,NCT04874779,Acute Kidney Injury Risk in COVID-19,Risk of Acute Kidney Injury Among Patients Infected With COVID-19: A Retrospective Single Center Study,"Background. Within a year, COVID-19 has advanced from being an outbreak to a pandemic, spreading rapidly and globally with devastating impact. Currently, there is an ongoing debate among scientists about the pathophysiological relationship between COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI). While a few studies have concluded that the mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19 patients are seemingly multifactorial and have not been fully explicated, others asserted that AKI remains rare among COVID-19-related diseases. Considering this knowledge-gap and its potential impact on the management of COVID-19-associated AKI, our study aims to explore the prevalence of AKI and to identify possible risk factors associated with AKI development among COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Materials and Methods. This retrospective cohort study included 83 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at AL-AHRAR Hospital, Zagazig, Egypt, between June and August,2020. Exclusion criteria were: patients younger than 18 years of age; diagnosed with end stage kidney disease; placed on maintenance dialysis; booked for a kidney transplant or on nephrotoxic medications. All patients included in the study underwent complete blood count; liver and renal function tests; examination of hemostasis parameters; inflammatory markers; serum electrolytes; routine urinalysis; arterial blood gas and non-enhanced chest and abdominal computer tomography (CT) scans","2.1. Study design and participants. Retrospective observational single-center study, including (83) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (age ≥ 18 years), hospitalized and isolated in the medical departments of AL-AHRAR Hospital, Zagazig, Egypt, from June 23 to August 29, 2020. All patients were isolated in the medical departments. None of them were admitted to the ICU or underwent mechanical ventilation. According to the WHO guidelines, a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result of a quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection in a nasopharyngeal swab. (9) We excluded the following from this study: patients younger than 18 years, patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease before admission, patients on maintenance dialysis or awaiting renal transplantation and patients taking any nephrotoxic medications a week prior to admission.

2.2. Data collection. The patients' medical history, underlying diseases, medications administered at home and in hospital, laboratory data, non-enhanced chest and abdominal computer tomography (CT) scans, were retrieved from electronic medical records. According to the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), Egypt Management protocol for COVID-19 Patients, version 1.4, 30th May,2020, (10), all patients received standard of care treatment including: (a) oxygen supply to achieve SaO2 ≥ 90%; (b) Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice in first day then 200 mg twice for 6 days); (C) Vitamin C (1gm daily); (d) Zinc (50mg daily); (e) Acetylcysteine 200 mg t.d.s.; (f) lactoferrin one sachet twice daily; (g) Anticoagulation if D-dimer \> 1000.

2.3. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using Thermofisher SCIENTIFIC's TaqPathTM COVID 19 CE IVD RT PCR Kit, 1000 reactions (Cat. No. A48067). The QUIAGEN extraction kit was used to extract viral RNA. Using Quick Dx Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR instruments, the purified nucleic acid was reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified using the TaqPathTM COVID 19 RT PCR Kit in one stage. Probes annealed to three unique SARS-CoV-2 target sequences: ORF1ab, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) primers/probes for bacteriophage MS2. The result was deemed null because two of the three genes and the MS2 (positive control) were all positive. COVID-19 was diagnosed whenever a positive real-time RT-PCR result was identified.

2.4. Laboratory procedures. Laboratory data included complete blood count by automated blood counter, liver and renal function tests by colorimetric method, examination of hemostasis parameters, inflammatory markers, serum Na, Serum K, serum Ca, urine dipstick test and arterial blood gas analysis.

2.5. Definitions. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to the guidelines of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). It is defined as any of the following: (I) an S.cr increase ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 h; or (II) an S.cr increase to ≥1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days; or (III) a urine volume ≤0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 h. AKI is staged for severity according to the criteria presented in Table (1). (11) Urine output criteria were not used consistently for the diagnosis of AKI due to a lack of daily urine measurement in the electronic chart.

The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was developed as a morbidity severity score to focus on organ dysfunction, which can reliably predict disease severity and outcome. It includes 6 variables, each representing an organ system presented in Table (2). (12) Statistical Analyses. The SPSS software, version 26, was used for statistical analysis. ANOVA and univariate logistic regression analysis \[odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)\] were performed (significance level: P \< 0.05).

Ethics statement. In order to maintain and ascertain the rights of patients without jeopardizing their privacy and confidentiality, informed verbal consents, in lieu of written informed consents, were obtained directly from all patients or their relatives. The requirements to obtain written informed consents were not attainable due to the inherent hazardous and contagious nature of COVID-19 epidemic, the strict restrictions by the hospital management, and the urgency of collecting the data.","Inclusion Criteria:

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a life-threatening, genetic, and ultra-rare metabolic disease characterized by defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation that can lead to progressive damage to multiple vital organs, including destruction and deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and respiratory failure. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for patients with this disease. There is also limited data available on the natural course of this disease over time, particularly in patients with the juvenile-onset form.

Efficacy analyses were prospectively defined in the protocol with a comparison to historical controls. The historical control group came from patients whose characteristics matched as closely as possible the entry criteria for the trial. The control group included all patients who had x-rays within the age range defined by the inclusion criteria of this study (5 to 12 years of age, inclusive, with open growth plates).

The pre-specified plan for analysis was to combine the two asfotase alfa treated groups (asfotase alfa 2 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) injection three times per week or 3 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) injection three times per week) and compare them to historical controls.","Inclusion Criteria:

Asfotase Alfa was formerly referred to as ENB-0040 Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a life-threatening, genetic, and ultra-rare metabolic disease characterized by defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation that can lead to progressive damage to multiple vital organs, including destruction and deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and respiratory failure. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for patients with this disease. There is also limited data available on the natural course of this disease over time, particularly in patients with the juvenile-onset form. Efficacy analyses were prospectively defined in the protocol with a comparison to historical controls. The historical control group came from patients whose characteristics matched as closely as possible the entry criteria for the trial. The control group included all patients who had x-rays within the age range defined by the inclusion criteria of this study (5 to 12 years of age, inclusive, with open growth plates). The pre-specified plan for analysis was to combine the two asfotase alfa treated groups (asfotase alfa 2 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) injection three times per week or 3 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) injection three times per week) and compare them to historical controls.

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,OTHER,NCT02322879,Protective Effects of Propylene Glycol in Daily Acetaminophen Dosing,Protective Effects of Propylene Glycol in Daily Acetaminophen Dosing,A purpose of this protocol is to is to compare the metabolites of the toxic bioactivating pathway after acetaminophen alone or acetaminophen followed by Propylene Glycol (PG) and to determine if it prevents the formation of the toxic metabolites of acetaminophen.,"The purpose of this protocol is to contribute to our overarching purpose, which is to determine if inhibiting the bioactivation of acetaminophen (APAP) can prevent liver injury, and to further describe the initiating mechanisms of APAP induced liver injury. APAP induced liver injury is caused by metabolism and/or the resulting metabolites when APAP undergoes reductive metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, principally via CYP 2E1. Inhibition of CYP 2E1 activity protects against toxicity in rodents and tissue culture. Our prior research indicates that inhibition of CYP 2E1 by administering a pediatric preparation of APAP containing Propylene Glycol (PG), a known CYP 2E1 inhibitor, results in reduced production of CYP 2E1 derived metabolites via competitive inhibition.

In this proposed protocol the investigators will provide therapeutic doses of APAP and a separately administered non toxic dose of PG over a two-week period to healthy subjects. 20-75% of healthy people who take therapeutic doses of APAP for 7-28 days will have an asymptomatic and subclinical rise in transaminase levels that will return to baseline without adverse effect or therapy. 3 The return to baseline occurs despite continued dosing of APAP.

A primary purpose is to determine if PG is, in fact, the substance in the liquid preparation responsible for the effect the investigators observed in the investigators initial study. A secondary purpose is to obtain plasma samples for secondary metabolomic analysis to elucidate the effect of CYP 2E1 inhibition.

Specific Aims

* 1 To demonstrate that co-administration of PG with APAP prevents the rise in AST/ALT expected in approximately one third of subjects following therapeutic dosing of APAP over days.
* 2 To show that PG administered with APAP reduces toxic P450-derived metabolite production following therapeutic APAP administration.
* 3 To obtain plasma samples to undergo metabolomic and other analyses to determine the effects of CYP 2E1 inhibition in the setting of APAP administration.
* 4 To undergo metabolomic analyses on the day LFT's peak to determine differences in metabolomics parameters between subjects receiving propylene glycol plus acetaminophen versus just acetaminophen alone.","Inclusion Criteria:

Despite the efficacy of MMS, it is well known that treatment effects of health behaviors erode and that adherence to new health behaviors is often poor, with relapse rates up to 50% or more within 6 months, perhaps because the constructs responsible for behavior acquisition differ from those that sustain behavior change. This innovative behavior-maintenance intervention, Mujer Segura Siempre (MSS), will be delivered using text messaging. It incorporates concepts that are theorized to be important to sustain positive behavior change, and it builds on maintenance-specific content and skills that have been significant in interventions focused on other health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation, weight loss). All women enrolled in the study will begin by receiving the Mujer Más Segura (MMS) counseling, with specific information for women who are intravenous drug users (IDU) in addition to being FSWs. High levels of injection and non-injection drug use have been reported by FSWs and their male clients in our study sites, making it imperative to address safer injection practices in both the initial behavior change program and in our text-based maintenance program.

The text messages that constitute the experimental part of this study will be based on maintenance-specific behavioral and cognitive constructs that are theorized to be involved in behavior maintenance, including self-regulatory focus, maintenance self-efficacy, and relapse prevention planning. The MSS text messaging maintenance intervention will be compared to time-equivalent exposure to general health text messages. Our specific aims are:

Aim 1: Determine if the MSS intervention (MMS counseling plus 24 months of behavioral maintenance text messages-Group 1) is associated with significant reductions in HIV/STI incidence (primary outcome) relative to a time-equivalent control condition (counseling + 24 months of general health text messages-Group 2) among drug-using and non-drug-using FSWs in Tijuana and Cd. Juarez.

Aim 2: Determine if the MSS intervention is associated with increased use of condoms for vaginal and anal sex with male clients, better attendance at regularly scheduled STI screenings, and reduced sharing of injection equipment for FSW-IDU (secondary outcomes) relative to a time-equivalent control condition.

Aim 3: Determine if substance use factors (frequency, intensity, and patterns of alcohol and drug use, including injection use, binge use, polydrug use) mediate or moderate intervention efficacy, taking into account structural and environmental risk factors (e.g., availability of condoms, drugs in the workplace), maintenance constructs (e.g., relapse prevention planning, self-efficacy maintenance), and personal characteristics (e.g., age, sexual abuse, depression).

Aim 4: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MSS compared to the control condition, Mujer Más Segura alone (based on data from previous studies), and usual care in Mexico.

To accomplish these aims, investigators will deliver MSS to 600 HIV-negative FSWs (300 in Tijuana, 300 in Cd. Juarez) who report unsafe sex with at least one client in the previous 6 months, and randomize them to either one of two groups: Group 1 (n=300), MSS text-based maintenance program for 24 months post-counseling; or Group 2 (control condition, n=300) general health text messages for 24 months post counseling.

Investigators prospectively enrolled 47 patients with LPN between June 2020 and February 2021. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: the control group (24 patients), who underwent operation with an intraoperative ultrasound (US) control and the experimental group (23 patients), who underwent operation with the aid of the MR model. Randomization was performed using a computerized randomization program and sealed envelopes. Patients were included in the study if they were 18 years of age or older, were able to sign informed consent, and had T1a renal tumors amenable to LPN. Patients were excluded if they were unwilling to participate or did not meet the inclusion criteria. For each patient, investigators prospectively collected demographic data including age, body mass index, clinical tumor size, side, location, and complexity score according to the PADUA scoring system; perioperative data (including time for renal pedicle exposure and time for renal tumor detection and duration of ischemia); pathological data; data on postoperative functional outcome and complications, classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Vanderbilt University,OTHER,NCT00653484,Energy Balance Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Prevention,Energy Balance Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Prevention,"RATIONALE: Calories and physical exercise may affect the risk of developing cancer. It is not yet known whether a low-calorie diet and/or physical activity program is effective in preventing cancer in participants at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying diet and physical activity in healthy overweight, obese, or inactive participants at risk of developing colorectal cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* To compare four 12-week energy-balance interventions comprising a physical activity intervention (+2,000 kcal/wk), a dietary energy restriction intervention (DER)(-2,000 kcal/wk), or a combined physical activity and DER intervention (+1,000/-1,000 kcal/wk) vs no intervention in healthy, overweight, or moderately obese participants at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer.
* To quantify changes in circulating biomarkers (e.g., insulin, IGF-1, leptin, c-reactive protein, or isoprostanes) proposed to mediate the anticarcinogenic effects of DER in these participants.

OUTLINE: This study consists of a 2-week run-in period (baseline) followed by a 12-week intervention period.

Participants undergo three study visits at Vanderbilt University General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). Beginning at study visit 1, participants undergo a 2-week run-in period to obtain baseline measures of body composition (via dual x-ray absorptiometry), cardiorespiratory fitness (via treadmill testing), physical activity, dietary intake, energy expenditure, and metabolic activity. Dietary assessments using 24-hour dietary recalls are conducted by the GCRC dietitian during the run-in period. GCRC dietitians complete three 24-hour recalls on randomly selected days during the 2-week assessment period to provide an estimate of the participant's habitual food intake at baseline. Baseline energy needs are assessed during activity monitored run-in period to obtain measures of the participant's resting energy expenditure and total daily energy expenditure. Participants are also assessed using a brief psychological profile that is used to individualize the study intervention for each participant.

Approximately 10-14 days after the initial visit and after all baseline assessments have been completed, participants undergo a second study visit. Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms.

* Arm I (physical activity): Participants undergo an in-person, 30- to 60-minute counseling visit, followed by five brief 10- to 15-minute telephone-counseling calls over 12 weeks. During the initial counseling session, participants learn about goal setting and how to develop a personalized plan for meeting their intervention goals. Participants are instructed about wearing proper shoes and about monitoring their exercise duration and intensity. Participants are also given pedometers to help track their activity patterns and to monitor their progress in meeting program objectives. Participants must wear the pedometers for 7 days at baseline and again at 12 weeks. The information provided is used to estimate overall physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), steps per day, and time spent in different levels of activity.

Participants are monitored periodically for adherence to the exercise program through behavioral counseling and self-reported logs of daily exercise and pedometer steps. Dietary intake is measured periodically using multiple 24-hour dietary recalls to carefully assess possible changes in energy intake and dietary quality over the course of the study.

* Arm II (dietary energy restriction \[DER\]): Based on the initial estimate of energy needs determined during the run-in period, participants receive a reduced-calorie, food exchange-based diet for 12 weeks. Each diet is individualized to achieve the desired daily energy deficit of 300 calories per day based on physical activity levels. All meals are prepared by the GCRC metabolic kitchen. Participants receive one multivitamin per day and no other nutritional supplements. Fluids including coffee, water, and other drinks are allowed at the pre-study level. Each week, participants meet with the dietitian to discuss the participant's progress, submit daily reports of food intake, return uneaten food items, and to provide urine samples for assessment of urinary biomarkers.

Adherence to the diet is monitored by compliance with food pick-up, dietary records, and measures of urinary metabolites. Participants are also provided with individual instruction, counseling, and assessment by the study dietitian.

* Arm III (physical activity and DER): Participants undergo a 12-week DER and physical-activity program, as described in arms I and II, with the exception that the dose of PAEE and DER in the combined intervention (i.e., +1,000/-1,000 kcal/week) is half that of each individual intervention (+2,000 kcal/week for arm I and -2,000 kcal/week for arm II). Participants in arm III receive an individualized reduced-calorie diet designed to achieve a desired daily energy deficit of 150 calories per day based on participant physical activity levels.
* Arm IV (wait-list control): Participants are followed periodically. At study visit 3, after completion of the 12-week study interventions, participants undergo repeat assessment of body composition, fitness, diet, and activity measures.

Participants undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and at 12 weeks for correlative laboratory studies. Blood samples are assessed for circulating biomarkers that are involved in energy homeostasis and metabolic control (e.g., insulin, IGF, and leptin) and inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., c-reactive protein, PGE-2, and isoprostanes). Urine samples are examined for biomarkers of dietary protein intake (i.e., nitrogen content), dietary sodium, and potassium intake.

Participants complete the Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline and at 12 weeks for assessment of PAEE through non-occupational activities, including social activities, recreation, hobbies, housework, walking, jogging, and 14 other types of exercise.","Inclusion Criteria:

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the infectious germ most commonly associated with lactation mastitis. Twenty percent of the general population are carriers of Staphylococcus aureus, which means that they carry the infectious germ but do not become ill from it. It has been suggested that mothers who are carriers of S. aureus in their nostril may be at an increased risk of developing lactational mastitis, however; this has not been clinical proven.

We are studying the relationship between S. aureus carrier status of breastfeeding mothers and infants and the risk of developing lactational mastitis. Additionally, we are collecting questionnaire data in an attempt to better define factors predisposing women to lactation mastitis.","Lactation mastitis is an acute inflammation of the interlobular connective tissue within the mammary gland of a breastfeeding woman. It is a relatively common condition that causes pain and worry, and can lead to restriction in activity and increased risk of early weaning from breastfeeding. Staphylococcus aureus is the infectious agent most commonly implicated in lactation mastitis.

It is well established that the anterior nares are the primary reservoir of S. aureus in humans and that approximately 20% of healthy individuals are ""persistent carriers"" of the organism. Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus has been identified as a significant risk factor for the development of infection including surgical wound infections. It has been suggested that maternal and infant nasal carriage of S. aureus may be associated with an increased risk of breast infection during lactation.

We propose to prospectively study the relationship between the S. aureus carrier status of 500 healthy breastfeeding dyads and the rate of the subsequent development of lactational mastitis. Carrier status of mothers and infants will be determined through two nasal swabbings performed in the early post-partum period.

"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",OTHER,NCT02428179,Impact of Structured Communication in the OR on Surgical Site Infections: Prospective Observational Clinical Trial,StOP?-Trial: Impact of Structured Communication in the OR on Surgical Site Infections: Prospective Observational Clinical Trial,"Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most frequent complication in patients that undergo abdominal surgery. A previous prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing elective open abdominal procedures showed that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI whereas case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for incisional SSI. Therefore, the introduction of a clinical applicable intervention ""structured briefing using the StOP protocol"" has been developed and was tested in pilot experiments. This intervention aims at improving case-relevant communication during the procedure and to reduce excess case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation.

The hypothesis is: structured briefings during an operation reduce the incidence of SSI after surgery.","Background

A number of publications has shown a relatively high rate of complications that are related to the treatment and not to the disease. Such iatrogenic incidents are an important influence on patient morbidity and increase healthcare costs. Therefore, patient safety and minimizing the risk of iatrogenic harm has become a major concern in healthcare. Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most frequent complication in patients that undergo surgery, leading to considerable costs.

In a previous study, the investigators established an empirical relationship between communication during surgery and SSI was shown in a prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing major elective open abdominal procedures. An analysis of 11383 communication events observed by a team of trained work psychologists showed a relationship between intraoperative communication and SSI. Adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that more case-relevant communication during the entire procedure was associated with a significant reduction in organ/space SSI (odds ratio 0.861, 95% confidence interval 0.750-0.987; P=0.034). Interestingly, case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure was associated with a significant increase of incisional SSI (odds ratio 1.1153, 95% confidence interval 1.040-1.196; P=0.002). Distractors such as noise and traffic were also assessed but had no effect on SSI. The current study is based on these observations, which reveal that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI and case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for SSI.

These findings can be interpreted in light of previous studies assessing communication in surgery and similar collaborative tasks which showed that explicit task-relevant communication fosters the development of a shared mental model of the task within the team. This facilitates coordination, because all team members are informed about the state of task progress, and can better anticipate their contribution. This is particularly important in critical phases of the procedure, as well as in OR teams composed of members with different levels of knowledge and expertise. Explicit task-related communication may be particularly useful to inform non-sterile team members (anesthetists, scrub nurses) that do not have full sight of the operative field at all times.

Although case-irrelevant communication in surgical teams has been found to foster a positive team-climate, it can be seen as a distractor if it diverts the attention away from the main task. This is more likely during the closing phase (last 20 minutes), because for most of the team members, the central task is already finished, and clearing and cleaning are routine tasks. If during routine tasks the team engages in too much non-patient relevant communication, attention to the closure may be diverted.

Given the previously found results, the introduction of a clinically applicable intervention (described below) has been tested in pilot studies. This intervention aims to assure a short discussion of case-relevant aspects at specific moments of the procedure, draw the attention of the on case-relevant communication during the main phase and to prevent a high increase in case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation.

Objective

To perform a prospective clinical trial to test the impact of structured intraoperative briefings on SSI. The incidence of SSIs will be compared before and after the introduction of this intervention.

Methods

- Intraoperative briefings: First briefing: after exposure of the organ of interest, Second briefing: Intraoperative briefing before closure of the operative field.

A previous prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing elective open abdominal procedures showed that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI whereas case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for incisional SSI. Therefore, the introduction of a clinical applicable intervention ""structured briefing using the StOP protocol"" has been developed and was tested in pilot experiments. This intervention aims at improving case-relevant communication during the procedure and to reduce excess case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation. The hypothesis is: structured briefings during an operation reduce the incidence of SSI after surgery. Background A number of publications has shown a relatively high rate of complications that are related to the treatment and not to the disease. Such iatrogenic incidents are an important influence on patient morbidity and increase healthcare costs. Therefore, patient safety and minimizing the risk of iatrogenic harm has become a major concern in healthcare. Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most frequent complication in patients that undergo surgery, leading to considerable costs. In a previous study, the investigators established an empirical relationship between communication during surgery and SSI was shown in a prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing major elective open abdominal procedures. An analysis of 11383 communication events observed by a team of trained work psychologists showed a relationship between intraoperative communication and SSI. Adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that more case-relevant communication during the entire procedure was associated with a significant reduction in organ/space SSI (odds ratio 0.861, 95% confidence interval 0.750-0.987; P=0.034). Interestingly, case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure was associated with a significant increase of incisional SSI (odds ratio 1.1153, 95% confidence interval 1.040-1.196; P=0.002). Distractors such as noise and traffic were also assessed but had no effect on SSI. The current study is based on these observations, which reveal that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI and case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for SSI. These findings can be interpreted in light of previous studies assessing communication in surgery and similar collaborative tasks which showed that explicit task-relevant communication fosters the development of a shared mental model of the task within the team. This facilitates coordination, because all team members are informed about the state of task progress, and can better anticipate their contribution. This is particularly important in critical phases of the procedure, as well as in OR teams composed of members with different levels of knowledge and expertise. Explicit task-related communication may be particularly useful to inform non-sterile team members (anesthetists, scrub nurses) that do not have full sight of the operative field at all times. Although case-irrelevant communication in surgical teams has been found to foster a positive team-climate, it can be seen as a distractor if it diverts the attention away from the main task. This is more likely during the closing phase (last 20 minutes), because for most of the team members, the central task is already finished, and clearing and cleaning are routine tasks. If during routine tasks the team engages in too much non-patient relevant communication, attention to the closure may be diverted. Given the previously found results, the introduction of a clinically applicable intervention (described below) has been tested in pilot studies. This intervention aims to assure a short discussion of case-relevant aspects at specific moments of the procedure, draw the attention of the on case-relevant communication during the main phase and to prevent a high increase in case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation. Objective To perform a prospective clinical trial to test the impact of structured intraoperative briefings on SSI. The incidence of SSIs will be compared before and after the introduction of this intervention. Methods - Intraoperative briefings: First briefing: after exposure of the organ of interest, Second briefing: Intraoperative briefing before closure of the operative field. * Trainings and Retrainings * Optional Interventions: Transparent drape between anesthesia and sterile team; Controlling noise and potential distractors during wound closure; Nutritional support during the operation Inclusion Criteria: * Patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery Exclusion Criteria * Preexisting surgical site infection"

Sheffield Hallam University,OTHER,NCT06325579,Immersive Virtual Reality for Dysphagia,Immersive Virtual Reality for Dysphagia Treatment After Stroke,"People who have suffered a stroke are at high risk of suffering from oropharyngeal dysphagia with long and intensive exercise programmes. Early access to treatment and engaging therapies is very important for recovery. Immersive virtual reality technology presents an innovative treatment that could help patients improve swallowing. The aim of this study is to improve swallowing in stroke patients using two bespoke immersive virtual reality treatment with real-time feedback. The study consisted in a small feasibility study with stroke patients suffering dysphagia (n = 6, aged of 39 to 80 (M=71.17, SD=15.94). Results obtained through interviews with the patients indicated no discomfort reported during the game. All patients reported enjoying the game and feeling engaged and immersive and four out of six patients reported that they would like to use it every day as part of their Speech and Language therapy. The SALT assistant involved in the study stated that the system had the potential to encourage patients to swallow, being more functional than conventional speech therapy. She identified improvements needed for a better functioning of the VR rehabilitation system for Dysphagia. In a future study, wireless headsets will be used, without a laptop, and it will be important to improve the reliability and design of the strain gauge or innovate in the use of a different technology.","1. Design of the research.

   A priority of the team was to ensure the VR system and game experience is suitable for rehabilitation purposes and use in a clinical setting with OD patients. The research study has been designed collaboratively, with consultations between the research team and relevant clinical staff playing a key role in the development of the IVR intervention. This preliminary work has been further enhanced through:
   * Observation of clinics to establish movements required during rehabilitation.
   * A PPI / expert workshop at early development stage.
   * Play test with healthy volunteers (n = 10) to check usability, acceptability of VR and effectiveness of strain gauge measurement process.
   * Ongoing development informed by consultation with relevant parties and above stages.
2. PPI and contributions. A workshop was conducted which involved people with personal experience of or professional expertise in dysphagia and swallowing problems, which was very valuable in informing and refining the IVR intervention study.

   For this study, further IVR testing sessions were conducted utilising the updated version of the game with healthy adult volunteers. Insights gained from this final stage regarding the enjoyability, usability appropriateness and experience of the scenarios will inform any final amendments to the intervention.
3. Eligibility inclusions and exclusions. The target sample for the clinical feasibility trial was 10 adult (aged 18+) stroke in-patients receiving care at the Stroke.

   Pathway Assessment and Rehabilitation Centre (SPARC) in at STH during the recruitment period of the study.

   In addition to the above, inclusion criteria were comprehension and communication skills sufficient to understand instructions, give informed consent and communicate experiences. Interpreters was provided for people whose first language is not English. People with a mild language or cognitive impairment (common after stroke, which can affect comprehension and communication) was included and supported to participate by the local SALT. People with mild-moderate well-controlled mental health problems could be included, as well as those with a history of mildmoderate motion sickness.

   Exclusion criteria included:
   * A severe language, communication or cognitive impairment preventing full consent or engagement.
   * Hemianopia preventing stereoscopic vision.
   * Severe mental health issues which could give rise to unnecessary, psychological or physical distress during IVR use.
   * Head or neck injuries which would prevent participants wearing the IVR headset and strain gauge around the neck.
   * A history of severe motion sickness since, since IVR can occasionally stimulate motion sickness in those already strongly affected by these symptoms.

   A qualified speech therapist in the SPARC SALT team identified the eligibility of inpatients for the study, based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria.

   The two members of staff involved in delivering the intervention also took part in interviews following completion of the study.
4. Identification and recruitment of participants. Those who meet eligibility criteria may require information in a more readable, accessible format due to the impact of stroke on some people's ability to comprehend complex information. The full information sheet was designed to be thorough but also clear and easy to read. A second brief information sheet had been developed, in collaboration with a SALT expert, for use with people with mild aphasia, who may find the longer version challenging to follow. This brief version provides the main information about the study and would be reinforced verbally with explanations from a SALT clinician familiar with the full details in the longer comprehensive version of the information sheet.

   Inpatients who were judged to meet the criteria were introduced to the study by a senior SALT or other clinician (e.g.nurse, psychologist) in the SPARC team.

   If the patient expresses interest in hearing more about the study, an information sheet was provided.
5. Informed consent process. There are two versions of the information sheet. The main information sheet provides full details about the study, its inclusion and exclusion criteria, what participation involves and participant rights, including information about withdrawal and confidentiality. It is written to be clear and understandable. A second brief version has been designed and written in an aphasia-friendly way, with support from SALT clinicians, to make it appropriate for people with mild communication or comprehension difficulties. This information sheet was supplemented by verbal explanations from the SALT clinician who provides information, answers questions and takes consent. This clinician was familiar with the comprehensive information in the full information sheet. The full version of the information sheet could also be provided for family / NOK where the brief version had been used with the patient.

   Sufficient time was allowed for the patient to consider the information, ask questions and discuss the study, if they wish, with family members and friends before deciding whether to participate. No pressure was placed upon patients to participate. They were reassured verbally and in the information sheet that deciding against participation would have no consequences whatever for their future treatment.

   Since participation involved the unfamiliar experiences of wearing a VR headset and strain gauge and playing an IVR game, patients who were interested in taking part were offered an opportunity to try out the equipment and experience before making a final decision and giving formal consent.

   After the patient tried out, feels comfortable with the equipment and IVR experience, and wishes to proceed, formal written consent was taken. If the UVR experience or equipment was not comfortable for the patient, they could decide against proceeding, and may indeed be advised not to do so by the SALT Assistant. In this case, they continued with their usual SALT care.

   The SALT staff members involved in the VR trials was invited by email and sent an information sheet about the interview they were asked to attend, with opportunities for questions. Their written consent was taken by email return of a consent form.
6. Right to withdraw. During the recruitment, information-giving and consent-taking process, participants was assured of the right to withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason. If participants asked to be withdrawn from the study during or after consent had been taken and procedures started, identifiable data already collected with consent would be retained and used in the study. No further data would be collected, or any other research procedures carried out on or in relation to the participant. This was explained in the information sheet.
7. Risks/burdens and benefits.

   a. Risks:

   - Dizziness and Nausea (a rare side effect of IVR experience in a few people). Some people may find the IVR environment disorientating (e.g. in very early versions there were occasional issues with confusion, nausea, dizziness). To avoid any unnecessary discomfort or distress for participants, it was ensured all those interested in participating had the chance to try out a IVR environment before agreeing to take part. If they felt uncomfortable during the procedure, the IVR could be removed at any stage. They were clearly informed about this before the procedure started and were carefully monitored throughout.

   The SALT assistant worked with the patient each time the IVR is used to ensure that they are comfortable in using the equipment during their SALT session. All practitioners had been trained in using the system prior to the start of the study.

   - Discomfort from the neck band / strain gauge. A specialist company, Footfalls and Heartbeats, had designed a bespoke fabric collar for the purpose of the study, comprising background and sensor yarns. The ""background yarn""was composed of interior elastane yarn (6%) and exterior nylon yarn (94%). Both materials were used extensively in clothing. The sensor yarn, a thin gold and black area in the middle of the band, was a plied yarn. This means that two types of yarn were twisted together. None of these yarns were touch the skin of the patient. The yarns were merino wool, the dark colour and a silver (Ag 99.9%) plated polyester yarn, the gold yarn. The band was knitted on a Stoll ADF flatbed knitting machine at Footfalls and Heartbeats (UK) Limited lab in Nottingham. The knitting technique was weft knitting and this allowed for maximum stretch and comfort in the product for the patient.

   Each patient had their own sensor band for the period of the trial. In the unlikely case that washing was required between uses, a careful handwashing process was used. Similar products to these had washed 150 times at 30C in a home environment and the sensor functionality and size and shape of product have continued to function as required.

   Although we couldn't guarantee the band is hypo-allergenic, the Ag coated yarn was unlikely to cause any reaction and was used extensively in medical environments. The nylon base layer fabric was known to create some issues if left on human skin for long periods of time but was routinely used as a medical grade yarn in compression hosiery. Participants would be wearing the band for short periods for the study so allergic reaction is unlikely. The materials used in the band which make skin contact are mentioned in the information sheet.

   As part of the pre-consent checks, participants were offered the opportunity to try out the neck band to see how it feels and decide if it feels comfortable enough to wear during the trial.

   - Infection Control: Each participant had their own dedicated VR kit to use for the duration of their involvement with the trial to prevent cross-infection. In addition, disposable covers was used for the headset, and thorough cleaning took place before and after each use of the equipment. Disinfection took place before and after each set of equipment is allocated to / used by each patient.

   Hospital measures to prevent infection, e.g. from HAIs, Covid-19, were adopted by people involved with the study on all visits to patient, e.g. social distance, PPE, thorough hand washing / sanitisation.

   The VR kit and audio recorder were thorough cleaned and disinfected after use before leaving hospital.

   - Confidentiality of developing software As the study was developing and employing a novel, bespoke intervention, the confidentiality of this product was protected by asking participants to sign non-disclosure agreements at the time of consent. This is explained in the information sheet and explanations was repeated verbally.
8. Confidentiality and anonymity Data collected for the study was treated with the utmost care, stored on password-protected University drives, with non-anonymised and anonymised data files kept separately, with access restricted to the research team.

Hard copy consent forms was kept in locked University cabinets during the study.

Interview audio recordings was deleted from the recorders following their transcription and saved as audio files in password protected computer files, ready for transcription. Some qualitative data extracts were reported verbatim; however personally identifiable details were removed prior to analysis and dissemination; therefore, others should not be able to identify individuals from reports.

It is expected that publications will result from the study; therefore, data will be retained for at least 10 years in the SHU Data Archive (SHURDA) in keeping with the SHU policy on data storage.","Inclusion Criteria:

This preliminary work has been further enhanced through: * Observation of clinics to establish movements required during rehabilitation. * A PPI / expert workshop at early development stage. * Play test with healthy volunteers (n = 10) to check usability, acceptability of VR and effectiveness of strain gauge measurement process. * Ongoing development informed by consultation with relevant parties and above stages. 2. PPI and contributions. A workshop was conducted which involved people with personal experience of or professional expertise in dysphagia and swallowing problems, which was very valuable in informing and refining the IVR intervention study. For this study, further IVR testing sessions were conducted utilising the updated version of the game with healthy adult volunteers. Insights gained from this final stage regarding the enjoyability, usability appropriateness and experience of the scenarios will inform any final amendments to the intervention. 3. Eligibility inclusions and exclusions. The target sample for the clinical feasibility trial was 10 adult (aged 18+) stroke in-patients receiving care at the Stroke. Pathway Assessment and Rehabilitation Centre (SPARC) in at STH during the recruitment period of the study. In addition to the above, inclusion criteria were comprehension and communication skills sufficient to understand instructions, give informed consent and communicate experiences. Interpreters was provided for people whose first language is not English. People with a mild language or cognitive impairment (common after stroke, which can affect comprehension and communication) was included and supported to participate by the local SALT. People with mild-moderate well-controlled mental health problems could be included, as well as those with a history of mildmoderate motion sickness. Exclusion criteria included: * A severe language, communication or cognitive impairment preventing full consent or engagement. * Hemianopia preventing stereoscopic vision. * Severe mental health issues which could give rise to unnecessary, psychological or physical distress during IVR use. * Head or neck injuries which would prevent participants wearing the IVR headset and strain gauge around the neck. * A history of severe motion sickness since, since IVR can occasionally stimulate motion sickness in those already strongly affected by these symptoms. A qualified speech therapist in the SPARC SALT team identified the eligibility of inpatients for the study, based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. The two members of staff involved in delivering the intervention also took part in interviews following completion of the study. 4. Identification and recruitment of participants. Those who meet eligibility criteria may require information in a more readable, accessible format due to the impact of stroke on some people's ability to comprehend complex information. The full information sheet was designed to be thorough but also clear and easy to read. A second brief information sheet had been developed, in collaboration with a SALT expert, for use with people with mild aphasia, who may find the longer version challenging to follow. This brief version provides the main information about the study and would be reinforced verbally with explanations from a SALT clinician familiar with the full details in the longer comprehensive version of the information sheet. Inpatients who were judged to meet the criteria were introduced to the study by a senior SALT or other clinician (e.g.nurse, psychologist) in the SPARC team. If the patient expresses interest in hearing more about the study, an information sheet was provided. 5. Informed consent process. There are two versions of the information sheet. The main information sheet provides full details about the study, its inclusion and exclusion criteria, what participation involves and participant rights, including information about withdrawal and confidentiality. It is written to be clear and understandable. A second brief version has been designed and written in an aphasia-friendly way, with support from SALT clinicians, to make it appropriate for people with mild communication or comprehension difficulties. This information sheet was supplemented by verbal explanations from the SALT clinician who provides information, answers questions and takes consent. This clinician was familiar with the comprehensive information in the full information sheet. The full version of the information sheet could also be provided for family / NOK where the brief version had been used with the patient. Sufficient time was allowed for the patient to consider the information, ask questions and discuss the study, if they wish, with family members and friends before deciding whether to participate. No pressure was placed upon patients to participate. They were reassured verbally and in the information sheet that deciding against participation would have no consequences whatever for their future treatment. Since participation involved the unfamiliar experiences of wearing a VR headset and strain gauge and playing an IVR game, patients who were interested in taking part were offered an opportunity to try out the equipment and experience before making a final decision and giving formal consent. After the patient tried out, feels comfortable with the equipment and IVR experience, and wishes to proceed, formal written consent was taken. If the UVR experience or equipment was not comfortable for the patient, they could decide against proceeding, and may indeed be advised not to do so by the SALT Assistant. In this case, they continued with their usual SALT care. The SALT staff members involved in the VR trials was invited by email and sent an information sheet about the interview they were asked to attend, with opportunities for questions. Their written consent was taken by email return of a consent form. 6. Right to withdraw. During the recruitment, information-giving and consent-taking process, participants was assured of the right to withdraw from the study at any time, without giving a reason. If participants asked to be withdrawn from the study during or after consent had been taken and procedures started, identifiable data already collected with consent would be retained and used in the study. No further data would be collected, or any other research procedures carried out on or in relation to the participant. This was explained in the information sheet. 7. Risks/burdens and benefits. a. Risks: - Dizziness and Nausea (a rare side effect of IVR experience in a few people). Some people may find the IVR environment disorientating (e.g. in very early versions there were occasional issues with confusion, nausea, dizziness). To avoid any unnecessary discomfort or distress for participants, it was ensured all those interested in participating had the chance to try out a IVR environment before agreeing to take part. If they felt uncomfortable during the procedure, the IVR could be removed at any stage. They were clearly informed about this before the procedure started and were carefully monitored throughout. The SALT assistant worked with the patient each time the IVR is used to ensure that they are comfortable in using the equipment during their SALT session. All practitioners had been trained in using the system prior to the start of the study. - Discomfort from the neck band / strain gauge. A specialist company, Footfalls and Heartbeats, had designed a bespoke fabric collar for the purpose of the study, comprising background and sensor yarns. The ""background yarn""was composed of interior elastane yarn (6%) and exterior nylon yarn (94%). Both materials were used extensively in clothing. The sensor yarn, a thin gold and black area in the middle of the band, was a plied yarn. This means that two types of yarn were twisted together. None of these yarns were touch the skin of the patient. The yarns were merino wool, the dark colour and a silver (Ag 99.9%) plated polyester yarn, the gold yarn. The band was knitted on a Stoll ADF flatbed knitting machine at Footfalls and Heartbeats (UK) Limited lab in Nottingham. The knitting technique was weft knitting and this allowed for maximum stretch and comfort in the product for the patient. Each patient had their own sensor band for the period of the trial. In the unlikely case that washing was required between uses, a careful handwashing process was used. Similar products to these had washed 150 times at 30C in a home environment and the sensor functionality and size and shape of product have continued to function as required. Although we couldn't guarantee the band is hypo-allergenic, the Ag coated yarn was unlikely to cause any reaction and was used extensively in medical environments. The nylon base layer fabric was known to create some issues if left on human skin for long periods of time but was routinely used as a medical grade yarn in compression hosiery. Participants would be wearing the band for short periods for the study so allergic reaction is unlikely. The materials used in the band which make skin contact are mentioned in the information sheet. As part of the pre-consent checks, participants were offered the opportunity to try out the neck band to see how it feels and decide if it feels comfortable enough to wear during the trial. - Infection Control: Each participant had their own dedicated VR kit to use for the duration of their involvement with the trial to prevent cross-infection. In addition, disposable covers was used for the headset, and thorough cleaning took place before and after each use of the equipment. Disinfection took place before and after each set of equipment is allocated to / used by each patient. Hospital measures to prevent infection, e.g. from HAIs, Covid-19, were adopted by people involved with the study on all visits to patient, e.g. social distance, PPE, thorough hand washing / sanitisation. The VR kit and audio recorder were thorough cleaned and disinfected after use before leaving hospital. - Confidentiality of developing software As the study was developing and employing a novel, bespoke intervention, the confidentiality of this product was protected by asking participants to sign non-disclosure agreements at the time of consent. This is explained in the information sheet and explanations was repeated verbally. 8. Confidentiality and anonymity Data collected for the study was treated with the utmost care, stored on password-protected University drives, with non-anonymised and anonymised data files kept separately, with access restricted to the research team. Hard copy consent forms was kept in locked University cabinets during the study. Interview audio recordings was deleted from the recorders following their transcription and saved as audio files in password protected computer files, ready for transcription. Some qualitative data extracts were reported verbatim; however personally identifiable details were removed prior to analysis and dissemination; therefore, others should not be able to identify individuals from reports. It is expected that publications will result from the study; therefore, data will be retained for at least 10 years in the SHU Data Archive (SHURDA) in keeping with the SHU policy on data storage.

* Of the several drugs and drug combinations approved for treatment of relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the reported complete response rates are no greater than 30%.
* Obinutuzumab is a glycoengineered, humanized type 2 anti-cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) monoclonal antibody thought to engage the immune system by directly activating antibody-dependent, cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); it is approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with chlorambucil.
* The key mediators of ADCC are polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells.
* Recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) is a stimulatory cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes, and long-term cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) + memory T-cells. In a Phase I trial, administration of rhIL-15 as a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion (civ) was associated with up to 45-fold increase in the number of NK cells at well tolerated dose levels.
* Preclinical murine lymphoid malignancy models have shown increased efficacy of monoclonal antibodies when administered together with recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15); BL/6 mice inoculated with EL4 murine T-cell lymphoma expressing human cluster of differentiation 20 (EL4-CD20) cells (a syngeneic lymphoma line); including significant prolongation of survival with the IL-15/Rituximab combination compared to either drug given as single agent (90% v. 30% alive at 75 days).

Background: * Of the several drugs and drug combinations approved for treatment of relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the reported complete response rates are no greater than 30%. * Obinutuzumab is a glycoengineered, humanized type 2 anti-cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) monoclonal antibody thought to engage the immune system by directly activating antibody-dependent, cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); it is approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with chlorambucil. * The key mediators of ADCC are polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. * Recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) is a stimulatory cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes, and long-term cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) + memory T-cells. In a Phase I trial, administration of rhIL-15 as a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion (civ) was associated with up to 45-fold increase in the number of NK cells at well tolerated dose levels. * Preclinical murine lymphoid malignancy models have shown increased efficacy of monoclonal antibodies when administered together with recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15); BL/6 mice inoculated with EL4 murine T-cell lymphoma expressing human cluster of differentiation 20 (EL4-CD20) cells (a syngeneic lymphoma line); including significant prolongation of survival with the IL-15/Rituximab combination compared to either drug given as single agent (90% v. 30% alive at 75 days).

The overall purpose of this study is to provide reassurance on the safety and efficacy of cadazolid in children suffering from infection due to Clostridium difficile. This multicenter, study will be run into two parts. Both parts will be run in consecutive age cohorts, starting from the oldest age categories(12 to \< 18 years old) to the youngest (birth to \< 3 months). * Part A is an open-label, dose finding part to be conducted in at least 24 subjects. * Part B follows a randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel-group design with vancomycin used as an active comparator. Part B will be conducted in about 176 children. In both parts, the treatment period will be 10 days and will be followed by a Follow-up period of 28-32 days. Key Inclusion Criteria: * Signed informed consent by parents or legally authorized representatives (LAR) and assent by the child according to local requirements prior to initiation of any study-mandated procedure. * Male or female from birth to \< 18 years of age, diagnosed with Clostridium Difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). * Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and must agree to use an adequate and reliable method of contraception. Key Exclusion Criteria: * Positive Rotavirus test for subjects \< 5 years. * Fulminant or life-threatening CDAD. * More than one previous episode of CDAD in the 3 month period prior to enrollment / randomization. * Antimicrobial treatment active against CDAD administered within 24 h prior to screening except for metronidazole treatment failures (MTF). * Subjects with body weight \< 3 kg. * Inflammatory bowel disease, chronic abdominal pain, or chronic diarrhea of any etiology. * Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), immunoglobulin therapy, or any investigational drug to prevent or treat CDAD within 1 month period (or 5 half-lives in case of investigational drug, whichever is longer) prior to enrollment / randomization. * Monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile within 6 months prior to enrollment / randomization. * Previous vaccination against C. difficile. * Known mental disorders. * Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect the subject's full participation in the study, or compliance with the protocol."

Excessive distant failures rates using prior adjuvant systemic therapies, may have limited the impact of radiation therapy; therefore, improvements in systemic control can increase the benefit of local control.

In this study, the investigators utilize 5 fraction PRT, delivered over 1 week, during adjuvant FFX (between cycles 6 and 7) to minimize the interruptions in chemotherapy as well as to reduce the length of time from surgical resection to initiating adjuvant radiation therapy. Conventional radiation therapy is typically delivered over 5 weeks and is commonly given after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Conventional radiation therapy cannot be given concurrently with FFX due to the synergistic toxicities. In contrast, PRT significantly reduces the exposure of normal tissues to the effects of radiation therapy and has been safely delivered using a 5 fraction schedule with chemotherapy, as previously discussed.

Chemotherapy will consist of mFOLFIRINOX in 14-day cycles x 12 as used in the PRODIGE 24 study:

Columbia University,OTHER,NCT00005479,"Diabetes, Lipoproteins and Accelerated Vascular Disease",Measures of Postprandial Lipoproteins Are Not Associated With Coronary Artery Disease in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,To better understand the excess cardiovascular disease associated with diabetes mellitus.,"BACKGROUND:

Diabetes mellitus is associated with a 2-4 fold increase in risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary artery disease, is the leading cause of death in diabetics. The study was a subproject within a program project grant, with Henry Ginsberg as principal investigator. The program project was part of an institute-initiated study on The Etiology of Excess Cardiovascular Disease in Diabetes Mellitus. The initiative originated after discussions between NHLBI and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (JDFI). The Request for Applications (RFA) was originally issued in October 1994 and resulted in the award of one grant The RFA was reissued in December 1995 and resulted in the awarding of five program project grants, the one under discussion among them.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study, subproject 3 within a program project grant, was entitled Atherogenic Triglyceride Rich Lipoproteins in Diabetes. The subproject examined the atherogenicity of hypertriglyceridemia in subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Subproject 3 tested hypotheses concerning the impact of the size and number of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) on risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in several human populations. A case-control study of diabetics with or without coronary artery disease determined if TGRL size and number differed between the groups. In this study, Whites, Blacks and Hispanics with documented coronary artery disease or with less than 50 percent coronary stenosis by angiography were recruited. The hypothesis was tested that increased apoB in small TGRL was associated with coronary artery disease. Fasting and postprandial blood samples were obtained for measurement of TGRL apoB level, TGRL TG:apoB ratio, the amount of apoB in apoE-rich TGRL, and retinyl palmitate clearance. Allelic differences in the apoB, apoE, LPL, and apoCIII genes were examined for effects on the size and number of TGRL: specific hypotheses were tested regarding the impact of these alleles.

TGRL size and number were also compared in diabetics with and without carotid atherosclerosis in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, in Sioux and Pima Indian tribes that differed in ASCVD rates, and in Blacks, Whites and Hispanics with a range of insulin levels and insulin resistance in the Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS). These studies served both to confirm findings in the case-control study and to provide the opportunity to investigate diverse populations. The collaboration with IRAS allowed determination of the effects of insulin resistance and insulin secretory capacity on TGRL size and number. Finally, experiments with cultured endothelial cells were performed to determine if small TGRL could cause endothelial dysfunction. PMI-1 and VCAM-1 were markers of TGRL effects. In the case-control study, plasma PMI and VCAM-1 were measured to examine their relationship to coronary artery disease and to TGRL size and number.

Dollars awarded were estimated based on the CRISP assignment of $173,249 dollars in FY 1996 for Subproject 3. This was approximately 25 percent of the total dollars awarded and was used to estimated committed dollars.","Inclusion criteria

"BL&H Co., Ltd",INDUSTRY,NCT02104284,A Comparative Bronchial Provocation Study With Mannitol and Methacolinie in a Korean Population,A Comparative Bronchial Provocation Study With Mannitol and Methacolinie in a Korean Population,Asthmatic patients and non-asthmatic controls were recruited prospectively from four referral hospitals in Korea. Participants were challenged with each of methacholine and mannitol inhalation on different days. Their diagnostic utility was evaluated by calculating their sensitivity and specificity for asthma diagnosis. Response-dose-ratio was also compared.,"This study was a prospective, multicenter study performed at four referral hospitals in Korea: Seoul National University Hospital, Samsung Medical Center, Ajou University Hospital, and Hanyang University Medical Center. Hospital-based recruitment was performed for asthmatic patients and non-asthmatic controls. Asthmatic patients were defined as those who had been diagnosed with asthma by specialist physicians; they had recurrent symptoms of asthma (wheezing and dyspnea) and used anti-asthmatic medication for 6 months before the enrollment. Non-asthmatic controls were voluntarily recruited from hospital visitors; they were included if they had never wheeze or physician diagnosed asthma.

Common inclusion criteria were Korean adults between the age of 18 and 70 years who could understand and perform lung function tests and bronchial challenges. Exclusion criteria were any one of following: history of recent respiratory infection (within the last 4 weeks), history of a recent surgery, history of heart disease that could impose risks during bronchial challenges, history of uncontrolled hypertension, current smokers or ex-smokers with more than 10 pack-years, history of known pulmonary diseases with the exception of asthma, pregnancy or lactation, severe obesity (body mass index \[BMI\] of \>35 kg/m2), history of any health condition considered inappropriate for participation in this study, or a pre-bronchodilator predictive value of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of \<70%.

All participants underwent methacholine bronchial challenge test and mannitol challenge test on different days, separated by least 24 h, as in previous reports.7, 10 All asthmatic patients stopped their anti-asthma medications before the tests according to the predetermined protocols. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital. All subjects gave written informed consent.

Methacholine challenge test\> The methacholine challenge test was performed as previously described.11, 12 Pulmonary function testing was carried out using a spirometry system (SensorMedics 2130; SensorMedics, CA, USA). The methacholine challenge test was performed using the Chai method13 with minor modifications. Briefly, methacholine was prepared at the following concentrations, diluted with saline: 0.25, 0.625, 1, 4, 16, and 25 mg/mL. Methacholine was delivered as an aerosol by a Rosenthal-French dosimeter (Laboratory for Applied Immunology, Inc., Baltimore, MD) and a nebulizer. Subjects were instructed to inhale five inspiratory capacity breaths while increasing the methacholine concentration from 0.25 to 25 mg/mL. The methacholine concentration that caused a 20% decrease in the FEV1 from baseline was defined as PC20. AHR was defined as positive at PC20 \< 16 mg/mL.

Mannitol challenge test\> A commercial mannitol (Aridol™; BL\&H Co., Ltd., South Korea) kit was used, and the challenge test was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols.14 The mannitol capsule dose started at 0 mg and increased to a total cumulative dose of 635 mg. Each capsule was placed in the inhalation device, and a hole was made by pressing the device button before inhalation. After a deep breath of mannitol, the FEV1 was measured after 60 seconds. The test was considered positive if the FEV1 value decreased by more than 15% compared with the baseline FEV1. The cumulative mannitol dose that caused a 15% decrease in the FEV1 from baseline was defined as PD15. If the FEV1 did not decline by more than 15%, the dose was increased until a cumulative dose of 635 mg was reached. If the FEV1 did not fall by more than 15% until the last dose, the test was considered negative.","Inclusion Criteria:

Participants were challenged with each of methacholine and mannitol inhalation on different days. Their diagnostic utility was evaluated by calculating their sensitivity and specificity for asthma diagnosis. Response-dose-ratio was also compared. This study was a prospective, multicenter study performed at four referral hospitals in Korea: Seoul National University Hospital, Samsung Medical Center, Ajou University Hospital, and Hanyang University Medical Center. Hospital-based recruitment was performed for asthmatic patients and non-asthmatic controls. Asthmatic patients were defined as those who had been diagnosed with asthma by specialist physicians; they had recurrent symptoms of asthma (wheezing and dyspnea) and used anti-asthmatic medication for 6 months before the enrollment. Non-asthmatic controls were voluntarily recruited from hospital visitors; they were included if they had never wheeze or physician diagnosed asthma. Common inclusion criteria were Korean adults between the age of 18 and 70 years who could understand and perform lung function tests and bronchial challenges. Exclusion criteria were any one of following: history of recent respiratory infection (within the last 4 weeks), history of a recent surgery, history of heart disease that could impose risks during bronchial challenges, history of uncontrolled hypertension, current smokers or ex-smokers with more than 10 pack-years, history of known pulmonary diseases with the exception of asthma, pregnancy or lactation, severe obesity (body mass index \[BMI\] of \>35 kg/m2), history of any health condition considered inappropriate for participation in this study, or a pre-bronchodilator predictive value of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of \<70%. All participants underwent methacholine bronchial challenge test and mannitol challenge test on different days, separated by least 24 h, as in previous reports.7, 10 All asthmatic patients stopped their anti-asthma medications before the tests according to the predetermined protocols. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital. All subjects gave written informed consent. Methacholine challenge test\> The methacholine challenge test was performed as previously described.11, 12 Pulmonary function testing was carried out using a spirometry system (SensorMedics 2130; SensorMedics, CA, USA). The methacholine challenge test was performed using the Chai method13 with minor modifications. Briefly, methacholine was prepared at the following concentrations, diluted with saline: 0.25, 0.625, 1, 4, 16, and 25 mg/mL. Methacholine was delivered as an aerosol by a Rosenthal-French dosimeter (Laboratory for Applied Immunology, Inc., Baltimore, MD) and a nebulizer. Subjects were instructed to inhale five inspiratory capacity breaths while increasing the methacholine concentration from 0.25 to 25 mg/mL. The methacholine concentration that caused a 20% decrease in the FEV1 from baseline was defined as PC20. AHR was defined as positive at PC20 \< 16 mg/mL. Mannitol challenge test\> A commercial mannitol (Aridol™; BL\&H Co., Ltd., South Korea) kit was used, and the challenge test was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols.14 The mannitol capsule dose started at 0 mg and increased to a total cumulative dose of 635 mg. Each capsule was placed in the inhalation device, and a hole was made by pressing the device button before inhalation. After a deep breath of mannitol, the FEV1 was measured after 60 seconds. The test was considered positive if the FEV1 value decreased by more than 15% compared with the baseline FEV1. The cumulative mannitol dose that caused a 15% decrease in the FEV1 from baseline was defined as PD15. If the FEV1 did not decline by more than 15%, the dose was increased until a cumulative dose of 635 mg was reached. If the FEV1 did not fall by more than 15% until the last dose, the test was considered negative.

In this study, ipilimumab will be administered as recently approved by the FDA (3 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments). Palliative RT will start within 2 days of the first ipilimumab dose. Patients will be seen at least every 12 weeks for follow-up following completion of ipilimumab therapy until progression of disease by imaging criteria or increased symptomatology that requires another therapy. A total of 20 patients with previously treated unresectable metastatic melanoma requiring palliative radiation therapy will be treated on this pilot study over approximately 18 months. All subjects who receive study drug will be monitored for safety. Relevant tumor imaging studies will be obtained at baseline, 2-4 weeks following the 4th/last dose of ipilimumab, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. This study will provide the safety data (and possibly early efficacy signals) needed to proceed with a randomized Phase II study for proof of principle. If compelling data is obtained supporting this IT + RT vaccine strategy, this approach will be extended to other solid tumor types. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Signed Written Informed Consent Before any study procedures are performed, subjects (or their legally acceptable representatives) will have the details of the study described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent document to read. Then, if subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate that consent by signing and dating the informed consent document in the presence of study personnel. 2. Target Population * Histologically confirmed Stage IV melanoma. * Must have failed at least one systemic therapy for malignant melanoma or be intolerant to at least one prior systemic treatment. * Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible.

Target Disease Exceptions * Subjects on any other systemic therapy for cancer, including any other experimental treatment. * Prior treatment with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody if treatment failure was due to adverse events (AEs). If a subject was discontinued from the prior anti-CTLA-4 treatment due to an AE or serious adverse event (SAE), regardless of the type of event, that discontinuation constitutes an exclusion criterion. If AEs were serious enough to require a subject's withdrawal from prior treatment, the subject should be excluded from this study. * A history of AEs with prior IL-2 or Interferon will not preclude subjects from entering the current study. * Subjects who relapsed in study MDX010-16 are not eligible for this study. 3.

"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",OTHER,NCT04502979,Learning to Love Mealtime Together,Enhancing Caregiver-Infant Communication to Prevent Obesity,"Infancy is an important target period for obesity prevention because once obese as an infant, the relative risk of remaining obese appears to rise with increasing age at great cost to both individuals and society. The ability to self-regulate energy intake (eating when hungry and stopping when full) is vital to obesity prevention and it is thought that this ability can be derailed by a chronic mismatch between parental feeding behavior and the infant's state (feeding in the absence of hunger and/or feeding beyond fullness). The study will test a novel intervention to help parents and pre-verbal infants better understand one another during feeding and it will offer new insight into how self-regulation of energy intake develops during infancy.","Once obese as an infant, the relative risk of remaining obese appears to rise with increasing age. Thus, the early years of life have been posited as an important target period for obesity prevention. Widely viewed as a response to genetic, interpersonal, and environmental factors, obesity fundamentally reflects an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. Self-regulation of energy intake aligned with physiologic need is essential to this balance. The process(es) by which infants begin to disassociate eating behavior from physiologic need is unclear, thus it is crucial to better understand predictors of individual differences in self-regulation of energy intake. It is well established that autonomic regulation may support infant behavioral regulation, suggesting that autonomic function may be a critical area to consider here. Moreover, self-regulation is strongly influenced by dyadic interaction quality during infancy, and findings reveal that more responsive interactions are associated with more effective autonomic regulation. A chronic mismatch between a caregiver's feeding behavior and the infant's state (feeding in the absence of hunger and/or feeding beyond fullness), is thought to contribute to obesity by undermining the infant's capacity to self-regulate intake; the current proposal will be the first to examine the effects on autonomic regulation. The investigators propose an intervention to enrich the capacity of mother-infant dyads to perform their respective interactive tasks. The investigators plan to teach mothers American Sign Language (ASL) signs indicative of hunger, thirst, and satiety, which they will in turn teach their preverbal infant. This training in ASL will be augmented with targeted information for mothers about infants' capacities to self-regulate energy intake in response to hunger and satiety and communicate those states with intention. Mothers also will be taught about expected development of infants' eating behaviors and nutritional requirements to support healthy growth.

Using a two-group randomized repeated measures design, this study aims to 1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study methods, including recruitment, enrollment, and data collection (self-report, anthropometrics, video observations, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia \[RSA\]) for infants and their mothers; 2) evaluate the initial impact of the intervention on observed feeding interactions, reported infant feeding behaviors and maternal feeding behaviors/beliefs, and infant nutritional intake and growth; and, 3) explore preliminary data on concordance between dyadic feeding interactions and autonomic regulation in both mothers and infants (RSA). In addition to a variety of self-report and anthropometric measures, this study will use integrated behavioral (video) and physiologic (RSA) measures to better understand feeding dynamics and their relationship with obesity risk. Understanding these processes is essential for developing appropriate preventions, or interventions, that will help reduce the prevalence of early childhood obesity and its extension into later childhood and beyond.

Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD),NIH,NCT00680979,Preventing Excessive Weight Gain in Adolescent Girls at High-Risk for Adult Obesity,Preventing Excessive Weight Gain in Adolescent Girls at High-Risk for Adult Obesity,"This study will examine whether interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) can help reduce excessive weight gain in adolescent girls. It will compare the effectiveness of IPT with a teen health education program in preventing weight gain.

Adolescent girls between 12 and 17 years of age who are at risk for becoming overweight adults, by virtue of being above average weight and experiencing episodes of loss of control over eating, may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened in two visits with the following procedures:

Visit 1

* Height and weight measurements.
* Interview and questionnaires about the child s general health, social and psychological functioning and eating patterns and behaviors.

Visit 2

* Physical examination, blood and urine tests.
* DXA scan to measure body fat, muscle and bone mineral content.
* Laboratory test meal. The child fills out a rating scale about her level of hunger and is then given a food buffet from which she is instructed to eat as much as she wants. Immediately after eating, the child again completes the hunger rating forms.
* Interview about the child s mood and psychological functioning.

Participants are assigned at random to either the IPT or teen health education program. All participants have a 1- to 1 1/2-hour individual session with a therapist, followed by 12 weekly group sessions of 1 1/2 hours each in their assigned program. They are assessed at the end of the program with questionnaires and body measurements. They return to the clinic after 6 months for body measurements, blood test, DXA scan, questionnaires, interview and a test meal, and again at 1 year for body measurements, questionnaires and a DXA scan.","The most prevalent disordered eating pattern described in overweight youth is loss of control (LOC) eating, during which individuals experience an inability to control the amount of food they are consuming. LOC eating appears to be associated cross-sectionally with greater adiposity in children and adolescents, and appears to predispose youth to gain weight or body fat above that expected due to normal growth, thus likely contributing to obesity in susceptible individuals. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), a form of psychotherapy that has been adapted for the treatment of eating disorders, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing binge eating episodes and inducing modest weight loss (or at least weight stabilization) among adults diagnosed with binge eating disorder. We adapted group IPT for the targeted prevention of excessive weight gain (IPT-WG) among adolescent girls. Our pilot data support the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week group IPT-WG trial among adolescent girls at high risk for obesity who report LOC eating, and preliminary findings suggest that IPT-WG has the potential to prevent excessive weight gain. We now propose an adequately powered clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of IPT-WG compared to a standard-of-care health education for stabilizing weight and body fat gain trajectories in 117 adolescent girls at high risk for adult obesity who report LOC eating. Participants will be randomly assigned to a 12-week group IPT-WG or health education group; anthropometric variables will be measured at baseline, immediately after, and for up to 1 year following the initiation of treatment. We will assess the efficacy of IPT-WG in improving social functioning and reducing negative mood, disturbed eating patterns, and emotional distress. We also aim to determine the impact of IPT-WG on objective measures of LOC eating during a test meal and on appetitive hormones.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria.

* Female.
* Age 12 17 years.
* BMI between 75th and 97th percentile.
* English speaking.
* Good general health.
* Participants must have normal laboratory testing, including negative urine glucose and normal electrolytes, hepatic, and thyroid function, or they will be referred for treatment.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

Individuals will be excluded (and referred to non-experimental treatment programs as needed):

* Presence of major illnesses: renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyper- or hypothyroidism), hematological problems or pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiring continuous medication). Non-serious medical illnesses, such as seasonal allergies, will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
* Presence of an obesity-related medical complication that would require a more aggressive weight loss intervention approach. Such comorbidities include hyperlipidemia (LDL-cholesterol greater than 160 mg/dL), hypertension (defined by age-, sex-, and height- specific standards fasting hyperglycemia (fasting glucose greater than 100 mg/dL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (ALT above NIH Clinical Center laboratory norms with consistent radiologic findings and absence of another cause such as infectious hepatitis).
* Regular use of prescription medications. Oral contraceptive use will be permitted, provided the contraceptive has been used for at least two months before starting study. Individuals taking medications for most conditions will be excluded, but medication use for non-serious conditions (e.g., acne) will be considered on a case-by-case basis. In particular, participants currently prescribed SSRIs, neuroleptics, tricyclics, stimulants, or any medication known to affect body weight or eating will be excluded.
* Current involvement in psychotherapy or a structured weight loss program.
* Weight loss during the past 2 months for any reason exceeding 3 per cent of body weight.
* Pregnant or recently pregnant girls (within 1 year of delivery).
* History of an eating disorder or a current eating disorder (other than binge eating disorder) as determined by medical history or if uncovered during the study s structured clinical interviews. Subjects found to have an eating disorder other than binge eating disorder at baseline will be referred to mental health specialists for further evaluation and treatment.
* Current pregnancy or breast feeding. A negative pregnancy test before starting the study will be required. Because pregnancy is a state in which weight gain is expected and appropriate, pregnant individuals would not be suitable for this study. Sexually active females must be using an effective form of birth control. These methods include total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives ( the pill ), an intrauterine device (IUD), levonogestrol implants (Norplant), or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera shots). If one of these cannot be used, contraceptive foam with a condom is recommended. Should a participant in the IPT-WG group become pregnant during the 12 weeks of therapy, she will be excluded from the group sessions. The girl s IPT-WG therapists will closely assist her in obtaining an appropriate referral to a community mental healthcare provider. The IPT-WG leaders will request a release of information so that they may communicate with the community therapist in order to facilitate a smooth transition for the girl.
* Individuals who have DSM-IV-TR major depressive disorder, psychoses, current substance or alcohol abuse, conduct disorder, or a diagnosed psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the investigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study. Individuals whose parents or guardians have current substance abuse or a diagnosed psychiatric disorder or other condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, would impede adherence with the study.
* Inability to participate in a group due to psychiatric or cognitive functioning. School placement (e.g. grade level) will be used as an estimate of cognitive functioning. The decision to include or exclude subjects for this reason is left entirely to the discretion of the investigators.
* Any other condition in the adolescent or her parents or guardians that, in the opinion of the investigators, would impede compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study.",COMPLETED,,2008-05-15,2015-04-16,2015-04-16,INTERVENTIONAL,phase2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,166.0,166.0,84.23333333333333,84.23333333333333,0,0,1,United States,Obesity,166,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Interpersonal Psychotherapy"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Health Education"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BEHAVIORAL;BEHAVIORAL,Interpersonal Psychotherapy;Health Education,1.0,1.0,,0,1.970716264345073,1.0,"Preventing Excessive Weight Gain in Adolescent Girls at High-Risk for Adult Obesity Preventing Excessive Weight Gain in Adolescent Girls at High-Risk for Adult Obesity This study will examine whether interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) can help reduce excessive weight gain in adolescent girls.

LOC eating appears to be associated cross-sectionally with greater adiposity in children and adolescents, and appears to predispose youth to gain weight or body fat above that expected due to normal growth, thus likely contributing to obesity in susceptible individuals. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), a form of psychotherapy that has been adapted for the treatment of eating disorders, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing binge eating episodes and inducing modest weight loss (or at least weight stabilization) among adults diagnosed with binge eating disorder. We adapted group IPT for the targeted prevention of excessive weight gain (IPT-WG) among adolescent girls. Our pilot data support the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week group IPT-WG trial among adolescent girls at high risk for obesity who report LOC eating, and preliminary findings suggest that IPT-WG has the potential to prevent excessive weight gain. We now propose an adequately powered clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of IPT-WG compared to a standard-of-care health education for stabilizing weight and body fat gain trajectories in 117 adolescent girls at high risk for adult obesity who report LOC eating. Participants will be randomly assigned to a 12-week group IPT-WG or health education group; anthropometric variables will be measured at baseline, immediately after, and for up to 1 year following the initiation of treatment. We will assess the efficacy of IPT-WG in improving social functioning and reducing negative mood, disturbed eating patterns, and emotional distress. We also aim to determine the impact of IPT-WG on objective measures of LOC eating during a test meal and on appetitive hormones. * INCLUSION CRITERIA: Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria. * Female. * Age 12 17 years. * BMI between 75th and 97th percentile. * English speaking. * Good general health. * Participants must have normal laboratory testing, including negative urine glucose and normal electrolytes, hepatic, and thyroid function, or they will be referred for treatment. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Individuals will be excluded (and referred to non-experimental treatment programs as needed): * Presence of major illnesses: renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, hyper- or hypothyroidism), hematological problems or pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiring continuous medication). Non-serious medical illnesses, such as seasonal allergies, will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. * Presence of an obesity-related medical complication that would require a more aggressive weight loss intervention approach. Such comorbidities include hyperlipidemia (LDL-cholesterol greater than 160 mg/dL), hypertension (defined by age-, sex-, and height- specific standards fasting hyperglycemia (fasting glucose greater than 100 mg/dL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (ALT above NIH Clinical Center laboratory norms with consistent radiologic findings and absence of another cause such as infectious hepatitis). * Regular use of prescription medications. Oral contraceptive use will be permitted, provided the contraceptive has been used for at least two months before starting study. Individuals taking medications for most conditions will be excluded, but medication use for non-serious conditions (e.g., acne) will be considered on a case-by-case basis. In particular, participants currently prescribed SSRIs, neuroleptics, tricyclics, stimulants, or any medication known to affect body weight or eating will be excluded. * Current involvement in psychotherapy or a structured weight loss program. * Weight loss during the past 2 months for any reason exceeding 3 per cent of body weight. * Pregnant or recently pregnant girls (within 1 year of delivery). * History of an eating disorder or a current eating disorder (other than binge eating disorder) as determined by medical history or if uncovered during the study s structured clinical interviews. Subjects found to have an eating disorder other than binge eating disorder at baseline will be referred to mental health specialists for further evaluation and treatment. * Current pregnancy or breast feeding. A negative pregnancy test before starting the study will be required. Because pregnancy is a state in which weight gain is expected and appropriate, pregnant individuals would not be suitable for this study. Sexually active females must be using an effective form of birth control. These methods include total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives ( the pill ), an intrauterine device (IUD), levonogestrol implants (Norplant), or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera shots). If one of these cannot be used, contraceptive foam with a condom is recommended. Should a participant in the IPT-WG group become pregnant during the 12 weeks of therapy, she will be excluded from the group sessions. The girl s IPT-WG therapists will closely assist her in obtaining an appropriate referral to a community mental healthcare provider. The IPT-WG leaders will request a release of information so that they may communicate with the community therapist in order to facilitate a smooth transition for the girl. * Individuals who have DSM-IV-TR major depressive disorder, psychoses, current substance or alcohol abuse, conduct disorder, or a diagnosed psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the investigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study. Individuals whose parents or guardians have current substance abuse or a diagnosed psychiatric disorder or other condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, would impede adherence with the study. * Inability to participate in a group due to psychiatric or cognitive functioning. School placement (e.g. grade level) will be used as an estimate of cognitive functioning. The decision to include or exclude subjects for this reason is left entirely to the discretion of the investigators. * Any other condition in the adolescent or her parents or guardians that, in the opinion of the investigators, would impede compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study."

Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre,OTHER,NCT06525779,Comparison of Requirement of External Laryngeal Manipulation in Double Lumen Tube Insertion With McGrath Laryngoscope vs Macintosh Laryngoscope. A Randomized Control Trial,Comparison of Requirement of External Laryngeal Manipulation in Double Lumen Tube Insertion With McGrath Laryngoscope vs Macintosh Laryngoscope. A Randomized Control Trial,"For anatomical and physiological isolation of the lung, a specialized endotracheal tube known as the double lumen tube (DLT) is used. The introduction of DLT into anesthesia can be attributed to Carlen's who brought forth the concept in 1949. Since then the structure of DLT has continuously evolved. Simplistically speaking; the double lumen tube is a co-axial tube i.e. it contains two tubes put together, the tube with the shorter length stays in the trachea whereas the tube with the longer length enters the right or left main bronchus. If the proximal or tracheal cuff is inflated, air entry is permitted into both lungs. However, if the distal or the bronchial cuff is inflated, ventilation is directed into either lung depending on which lumen has been clamped, at the proximal end of the tube. Conventionally the DLTs were made of red rubber and were reusable but now they have been replaced by disposable plastic tubes which make it easy to view any secretions or blood. Also, since the plastic makes for a thin wall it allows the lumen of the tube to be large enough to allow airflow with minimal resistance. Larger lumens also allow passage of suction catheters and fiber-optic bronchoscope which serves the purpose of confirming correct position of the double lumen tube after placement. Tracheal intubation with a DLT may be facilitated by maneuvers such as external laryngeal manipulation (ELM). It is a simple technique which has been used by anesthetists since many years to enable intubation. Various types of video-laryngoscopes (VL) have been found to perform a crucial part in patients with difficult airways McGrath video-laryngoscope - a portable machine - provides a better laryngeal view compared to Macintosh laryngoscopy, involving cases of intubation involving patients with normal or difficult airways. Though the use of VL for DLT placement has been reported, such studies have fallen short of producing the desired quality of evidence that is required to make a clear determination in favor of one method over the other.

This study was undertaken to investigate the blood supply of the abdominoplasty skin flap during surgery using laser fluorescent imaging. An imaging agent is injected and the fluorescence is recorded using a near-infrared laser.

Laser Fluorescent Imaging of Abdominal Skin During Abdominoplasty.

Background/Purpose

Abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) is a common cosmetic operation. One of the risks of surgery is delayed wound healing caused by impaired circulation to the skin. In an effort to reduce risk, some investigators1 advocate a limited-undermining technique, with preservation of the perforating blood vessels and preservation of the Scarpa fascia of the lower abdomen. However, there is no evidence that this limited-undermining technique improves blood supply compared with a traditional abdominoplasty dissection. Such a limited dissection may compromise the cosmetic result.

This study was undertaken to investigate the blood supply of the abdominal skin during the abdominoplasty procedure. By testing the circulation at two points during the dissection, and a third time after completion of the operation, data may be obtained and used to evaluate the effect of the extent of the dissection on blood supply of the skin flap.

Laser fluorescent imaging represents an objective measurement technique that has been used to quantitate blood supply in skin flaps and other tissues. It has been used for several years to monitor the vascularity of flaps used in breast reconstruction. This technique has also been used previously in patients undergoing abdominoplasty.2

Subjects

Twenty consecutive consenting adult men and women undergoing outpatient elective abdominoplasty will be investigated using laser fluorescent imaging. By testing the blood supply at three time points, the patient serves as his or her own control.

Imaging

The SPY Elite Intraoperative Perfusion Assessment System (Lifecell Corp., Branchburg, NJ) consists of a near-infrared laser that detects fluorescence. The imaging agent, indocyanine green, is absorbed at this region of the spectrum, 800-810 nm. The imaging agent is injected intravenously. Starting within 5-10 seconds of injection, the system records images of the abdomen, showing the fluorescence, which indicates blood supply. The half-life of the imaging agent is 2.5-3 minutes. The imaging agent is metabolized by the liver. The only known risk is an allergic reaction to the imaging agent. Patients with a history of an allergic reaction to iodinated contrast dyes are excluded.

Surgery

The lipoabdominoplasty technique is performed as described by Saldanha et al.1 Following this limited dissection, 3 mL (7.5 mg) of indocyanine green is injected and the abdominal image is recorded, documenting blood supply to the lower abdomen. After further dissection, another 3 mL of imaging agent is injected and the lower abdomen is re-imaged. On completion of surgery, a third injection is administered and a final image is recorded.

Null Hypothesis

A traditional abdominoplasty dissection does not compromise circulation compared with a more limited dissection technique.

Informed Consent

Patients are informed as to the nature of the study and are told that their participation is entirely voluntary and they are free to decline, and that doing so does not in any way prejudice their treatment. Patients are informed of the small risk of an allergic reaction that will be treated if it occurs.

Patient Risk

There is no patient risk apart from a very small risk of allergic reaction, which is further reduced by excluding any patient with a known allergy to iodinated contrast dye. The study does not affect patient treatment. It offers the possibility of detection of reduced skin circulation, information that can be used by the surgeon to limit the dissection if necessary and avoid tissue loss and delayed wound healing, known complications of abdominoplasty.

Sample Size

A sample of 20 patients is anticipated, treated over a period of approximately 6 months.

The knees, lower back and hip/groin were the most common injury locations. It has been postulated that reduced physical capacity (e.g strength, flexibility, stability) in the knees, lower back and hip/groin can increase the risk of injuries in rhythmic gymnastics.

In addition, more than 30% of the Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts experience urinary incontinence (UI), and 70% reported that UI negatively affected sports performance (Gram, M., \& Bø, K., 2020). Few of the rhythmic gymnasts had any knowledge about the pelvic floor.

Hence, this assessor blinded cluster randomized controlled trial aims to find out whether the implementation of exercises targeting reduced physical capacity and pelvic floor dysfunction can prevent/reduce the prevalence of overuse injuries and UI.","BACKGROUND

Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts have high prevalence and incidence of overuse injuries. Previous research on risk factors related to injuries in rhythmic gymnastics (RG) has implied that high weekly training load, hypermobility, poor technic and inappropriate training load increase the risk of injuries. A prospective study also found that previous injury increased the risk of injuries substantially (Gram, M., Clarsen, B., \& Bø, K., 2021). Hence, injury prevention interventions should start at an early age to avoid the first injury. In addition, since the aetiology and mechanisms of injuries are multifactorial, with a well described complex interaction of internal and external risk factors making a gymnast more or less prone to sustain an injury, there might be a need to assess some internal risk factors more thoroughly. The modifiable internal risk factor physical capacity, e.g. strength, flexibility, stability, might be of particular interest, since lack of physical capacity can be thought of as a potential underlying cause in all of the above-mentioned risk factors. In addition, it is well known how persistent lack of physical capacity relative to the requirements in a sport might lead to injuries. With knees, lower back and hip/groin as the most commonly reported injury locations, clinical assessment of strength, flexibility and stability in these locations has been conducted in a cross-sectional study before this randomized controlled trial (RCT). Reduced physical capacity revealed in the cross-sectional study will be targeted/brought forward in the exercise program in the RCT.

The most common types of pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFD) are urinary incontinence (UI), anal incontinence (AI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). UI has high prevalence among female athletes participating in sports including jumping and running (high impact). A prevalence of 80% was found in young, nulliparous high-level trampoline jumpers in Sweden (Eliasson et.al., 2008). The prevalence among Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts was \>30%, while Thyssen et.al. found that 56% of female Danish artistic gymnasts and 43% of dancers reported UI. UI negatively affects sports performance, and symptoms at young age is a risk factor of future UI developing during pregnancy and after childbirth. Hence, interventions toward prevention and treatment is necessary. While strength training of the pelvic floor muscles has 1A level of evidence/recommendation to treat UI in the general female population, and has no known adverse effects, there is little knowledge of this among young female athletes and dancers. Search on PubMed revealed only one RCT assessing the effect of pelvic floor muscle training on UI in female athletes. Ferreira et.al. randomized 32 female volleyball players to 3 months of pelvic floor muscle training or control, and found statistically significant improvement in the exercise group in frequency of leakage and urine loss measured during physical activity(p\< 0.001). Hence, there seem to be a potential for prevention and treatment also in athletes exposed to heavy load towards the pelvic floor.

AIMS

The aims of this RCT are to investigate if implementation of prophylactic exercises targeting reduced capacity and pelvic floor dysfunction can prevent/lower the prevalence of overuse injuries and UI among Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts.

Yale University,OTHER,NCT00814879,Pilot Study of a Raltegravir Based NRTI Sparing Regimen,"A Pilot Randomized, Open-Label Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of a Raltegravir Based NRTI Sparing Regimen",This pilot study will provide data on the safety and efficacy of the combination of Raltegravir (RAL) 400mg BID + Atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg BID in Antiretroviral (ARV)-experienced subjects that have a suppressed HIV viral load on a Ritonavir (RTV) boosted Protease Inhibitor (PI) based regimen who are then switched to a regimen of RAL 400mg BID +ATV 300mg BID.,"The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the virological efficacy, as measured by the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-RNA below the limit of detection (\<50 copies/mL), of two ARV regimens; patients are randomized to remain on regimens containing N(t)RTI(s) + PI/r or switch to Raltegravir + ATV but without N(t)RTI(s).

Study Arms:

1. N(t)RTI(s) based backbone + PI/r
2. Raltegravir (RAL) 400mg BID + atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg BID

Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment guidelines currently recommend ARV regimens containing a Nucleos(t)ide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors \[N(t)RTI(s)\] based backbone with a Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) or ritonavir boosted Protease Inhibitor (PI/r).(1) However, significant toxicity has been associated with N(t)RTI(s) and PI/r containing regimens. N(t)RTI(s) can cause lipoatrophy, lipid elevations, renal toxicity, neuropathy and lactic acidosis.(1) These toxicities have required clinicians and HIV-infected individuals to use alternative ARV regimens that do not use N(t)RTI(s). PIs are known to cause gastrointestinal side effects, dyslipidemia, and fat maldistribution (lipodystrophy).(1) The DHHS HIV treatment guidelines recommend that PIs should be given with a low dose of ritonavir (RTV). RTV is a PI that has an inhibitory effect on cytochrome P-450 3A4 isoenzyme which metabolizes most PIs. The addition of RTV serves as a pharmacokinetic ""booster"" by increasing PI drug concentrations.(1) However, RTV is known to increase PI side effects, elevate lipid levels and has significant drug-drug interactions with many medications given to HIV+ individuals.(1) These RTV drug interactions can complicate the medical care of an HIV-infected individual.

Raltegravir (RAL) is a recently FDA approved antiretroviral agent that inhibits HIV replication by blocking the integration of HIV proviral DNA into the host cell chromosomal DNA. RAL does not exhibit cross resistance to other ARV classes and thus has been initially used in HIV-infected individuals that are infected with drug resistant HIV strains. Recently published data on the use of RAL(2,3)in HIV-infected subjects with known ARV drug resistance or those without ARV drug resistance4 demonstrates that RAL is a potent agent, suppressing HIV viral loads in the majority of subjects and having excellent CD4 cell responses.(2-4) RAL is metabolized through glucuronidation by the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) enzyme pathway.(5)ATV is a known inhibitor of this enzyme pathway. ATV will increase RAL levels,(5) however, the current DHHS HIV treatment guidelines do not recommend a change in the dose of RAL if given with ATV as persons receiving ATV and RAL have demonstrated good tolerability of the combination and low side effect profiles.(1-3,5)

The availability of RAL provides an opportunity to examine alternative ARV strategies that may be equally efficacious and less toxic than those currently recommended in HIV treatment guidelines. Such combinations might include RAL+ATV regimen without a concomitant N(t)RTI(s) based backbone and/or the inclusion of RTV. However, there is little data available to date regarding such a combination. HIV care providers have already begun to use the combination of RAL+ unboosted ATV as the patients they care for are intolerant of RTV or have had major side effects/toxicity with N(t)NRTIs. More investigation is required to determine if RAL+ATV is an efficacious and safe alternative to RTV boosted PI based ARV strategies. Before a RAL based strategy that does not include N(t)RTIs or RTV can be compared to other ARV class strategies for long-term efficacy outcomes, preliminary data on a RAL+ATV based regimen is needed. This pilot study will provide data on the safety and efficacy of the combination of RAL 400mg BID + ATV 300 mg BID in ARV-experienced subjects that have a suppressed HIV viral load on a RTV boosted PI based regimen who are then switched to a regimen of RAL 400mg BID +ATV 300mg BID.","Inclusion Criteria:

Fabian Rohner,OTHER,NCT03448484,"Cluster Randomized, Parallel-group, Prospective, Follow-up Effectiveness Study in Kenyan Children 6-35 Months","Programme Effectiveness of an Integrated Programme to Reduce Maternal and Child Malnutrition in Kenya: Cluster Randomized, Parallel-group, Prospective, Follow-up Effectiveness Study in Children 6-35 Months of Age at Recruitment","Malnutrition is a public health problem in Kenya, with 26% of children under-five years of age stunted, and 26% of pre-school children, 26% of women of reproductive age and 42% of pregnant women being anaemic, respectively. Agriculture is the main source of income, food and nutrients for the majority of rural families in Sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya. Most farmers are smallholders and are vulnerable to poor nutrition. Thus far, programmes have mostly focused on increasing yields and household income, but not on improving nutritional status. One Acre Fund (1AF) has over the past 10 years successfully introduced an agriculture programme to smallholder farmers in Western Kenya focusing on improving harvest. 1AF is therefore well placed to transform an existing and successful agriculture programme into the world's largest 'nutrition network' for farmers, and it is the hope that a partnership between Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) and 1AF will create a strong voice for nutrition within the agriculture sector. The project aims to use an integrated programme by introducing nutrition-sensitive (improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH): e.g. soap for hand washing) and nutrition-specific (e.g. micronutrient supplements) components to 1AF's agricultural programme.

The impact of such an integrated programme will be assessed in a cluster-randomized intervention study in children 6-35 months at recruitment comparing one group receiving the integrated intervention to another group receiving the agricultural intervention (already in place).","Background/introduction:

Malnutrition, and particularly malnutrition in children under 5 years of age, remains a public health problem in many areas of the world \[1\]. A diet low in diversity and micronutrient density is one contributing factor while a second factor is poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices often leading to diseases such as persistent diarrhoea and resulting in morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years of age. According to the WHO World Health Statistics 2017 that are monitoring health in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \[2\] including data from between 2006 and 2015, the global under 5 mortality rate per 1000 live birth is 42.5 and is clearly highest in the African Region with 81.3 while in Kenya it is lower than the African average with 49.4. The picture is similar for maternal mortality with 216 per 100,000 live births globally but with the highest in the African region with 542 and 510 in Kenya.

The statistics also look at several WASH indicators. The mortality rate attributed to exposure to unsafe WASH services per 100,000 populations is clearly highest in the African region with a burden of 43.1, while the global burden is at 12.4, and with Kenya slightly below the African burden with 32.5. In line with this, two additional WASH indicators demonstrate the poor status in the African region. The use of improved drinking water source is lowest in the African region with 68%, while globally 91% use an improved source and in all the other WHO regions it is over 90%. Kenya is slightly below the African average with 63% using an improved drinking water source. Looking at sanitation the use of improved sanitation is lowest in the African region with only 32% and is similar at the Kenyan level with 30% while globally 68% use improved sanitation. The most recent Kenya Demographic and Health Survey in 2014 estimates that only about a third of households in Kenya have washing places at their homes \[3\]. Also, nationally, three out of four households share toilets with other households or have unimproved toilets (open defecation, open latrines, etc.). Malnutrition is specifically covered in SDG Target 2.2 (By end 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons). The WHO statistics indicate a worldwide problem with 22.9% of children under 5 years of age stunted and 7.7% wasted. While the Africa Region (33.5% and 7.4%)) together with the South-East-Asia Region (33.8% and 15.3)) have the highest stunting and wasting prevalence, respectively, the prevalence in Kenya is below the Africa average with 26.0% stunted and only 4% wasted.

Agriculture is the main source of income, food and nutrients for the majority of rural families in Sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya. Most rural families in Sub-Saharan Africa are smallholder farmers, and rely on agricultural produce for income and direct consumption. Despite the fact that these households are food producers, research has shown that rural farming households are typically net food consumers and are more vulnerable to malnutrition \[4\]. Decades of investments in the agriculture sector have focused on improving yields and income but have notably failed to improve the nutrition status of farming families and their children \[5\]. Since 2006, One Acre Fund (1AF) has been providing a bundle of services and agricultural inputs to smallholder farmers using a model where farmers take loans to pay for inputs and services received. The core service bundle includes environmentally appropriate seed and fertilizer, physical delivery of inputs, training, and small loans. 1AF currently reaches 445,000 farming households in Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi, and Uganda. Kenya was 1AF's first country of operation and their activities will soon cover all of Western and Nyanza Provinces, which are the primary food-producing regions and hold one third of Kenya's population. The most recent 1AF report impressively shows the increasing number of farm families served, the Dollar gain in farmer impact and the close to 100% farmer repayment rate of credits for seeds and fertilizers \[6\].

In partnership with the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), 1AF aims to introduce nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific components into the services offered to smallholder farmer households. The nutrition-specific interventions consist of providing MNPs (Micronutrient Powders) to children 6-59 months of age. These nutritional supplements are recommended by WHO in areas where micronutrient deficiencies and malnutrition are prevalent \[7,8\]. In order to increase protein consumption, chicken birds will be provided to households. Households will also be provided with seeds for red onion and indigenous greens. Further, children will be provided with oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc supplements as recommended by WHO and UNICEF for the treatment of acute diarrhoea \[9\]. Lastly, some WASH related interventions will also be provided, such as training sessions, soap for hand washing and chlorine for drinking water treatment.

To test the incorporation of nutrition services in 1AF's agricultural programme, pilot projects in western Kenya will be conducted between 2017 and 2020. The dietary diversity, food frequency and subsequently, a minimum acceptably dietary quality for young children are lower in the Western Province than for the national average. Further, the number of households with washing places is lower and diarrhoea prevalence is slightly higher compared to the national average \[3\].

In order to monitor and evaluate 1AF's programmes, a cluster-randomized, parallel-group, prospective, follow-up effectiveness study in children 6-35 months of age at recruitment that spans over 2 years will be conducted in the Western Province of Kenya.

Clusters will be randomly assigned to either have the regular 1AF agricultural intervention package (already in place in all clusters participating in the study and therefore called control) or the integrated intervention package that on top of the agricultural package consists of nutrition-specific (such as providing additional micronutrients) and nutrition-sensitive (such as providing soap for hand washing) interventions. The impact on malnutrition and programmatic 'success' will be evaluated.

Objective/hypothesis:

While the primary purpose is to longitudinally compare the changes of growth between the intervention and control group, the programmatic aspects such as adherence to and coverage of the intervention package and possible links to changes in dietary patterns and ultimately linear growth will also be evaluated.

As such, the research hypothesis is as follows: Linear growth in children between 6-59 months of age will improve after the provision of agricultural services, nutritionally enhanced and WASH products and diversified crops as well as nutrition and WASH training over the period of 2 years when compared to the control group provided only with agricultural services.

Study design:

The general study design is a cluster-randomized, parallel-group, prospective, follow-up effectiveness study over a period of 2 years comparing 2 groups of children 6-35 months of age at recruitment:

1. Intervention group: All selected households with children 6-35 months of age at recruitment will receive MNP (1 sachet every three days per child) and ORS along with zinc (20 mg/day) for treatment of acute diarrhoea. The households will also be provided with soap, chlorine solution, poultry (8 chickens at start of intervention), and seeds for red onion and indigenous greens (March 2018 and March 2019). The products will be accompanied by monthly nutrition and WASH trainings. The products and trainings will be provided free of charge. Additionally, all households will receive the agricultural package as in the control group.
2. Control group: All households will be provided with agricultural training (every 2 weeks on average) for free. In addition, households can also enrol for the following products on credit: compost booster, cook stoves, seeds (onions, maize, indigenous greens, beans), maize storage bags, drying tarps, trees, solar lights, fertilizer, actellic dust (insecticide), re-usable sanitary pads.

We anticipate recruiting 2,000 (1,000 in each group) children 6-35 months of age into the study. Children will be recruited from 100 clusters (randomly assigned to intervention or control) that will be drawn from Lugari district in Kakamega County located in the Western Province of Kenya.

Questionnaire based and anthropometric data will be collected in 3 rounds at a central place in walking distance from participant's homes one year apart from each other (Table 4). The following information will be collected in round 1 (baseline assessment prior to the actual start of intervention distribution):

* Age
* Height and weight
* Household demographics/characteristics and caregiver's education
* Dietary diversity, breastfeeding and infant and young children feeding (IYCF) practices
* WASH practices
* Child morbidity In rounds 2 and 3, information on dietary diversity, breastfeeding and IYCF practices, WASH practices and child morbidity will be collected again. Additionally, changes in adherence and coverage of the intervention package as well as unintended outcomes (e.g. reduction of exclusive breastfeeding due to premature introduction of complementary foods) will be assessed.

Agriculture is the main source of income, food and nutrients for the majority of rural families in Sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya. Most farmers are smallholders and are vulnerable to poor nutrition. Thus far, programmes have mostly focused on increasing yields and household income, but not on improving nutritional status. One Acre Fund (1AF) has over the past 10 years successfully introduced an agriculture programme to smallholder farmers in Western Kenya focusing on improving harvest. 1AF is therefore well placed to transform an existing and successful agriculture programme into the world's largest 'nutrition network' for farmers, and it is the hope that a partnership between Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) and 1AF will create a strong voice for nutrition within the agriculture sector. The project aims to use an integrated programme by introducing nutrition-sensitive (improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH): e.g. soap for hand washing) and nutrition-specific (e.g. micronutrient supplements) components to 1AF's agricultural programme. The impact of such an integrated programme will be assessed in a cluster-randomized intervention study in children 6-35 months at recruitment comparing one group receiving the integrated intervention to another group receiving the agricultural intervention (already in place). Background/introduction: Malnutrition, and particularly malnutrition in children under 5 years of age, remains a public health problem in many areas of the world \[1\]. A diet low in diversity and micronutrient density is one contributing factor while a second factor is poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices often leading to diseases such as persistent diarrhoea and resulting in morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years of age. According to the WHO World Health Statistics 2017 that are monitoring health in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \[2\] including data from between 2006 and 2015, the global under 5 mortality rate per 1000 live birth is 42.5 and is clearly highest in the African Region with 81.3 while in Kenya it is lower than the African average with 49.4. The picture is similar for maternal mortality with 216 per 100,000 live births globally but with the highest in the African region with 542 and 510 in Kenya. The statistics also look at several WASH indicators. The mortality rate attributed to exposure to unsafe WASH services per 100,000 populations is clearly highest in the African region with a burden of 43.1, while the global burden is at 12.4, and with Kenya slightly below the African burden with 32.5. In line with this, two additional WASH indicators demonstrate the poor status in the African region. The use of improved drinking water source is lowest in the African region with 68%, while globally 91% use an improved source and in all the other WHO regions it is over 90%. Kenya is slightly below the African average with 63% using an improved drinking water source. Looking at sanitation the use of improved sanitation is lowest in the African region with only 32% and is similar at the Kenyan level with 30% while globally 68% use improved sanitation. The most recent Kenya Demographic and Health Survey in 2014 estimates that only about a third of households in Kenya have washing places at their homes \[3\]. Also, nationally, three out of four households share toilets with other households or have unimproved toilets (open defecation, open latrines, etc.). Malnutrition is specifically covered in SDG Target 2.2 (By end 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women and older persons). The WHO statistics indicate a worldwide problem with 22.9% of children under 5 years of age stunted and 7.7% wasted. While the Africa Region (33.5% and 7.4%)) together with the South-East-Asia Region (33.8% and 15.3)) have the highest stunting and wasting prevalence, respectively, the prevalence in Kenya is below the Africa average with 26.0% stunted and only 4% wasted. Agriculture is the main source of income, food and nutrients for the majority of rural families in Sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya. Most rural families in Sub-Saharan Africa are smallholder farmers, and rely on agricultural produce for income and direct consumption. Despite the fact that these households are food producers, research has shown that rural farming households are typically net food consumers and are more vulnerable to malnutrition \[4\]. Decades of investments in the agriculture sector have focused on improving yields and income but have notably failed to improve the nutrition status of farming families and their children \[5\]. Since 2006, One Acre Fund (1AF) has been providing a bundle of services and agricultural inputs to smallholder farmers using a model where farmers take loans to pay for inputs and services received. The core service bundle includes environmentally appropriate seed and fertilizer, physical delivery of inputs, training, and small loans. 1AF currently reaches 445,000 farming households in Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi, and Uganda. Kenya was 1AF's first country of operation and their activities will soon cover all of Western and Nyanza Provinces, which are the primary food-producing regions and hold one third of Kenya's population. The most recent 1AF report impressively shows the increasing number of farm families served, the Dollar gain in farmer impact and the close to 100% farmer repayment rate of credits for seeds and fertilizers \[6\].

Far Eastern Memorial Hospital,OTHER,NCT05932784,The Impact of Aortic Valve Compression During Cardio-pulmonary Resuscitation on Patients With Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest,The Impact of Aortic Valve Compression During Cardio-pulmonary Resuscitation on Patients With Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Single-center Observational Study Using Transesophageal Echocardiography,"Purpose:

This study aims to find out if the current way of performing chest compressions during resuscitation for patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital is affecting their chances of recovery. Recent research suggests that more than half of these patients receive chest compressions near their aortic valve, which might block blood flow and make their condition worse. We will use a special imaging technique called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during resuscitation to see if compressions near the aortic valve impact patient outcomes.

Methods:

We will conduct a study with patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital and are receiving TEE during resuscitation in the emergency department. Some patients will not be included in the study, such as those who recover quickly before the TEE is done, those who need other treatments before they recover, those with an unclear compression site, or those with poor or missing TEE images. We will divide the patients into two groups: those with compressions near their aortic valve and those without. We will collect information on the patients, the TEE recordings, the resuscitation process, and important time points. We will mainly look at whether the patients recover and maintain a steady heartbeat. We will also examine other factors like their carbon dioxide levels, whether they recover at all, if they survive to be admitted to the hospital, if they survive to be discharged, and if they have good brain function when they leave the hospital. We plan to have 37 patients in each group for accurate results.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

* patients aged 20 or older who arrived at the ED with non-traumatic OHCA and underwent TEE during resuscitation

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Early ROSC before obtaining TEE image;
2. Insert the REBOA before ROSC;
3. Initiate ECMO flow before ROSC;
4. Cannot identify compression site on TEE;

Recent research suggests that more than half of these patients receive chest compressions near their aortic valve, which might block blood flow and make their condition worse. We will use a special imaging technique called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during resuscitation to see if compressions near the aortic valve impact patient outcomes. Methods: We will conduct a study with patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital and are receiving TEE during resuscitation in the emergency department. Some patients will not be included in the study, such as those who recover quickly before the TEE is done, those who need other treatments before they recover, those with an unclear compression site, or those with poor or missing TEE images. We will divide the patients into two groups: those with compressions near their aortic valve and those without. We will collect information on the patients, the TEE recordings, the resuscitation process, and important time points. We will mainly look at whether the patients recover and maintain a steady heartbeat. We will also examine other factors like their carbon dioxide levels, whether they recover at all, if they survive to be admitted to the hospital, if they survive to be discharged, and if they have good brain function when they leave the hospital. We plan to have 37 patients in each group for accurate results. Inclusion Criteria: * patients aged 20 or older who arrived at the ED with non-traumatic OHCA and underwent TEE during resuscitation Exclusion Criteria: 1. Early ROSC before obtaining TEE image; 2. Insert the REBOA before ROSC; 3. Initiate ECMO flow before ROSC; 4. Cannot identify compression site on TEE; 5. Poor quality of TEE image; 6. Missing TEE image."

The hypothesis of the study is that the use of luteal phase support with human chorionic gonadotrophin would increase the pregnancy rate in frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles.","Trial design:

-A total of 450 women undergoing FET in the Centre of Assisted Reproduction and Embryology, The University of Hong Kong-Queen Mary Hospital, will be recruited. They will be randomized into one of the following two groups by computer-generated random numbers:

Group I: luteal phase support using HCG 1500 IU intramuscular injection will be given on the day of FET and 6 days later.

Group II: normal saline (placebo) intramuscular injection will be given on the day of FET and 6 days later.

Treatment:

Ovarian stimulation protocol:

All women received ovarian stimulation according to the standard protocol of the Centre. HCG is given intramuscularly when the leading follicle reaches 18 mm in mean diameter. Oocyte retrieval is carried out 36 hours after the HCG trigger. A maximum of two embryos will transferred and any excess good quality embryos will be frozen two days after the retrieval.

FET cycle:

FET is carried out at least 2 month after the stimulated cycle if the patient fails to get pregnant in the stimulated IVF cycle and there is at least one frozen embryo. Frozen embryos after thawing are transferred in natural cycles for those women having regular ovulatory cycles, during which the patient is monitored daily for serum estradiol ad luteinising hormone levels from 18 days before the expected date of the next period.

The transfer is performed by the team clinician on the third day after the luteinising hormone surge and a maximum of two normally cleaving embryos are replaced according to our standard protocol. The luteal phase is supported as per randomization arm. Before the embryo transfer, the patient is interviewed by a designated research nurse who will explain the purpose of this study.

The aim of the proposed research is to understand how a common genetic variation in the gene for DHFR affects the function of this protein and the ability of the body to use folic acid.","A 19bp deletion polymorphism of intron 1 of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR 19bpdel) increases the risk for breast cancer, and retinoblastoma of the offspring, in folic acid supplement users. Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate present in fortified foods and supplements that must be converted to tetrahydrofolate by DHFR to enter the metabolism. Individuals homozygous for DHFR 19bpdel have higher prevalence of unmetabolized folic acid in plasma and lower incorporation of folic acid into tissues. How the DHFR19bpdel (17% homozygosity in US) affects DHFR activity and folate metabolism to increase cancer risk is not understood. Studies on this topic are urgent in the light of mandatory folic acid fortification in the US and other countries. The objective of this project is to characterize the effect of DHFR 19bpdel on DHFR activity and folate pathway reactions and to determine if the effect of DHFR 19bpdel can be alleviated with folinic acid, which is a folate source that need not be converted by DHFR. The specific aims of this project are to 1\] Determine expression of DHFR mRNA and protein, splicing of intron 1 and enzyme activity in white blood cells from 3 DHFR genotypes. 2\] Determine the effect of DHFR 19bpdel and folic acid or folinic acid concentration on cell growth, and folate pathway reactions in white blood cells in homozygotes for DHFR 19bpdel and those who lack the polymorphism. Results of this study will guide measures to reduce this modifiable cancer risk associated with DHFR 19bpdel.","Inclusion Criteria:

How the DHFR19bpdel (17% homozygosity in US) affects DHFR activity and folate metabolism to increase cancer risk is not understood. Studies on this topic are urgent in the light of mandatory folic acid fortification in the US and other countries. The objective of this project is to characterize the effect of DHFR 19bpdel on DHFR activity and folate pathway reactions and to determine if the effect of DHFR 19bpdel can be alleviated with folinic acid, which is a folate source that need not be converted by DHFR. The specific aims of this project are to 1\] Determine expression of DHFR mRNA and protein, splicing of intron 1 and enzyme activity in white blood cells from 3 DHFR genotypes. 2\] Determine the effect of DHFR 19bpdel and folic acid or folinic acid concentration on cell growth, and folate pathway reactions in white blood cells in homozygotes for DHFR 19bpdel and those who lack the polymorphism. Results of this study will guide measures to reduce this modifiable cancer risk associated with DHFR 19bpdel.

With the project proposal the aim is to identify serum markers for the characterization of steatosis in subjects affected by genetic obesity, which will most likely also be used in metabolic obesity.","Methods Study design The study includes two phases, a first exploratory phase known as ""discovery"" in which 30 subjects with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) will be analyzed with SOMAscan technology to perform a serum proteomic profile. Hepatic steatosis will be determined by the use of abdominal ultrasound in PWS subjects by establishing the control group (steatosis grade 0/1) and the steatotic one (steatosis grade 2/3). Subsequently, at least two candidate biomarkers will be selected and validated by ELISA in the 30 samples used in the discovery phase (samples already present in our serum bank) and a further 22 samples from PWS patients specifically enrolled for this study.

Patients:

30 subjects already recruited in our previous MIRNOMAPWS project (RC-2018) with genetic diagnosis of PWS, of both sexes and aged between 18 and 45 years in baseline conditions, will be taken into consideration.

For each patient, the following variables will be collected from the medical records:

* anthropometric parameters (height, weight, BMI, waist circumference);
* body composition (lean mass, fat mass), using the impedance measurement technique (BIA);
* levels of steatosis measured with ultrasound according to standard criteria
* basic metabolism, using indirect calorimetry;
* biochemical parameters determining the metabolic syndrome (HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugar);
* blood pressure;
* concomitant hormonal therapies (growth hormone therapy, sex steroids, and/or l-thyroxine).

Serum collection for proteomic analysis: the proteomic analysis will be performed on the 30 samples already available (used for the ""discovery"" phase) and on 22 new patients. Similarly to what was done for the MIRNOMAPWS project (RC-2018), fasting blood samples from new patients will be collected by standard venipuncture in BD Vacutainer® serum separation tubes (BD - Plymouth PL6 7BP, UK) and centrifuged at 1900g at 4°C for 10 min and at 16,000 g at 4°C for a further 10 minutes. The supernatants were frozen at -80°C for long-term storage.

Proteomic analysis: before the proteomic analysis the presence of hemoglobin will be evaluated by spectrophotometer Beckman Coulter® DU®730 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) using the direct spectrophotometric method of Harboe with Allen correction: Hb (g / L) = (167, 2 × A415 - 83.6 × A380 - 83.6 × A450) x 1/1000 × 1 / dilution in dH2O. The cut-off considered for serum will be 0.020 g/L.

For the proteomic characterization of serum, a new high-throughput omics technology based on the SomaLogic SOMAscan platform will be used. The system is based on the detection of SOMAmers (Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers), which are aptameric forms of DNA with high affinity and specificity for the protein target. Furthermore, these aptamers are resistant to nucleotidase activity and demonstrate higher affinity than normal antibodies. The panel used in this study will allow us to evaluate 1500 protein targets that are involved in the development of metabolic diseases, are part of the general inflammatory response, and are of interest in the study of cardiovascular diseases and oncology.

In general, the sensitivity and performance of the test are comparable to that of a normal ELISA kit, with limits for quantification around 100 fM and detection of 40 fM, and the need for only 65 µL of the sample.

Validation of candidates by ELISA: in this phase, at least two of the markers will be validated, identified in the discovery phase, which have demonstrated a significant association with the increase in steatosis in multi-parametric correlation analyses. The validation will be done by quantifying the candidates in the serum samples using specific sandwich-type commercial ELISA kits. As mentioned in the previous section, a total of 52 samples will be measured, 30 of which enrolled for the discovery phase (sera already stored) and another 22 new samples from subjects enrolled for the validation phase.","Inclusion Criteria: i. patients with a genetic diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome; ii. age range 18-45 years

Priscilla McAuliffe,OTHER,NCT02206984,Endocrine Response in Women With Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer,A Trial of Endocrine Response in Women With Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer,"RATIONALE: Currently, adjuvant endocrine therapy often follows a ""one-size-fits- all"" approach, with most premenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, and most postmenopausal receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy. In current clinical practice, patients with invasive lobular carcinoma are treated no differently than patients with invasive ductal carcinoma based on the void of information specific to patients with this tumor type. Identification of a biological signal of tamoxifen and/or AI-resistance and/or fulvestrant-sensitivity in ILC patients would have dramatic implications for the future management of this breast cancer subtype.

PURPOSE: To study whether fulvestrant is more effective than anastrozole or tamoxifen in reducing Ki67 in ILC and whether that Ki67 reduction will correlate with alterations in expression of ER and ER-regulated genes. Differential Ki67 effect in this study will serve as a surrogate for outcome of ILC patients on endocrine therapy.

Primary Objective:

To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).","OBJECTIVES

Primary

To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive, HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).

Secondary

* To evaluate ER protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate PR protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate ER-related and ILC-specific candidate gene mRNA expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in an effort to identify biomarkers of endocrine response and putative drivers of endocrine resistance in ILC.
* To evaluate associations between changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with ER and PR protein expression, or ER and candidate gene mRNA expression at baseline and post-treatment.

Exploratory

* To evaluate DNA methylation in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate associations between germline and somatic DNA sequence variants with changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
* To evaluate the activity of signaling pathways in ILC tissues by immunohistochemical or other protein analyses, such as histone modifications, at baseline and following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Histologically confirmed invasive lobular breast cancer, that is hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative, measuring at least 1 centimeter (cm) radiographically or clinically, clinical stages I-III. Invasive lobular histology will be diagnosed at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation. Subsequently, invasive lobular histology will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to patient enrollment.
* Prior to initiation of study agents, study participants will be highly encouraged to undergo a baseline research core biopsy of their breast tumor. If this is not possible or the patient refuses, the pre-treatment tumor sample must be obtained from their archival diagnostic core biopsy. If definitive surgery is not performed at day 21-27 after study treatment, a second post-treatment research core biopsy will need to be obtained from their breast tumor. For patients undergoing surgery, the second biopsy will be removed from the breast tumor tissue excised during their operation. Note: In the event that the baseline breast tumor biopsy performed for research purposes does not yield adequate tumor tissue for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, tissue will be requested from the patient's archival clinical diagnostic core biopsy if it is available.The patient will still remain on study and complete protocol therapy as planned in this unlikely event.
* Hormone receptor (HR) status of the invasive component must be documented before trial enrollment. The tumor must be HR-positive. HR will be considered positive if staining is 1% or greater for ER and/or PR. This will be determined at the enrolling institution for purposes of study participation and enrollment onto the trial. Subsequently, HR status will be confirmed by central pathology review, but this central review will not be required prior to enrolling the patient. HER2 status will be determined locally only, based upon current ASCO/CAP guidelines.
* Patients must be female.
* Participants must be fully postmenopausal.
* ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.
* Adequate organ and marrow function as defined by a history and physical exam that rules out comorbidities that would be exclusions to participation in the study (see exclusion criteria) and clinical laboratory parameters as deemed clinically appropriate by the treating physician.
* Prior use of hormone contraceptives and replacement therapy is allowed (e.g., estrogen and/or progestin), but must have been discontinued at least 30 days prior to the study enrollment. Vaginal preparations (e.g., Vagifem® or Estring®)

Researchers have identified a number of devices that can be used to reinforce the surgical repair and enhance the structure and function of both the muscles and tendons (Jo et al., 2011; Randelli, Arrigoni, Ragone, MEng, Aliprandi, Cabitza, 2011; Proctor, 2014). Reinforcement patches have been used to help improve surgical outcomes, including: allograft rotator cuff, human cadaveric skin, pig and bovine skin, equine pericardium, and porcine intestinal submucosa (Randelli, Arrigoni, Ragone, MEng, Aliprandi, Cabitza, 2011). Although synthetic patches have also shown some effectiveness, these patches do not provide biologic augmentation of the tendon repair (Jo et al., 2011).

Additionally, there has been some research examining the effectiveness of using platelet-rich plasma therapy to help repair both rotator cuff tendinopathy and tears. Platelets play an important role in the healing process and it has been theorized that exposing inflamed or healing tissue to higher densities of platelets can contribute to less pain, better range of motion (ROM), and overall healing (Pandey et al., 2016). The consensus on this type of therapy has shown inconclusive results, however. For example, research by Jo et al. (2011) found no significant change in clinical recovery in respect to pain or ROM compared to a control group. Alternatively, Pandey et al. (2016) found significant improvements in both pain and ROM scores as well as decreased re-tear rates in the plasma-rich protein treatment group. These and other similar studies utilized different methodologies for patient populations (tendinopathy versus full tears, etc.), treatment timing, formulation of platelet-rich plasma or whole blood fibrin clot, and time of follow-up. Further research is needed to identify what treatments, if any, in the field of platelet-rich plasma are most beneficial for patients with rotator cuff tears. Recent research has demonstrated that whole blood fibrin clots concentrate 98% of available platelets and release growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor over two weeks (Siegel, Clevenger, Proctor, Clegg, \& Proctor, 2017). However, clinical evidence indicating the effect of whole blood fibrin clots on the healing of repaired torn rotator cuffs is lacking (Jo et al., 2011).

People with hypochondriasis believe that real or imagined physical symptoms are signs of serious illnesses, despite medical reassurance and other evidence to the contrary. Symptoms of the disorder include a preoccupation with fear of an illness; a persistent fear of having a serious illness, despite medical reassurance; and misinterpretation of symptoms. Some individuals with hypochondriasis recognize that their fear of having a serious illness may be excessive, unreasonable, or unfounded.

Particularly, LSD attenuated anxiety in patients with cancer. Clinical research with LSD ended in the 1970s due to regulatory restrictions but its use for personal and recreational purposes continued. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the use hallucinogens in psychiatric research and practices. LSD and psilocybin were reused in experimental studies in healthy subjects and in the treatment for anxiety in patients with life-threatening diseases. Specifically, a pilot study documented that LSD can be used safely and may reduce anxiety in these patients. Larger well-designed and placebo-controlled studies are warranted. Similar studies have recently been completed with the hallucinogen psilocybin.

Objective: To test the efficacy of LSD in patients with anxiety with or without life-threatening diseases.

Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled random-order cross-over trial using two LSD (200 µg) and two placebo sessions with subjects acting as their own control.

Participants: 40 patients aged \> 25 years with anxiety disorder (according to DSM-IV or a state-trait anxiety inventory score \>40 in the STAI trait or state scale) with or without life-threatening illness.

Main outcome measures: Reduction in anxiety (STAI), depression (Hamilton depression rating scale, HDRS and Beck depression inventory, BDI), and general psychopathological symptoms (Symptom Check List 90 items, SCL-90) at 2, 8, and 16 weeks after LSD- compared with placebo-assisted psychotherapy.

1. Age \> 25 years.
2. Meet DSM-IV criteria for anxiety disorder as indicated by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (SCID)-IV or have a score of at least 40 on the state- or trait STAI scale at study inclusion.
3. 40% or more of the participants should have a diagnosis of advanced-stage potentially fatal illness (autoimmune, neurological, or cancer without central nervous system (CNS) involvement). Patients should be ambulatory and not terminal and likely to have a roughly estimated life expectancy of \> twelve months.
4. Patients without advanced-stage potentially fatal illness need to meet DSM-IV criteria for anxiety disorder (elevated STAI score not sufficient for inclusion)
5. Sufficient understanding of the study procedures and risks associated with the study.
6. Participants must be willing to adhere to the study procedures and sign the consent form.
7. Participants are willing to refrain from taking any psychiatric medications during the experimental session period.

Substitution of the first anti-androgen and anti-androgen withdrawal results in treatment responses in 25-40% of patients for 4-6 months. A more effective second line treatment after failure of first ADT could prolong the time until the state of symptomatic HRPC, which is currently treated with docetaxel and accompanied by significant side effects. Since the importance of the IGF-signaling in PC is not only indicated by preclinical results but also by clinical efficacy of somatostatin analogs, further clinical research with the new somatostatin analog pasireotide is warranted.

The prevalence rate in England is reported to be between 1-2.4%. OLP contributed to around 40% of all visits or 1,200 appointments in 2014 at the Eastman Dental Hospital. Pain, discomfort, long-standing use of medications, lesion recurrence and adverse side effects of therapy are commonly associated with OLP, eventually leading to a significant reduction in a patient quality of life. In addition, there is also increased risk of developing oral cancer in patients with OLP. The current gold standard treatment for OLP is corticosteroid, which can result in adverse side effects including increased risk of infections and skin cancer, reduced systemic immune system, and hepatotoxicity with long-term usage.

Alternatively, a probiotic food supplement, VSL#3, has shown evidence of been able to induce and maintain remission in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), with no adverse effect a part than bloating, reported. Additionally, a preliminary report shown that probiotics treatment in Behcet's disease and Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) lesion resulted in reducing the number of oral ulcerations and subjective relief of oral discomfort.

A randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial study on individuals with OLP.

Patients with painful ulcerative biopsy-confirmed OLP attending the Oral Medicine clinics of the UCLH ( University college of London hospital) Eastman Hospital and meeting the inclusion criteria of the study will be given information about the trial and invited to participate.

30 individuals who consent will be recruited and randomised in two groups: group A (15 participants) will receive the VSL#3 and group B (15 participants) will receive a placebo. A centralised computer-generated randomization list provided by an independent third party will be used to conceal allocation of patients to the treatments. The list will be sent to the drug manufacturer who will label the VSL#3 or placebo with relevant study participant code, which will come in the same identical plain-packages to ensure blinding (neither the participants nor the investigator will be aware of the sachets content). The study statistician will also be blinded to the allocation. Patients will be allowed to use best standard therapy during the study.

To demonstrate the research hypotheses, Investigators will record oral painful symptoms, disease activity, and quality of life in participants before, at 15 and 30 days from treatment start, and 30 days (day 60) after the last VSL#3 supplement intake.

The prevalence rate in England is reported to be between 1-2.4%. OLP contributed to around 40% of all visits or 1,200 appointments in 2014 at the Eastman Dental Hospital. Pain, discomfort, long-standing use of medications, lesion recurrence and adverse side effects of therapy are commonly associated with OLP, eventually leading to a significant reduction in a patient quality of life. In addition, there is also increased risk of developing oral cancer in patients with OLP. The current gold standard treatment for OLP is corticosteroid, which can result in adverse side effects including increased risk of infections and skin cancer, reduced systemic immune system, and hepatotoxicity with long-term usage. Alternatively, a probiotic food supplement, VSL#3, has shown evidence of been able to induce and maintain remission in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), with no adverse effect a part than bloating, reported.

McMaster University,OTHER,NCT05549479,Virtual Peer-support Exercise Intervention for Older Adults with Cancer,A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of a Virtual Peer-support Exercise Intervention for Older Adults with Cancer,"Background:

By 2030, 23% of Canadians will be over 65 years of age. Two in five of these individuals will be diagnosed with cancer. Older adults have high levels of functional decline, and a cancer diagnosis adds prolonged physical sequelae to the natural aging process. Many of these effects can be mitigated by regular exercise. However, older adult cancer survivors are significantly less likely to meet current exercise guidelines than their younger counterparts. As our population ages, we need to develop effective, scalable interventions that support health in older adult cancer survivors. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a virtually delivered peer exercise intervention with qualified exercise professional (QEP) support for older adult cancer survivors.

Methods:

Participants will include older adult cancer survivors who are cleared for exercise, have consistent access to the internet, and currently take part in less than 150 minutes of exercise per week. All participants will be matched with a partner, given a peer support guide, and information on current exercise guidelines. In addition to being matched with a peer, dyads in the intervention group will have weekly virtual sessions with a QEP for 10 weeks. Participants in the control group will independently support their partner around exercise for 10 weeks.

Outcomes:

Participants will be assessed at 3 time points. The primary outcome is feasibility. This will be measured by assessing recruitment, retention, adherence rates to the intervention, and participant acceptability and satisfaction. Secondary effectiveness outcomes include exercise volume, social support, quality of life, physical function, and physical activity enjoyment.

Impact:

If effective, this will be the first virtual peer-based exercise intervention for older adult cancer survivors. Findings will inform future methods aimed at increasing exercise in older adults.","METHODS

Research Questions:

Research Question 1 (primary). Is a virtually-delivered, peer matching exercise intervention supported by qualified exercise professionals (QEP) feasible for older adult cancer survivors? Research Question 2. Do older adult cancer survivors who participate in a virtually-delivered peer matching exercise intervention with QEP support have improved levels of social support compared to those matched with a peer only? Research Question 3. Do older adult cancer survivors who participate in a virtually-delivered peer matching exercise intervention with QEP support have improved levels of physical activity behaviour, health-related quality of life and physical functioning compared to those who are matched with a peer only?

Study Design:

This is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment. The protocol and study methods adhere to the CONSORT extension for randomized pilot trials. The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board will approve this study. Dyads will be randomized (1:1) to the Intervention (AgeMatchPLUS) or control (AgeMatch) groups prior to baseline assessment. Group allocation will be centrally randomized using a web platform (https://www.randomizer.org/) by a graduate student external to the research team. A Research Assistant will assign group allocation in the order participants complete an initial demographics questionnaire and are matched with a peer for the study.

Intervention:

Peer Matching. A Research Assistant will match all participants into dyads based on evidence-informed criteria. To be matched, females must be in the same time zone and diagnosed with the same type of cancer. Matched peers will be introduced to each other by a Research Assistant via zoom after baseline data collection. All participants will be given a peer support guide that provides tips for supporting their exercise partner, an infographic on exercise guidelines for older cancer survivors and a Fitbit Inspire 2©. Partners will independently communicate and support each other around exercise for the duration of the study.

Intervention Group (AgeMatchPLUS). This group will have dyads participate in weekly virtual sessions with a QEP for 10 weeks. Each session will last up to 1 hour. The QEP (i.e., registered kinesiologist) will provide a tailored exercise program, focusing on aerobic activity with both participants in the dyad based on personal circumstances, cancer-related characteristics, side effects, current fitness level, and personal preferences. Overall, content discussed at the sessions will include a review of the exercise program, barriers to exercise participation, achievement of goals, and adverse events. For four weeks following the 10-week intervention, the QEP will be available for consultation (labelled ""tapering"" period) as needed by participants in this group. This tapering period is important to understand strategies to successfully taper older adults from an exercise trial. Also, during the tapering period, participants in this group will receive two supportive emails from the QEP encouraging ongoing maintenance of exercise and social support.

Control Condition (AgeMatch): Dyads in this group will independently communicate and support each other around exercise for 10 weeks. They will not have contact with the QEP during the intervention or tapering period and will structure their communication (mode and frequency) with their matched peer.","Inclusion Criteria:

Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,OTHER,NCT04552379,The Containing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) Trial,A Cluster Randomised Trial of Interferon Versus Standard of Care in the Reduction of Transmission of SARS-Cov-2. The Containing Coronavirus Disease 19 Trial (ConCorD-19),"In recent months severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a novel human pathogen and, susceptibility amongst humans is presumed to be universal. Prevention measures of COVID-19 have included distancing, quarantines, use of facemasks in public places, and hand hygiene measures. Mandatory quarantines have also been applied on index cases and their contacts, as well as an active search for asymptomatic patients.

Current strategies to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 do not include measures that could prevent transmission prior to the onset of symptoms. Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been known to shed virus and be contagious for up to 5 days prior to developing symptoms ('pre-symptomatic transmission'). In fact, nearly 60% of all infected subjects can shed virus pre-symptomatically. Pre- or even asymptomatic shedding occurs across all age groups, contributing to the rapidly expanding pandemic.

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) using type 1 interferon (IFN) can potentially eliminate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. IFN could reduce the period of viral shedding by \~1 week. Since pre-symptomatic shedding of virus can start up to 5 days prior to symptom onset, our approach of a PEP intervention to all contacts recently exposed to a case could possibly entirely interrupt the spread of the virus, and with that, the pandemic. The current study focuses on prevention of the disease in addition to its treatment. Thus, the key distinction between these other trials and this study is that this study focuses on containing coronavirus (i.e. cause) in the community, rather than simply its treatment (i.e. consequence) in the individual.

Viral spread could be eliminated through interventions effective at abolishing viral transmission. However, such post-exposure prophylaxis interventions, that is initiation of antiviral therapy in pre-infectious contacts to reduce or even eliminate such spread, must be safe since they are given to asymptomatic and possibly uninfected subjects. In none of the previous clinical trials of IFN therapy for SARS-CoV-2 have serious adverse events been recorded. Furthermore, the IFN chosen for this study (pegylated IFN 1b) has been extensively studied in clinical trials, and has been in clinical use for years for multiple sclerosis. Pegylated IFN formulations allow for weekly injections while maintaining serum levels and limiting dose-dependent side effects. Together these data support a sound safety profile for the planned intervention.

The aim of this study is to ascertain whether IFN administered to index cases and household contacts of an index case, starting immediately following confirmed exposure (index case confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2), will reduce duration of SARS-CoV-2 detectable by PCR in the index cases, and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 detectable by PCR in household contacts.","Participants with COVID-19 will be identified from lists of patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR that is obtained daily from clinical laboratories, at COVID-19 outpatient and hospital clinics, or the Emergency Rooms in Chile. After telephonically pre-screening eligibility of the index case and his/her household, and participants providing informed consent, households will be randomized 1:1 to three doses of IFN beta 1a or standard of care. Only the index case and treatment-eligible household members will receive IFN if their household is assigned to treatment arm. Other non-eligible household participants (e.g. children) will be monitored by serial SARS-CoV-2 saliva PCR and diary cards, and at day 29 all participants will be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood.","Inclusion Criteria:

Ain Shams University,OTHER,NCT01679379,Wound Infection in Obese Women After Cesarean Delivery,Surgical Site Infection in Obese Women After Cesarean Section; A Randomized Controlled Trial of Absorbable Versus Non Absorbable Sutures for Skin Closure.,The purpose of this study is to determine the surgical site infection rate and patient satisfaction for absorbable versus non absorbable suture in closure of skin at cesarean section in obese women.,"Cesarean section (CS) is the commonest major operation performed on women in the world. Approximately one in 4 women in the United States is delivered by cesarean section, and it is well established that operative abdominal delivery is associated with a significant risk of infection compared with vaginal delivery. These risks are increased with preexisting operative site infection, breaks in sterile technique, prolonged preoperative admissions that may result in colonization with resistant microbes, prolonged operative duration, use of electrocautery, obesity, advanced age, inadequate host immunocompetence.

Obese women may have increased susceptibility to infections because of the effects of obesity on the immune system, skin barriers, wound healing, mobility, and coexisting chronic diseases including diabetes, which could increase infection risk by itself. Cohort studies have shown that women with a body mass index (BMI)\>30kg/m\^2 have a two to three folds increased risk of post cesarean infections, such as wound infection, urinary tract infection UTI), endometritis, or pneumonia, compared with non-obese women. Other studies found that obesity doubled the risk specifically for post-cesarean wound infection.

Wound complications are a major source of morbidity after CS and contribute to prolonged hospital stay and rates of readmission. Age, (BMI), length of incision, and timing of prophylactic antibiotic administration have all been associated with post cesarean surgical site infection (SSI).

A surgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place. SSI can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs, or implanted material. SSI has a great impact on the economy and health care resources. Infection has always been a feature of modern surgery and continues to be a significant problem for health care practitioners across the world.

The ideal skin closure would be safe and effective, associated with minimal patient discomfort, and have a good cosmetic result. It would also be inexpensive and require fewer health care resources by being fast and easy to apply, require minimal follow-up evaluation, and be associated with a low rate of complications.

Methods for closing the skin at the time of cesarean delivery include stainless steel staples, subcuticular absorbable staples, subcuticular suture, adhesive closure strips, and tissue adhesives (cyanoacrylates). Each of the methods has its postulated benefits for wound outcomes; however, none of these have been compared in a prospective trial.

The role of skin closure suture material on wound complication rates in Obstetrics is poorly studied. And when we are talking about obese patients we did not find any recommendation regarding the suture material of skin closure although most of Obstetricians use different sutures materials.

Does closure of skin by absorbable compared to non absorbable suture affect the rate of surgical site infection in obese patients undergoing caesarian section? Our hypothesis is that no difference between absorbable compared to non absorbable suture.","Inclusion Criteria:

Medical University of South Carolina,OTHER,NCT00706979,A Novel Treatment to Boost Quit Attempts and Cessation Among Unmotivated Smokers,A Novel Treatment to Boost Quit Attempts and Cessation Among Unmotivated Smokers,"A sample of smokers who have no current plans to quit will be recruited for this study and randomized to one of two intervention conditions:

1. Practice Quit Attempt (PQA) aided by brief advice and self-help materials, or
2. PQA aided by advice and self-help materials plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).

This study will test whether adding free nicotine replacement therapy to brief advice to undertake a practice quit attempt will motivate more smokers to make a serious attempt to stop smoking than brief advice without NRT. All treatments and assessments will be delivered via telephone and mailing. The primary outcome of interest is the incidence of a serious attempt to permanently stop smoking made over a six-month study period.

Our specific hypotheses are as follows:

Hypothesis 1: Helping smokers to make a practice quit attempt aided by NRT will result in a higher incidence of making a serious effort to quit smoking permanently, compared to an aided practice quit attempt without NRT. We also expect provision of NRT will increase point prevalence abstinence at 6 month follow-up.

Hypothesis 2: This relationship between NRT-aided practice quit attempts and quit behaviors will be mediated by a) increased smoking related self efficacy, b) increased belief in the efficacy of NRT, c) fewer concerns about adverse events of NRT, d) increased social support for not smoking, and e) less withdrawal distress and craving during the practice quit attempt.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

ICH is a dynamic process with three phases: initial hemorrhage, followed by hematoma expansion and perihematoma edema formation. Hematoma volume is correlated with disease progression and outcome. Contemporary evidence proposes that elevated blood pressure is associated with hematoma expansion while more than 90% of patients with ICH present with acute hypertension. Uncontrolled blood pressure is a leading cause of ICH and it seems also to be a factor of poorer outcomes. Therefore, rapid reduction and control of blood pressure might ease disease progression and improve the outcome. Clevidipine (Cleviprex®), an ultrashort-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, with its rapid onset and short duration might be more effective than conventional antihypertensives to achieve rapid blood pressure control in patients with acute ICH.","After admission to the ICU the patients presenting with primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are evaluated for enrollment. If systolic blood pressure (SBP) is higher than 160 mmHg or SBP \<160 mmHg under intravenous antihypertensive drug (e.g. Urapidil), started less than 3 h before randomization, the patient will be randomized in one of the two study groups and intravenous therapy with Clevidipine (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®) will start immediately. Data of systemic haemodynamics will be collected continuously by online monitoring, starting at baseline and ending after 24h (study data measurements). In particular, all blood pressure measurements are extracted via an arterial line, which is placed as standard of care in these patients. If the target values are not attained within 30 minutes, the investigators can add or switch to alternative antihypertensive drugs of their choice. 24h after initiation of Clevidipine (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®), all patients receive Nicardipine (Cardene®) (standard care in daily clinical routine) for another 24h followed by orally administered antihypertensive medication.

A Three-phased Cross-over Study.,"The circadian rhythm, the sleep-wake cycle, is mainly regulated by melatonin. The synthesis of melatonin is stimulated by the absence of light, leading to peak serum levels before bedtime. In humans, this endogenous ""signaling"" neurohormone induces sleep. Exogenous melatonin can be beneficial in different sleep disturbances including delayed sleep phase insomnia, melatonin- deficiency-related insomnia (especially in elderly) and shift work sleep disorder. Melatonin is known for its low and variable bioavailability in humans due to a high first pass effect and variable pharmacokinetics and short half-life. In order to prevent exposure of patients with unnecessary high dosages of melatonin and in order to achieve a short Tmax and high bio-availability of melatonin, a proper formulation needs to be defined. This study, a three-phased cross-over study, aims to define a proper formulation for oral and oromucosal melatonin for the treatment of insomnia by investigating the Tmax and relative bioavailability derived from melatonin levels in salivary samples of healthy volunteers after administration of melatonin in different formulations: 2,5mg melatonin immediate release capsule (produced by Apotheek UMCU), 1mg melatonin immediate release tablet (produced by Tiofarma), low-dose 0.1mg melatonin original Sleepzz tablet (produced by Vemedia Manufacturing BV).","The circadian rhythm, the sleep-wake cycle, is mainly regulated by melatonin. The synthesis of melatonin is stimulated by the absence of light, leading to peak serum levels before bedtime. In humans, this endogenous ""signaling"" neurohormone induces sleep.

Exogenous melatonin can be beneficial in different sleep disturbances including delayed sleep phase insomnia (Dahlitz et al. 1991, Regestein et al. 1995), melatonin- deficiency-related insomnia (especially in elderly) (Garfinkel 1995, Etzioni et al. 1995) and shift work sleep disorder (Folkard et al. 1993, Skene et al. 1996).

A randomized controlled trial of van Geijlswijk et al. (van Geijlswijk 2010) showed that no relationship could be demonstrated between melatonin dose (0.05-0.15 mg/kg) and shift of sleep onset time (SOT), shortening of sleep onset latency (SOL) and shift of dim light melatonin (DLMO). On the other hand, the timing of melatonin administration did have a clinically and statistically significant effect on all three parameters. Timing of melatonin administration in relation to baseline DLMO determines the phase advance, as can be measured by the shift of DLMO and SOT to an earlier time in the evening, resulting also in a shorter SOL. Melatonin must be administered in a closely defined time-slot before endogenous DLMO and before bedtime. The phase advance occurs when melatonin is administered 1-2 hours before DLMO and bedtime (van Geijlswijk et al. 2010). This trial demonstrated that low dosage of melatonin (0.05mg/kg) is effective in children when given at least 1-2 hours before the individual DLMO and the desired bedtime. This means that the release of melatonin from any pharmaceutical formulation should occur fast enough in order to achieve predictive high levels within the desired time-slot before the occurrence of (baseline) DLMO to induce a phase advance. These high maximum serum levels shortly after administration (Tmax) means the release rate of melatonin from the formulation needs to be as fast as possible and the bioavailability needs to be as high as possible.

Melatonin is known for its low and variable bioavailability in humans due to a high first pass effect and variable pharmacokinetics and short half-life. In order to prevent exposure of patients with unnecessary high dosages of melatonin and in order to achieve a short Tmax and high bio-availability of melatonin, a proper formulation needs to be defined. Thereby, the bioavailability must be made less variable in order to understand the biologic effects of melatonin (Di 1997).

Aim/objective. This study, a three-phased cross-over study, aims to define a proper formulation for oral and oromucosal melatonin for the treatment of insomnia by investigating the Tmax and relative bioavailability derived from melatonin levels in salivary samples of healthy volunteers after administration of melatonin in different formulations: 2,5mg melatonin immediate release capsule (produced by Apotheek UMCU), 1mg melatonin immediate release tablet (produced by Tiofarma), low-dose 0.1mg melatonin original Sleepzz tablet (produced by Vemedia Manufacturing BV).

Study-design. Three-phased cross-overstudy. Study-population. The study population will consist of 10 healthy volunteers (male) aged 18 to 35 years old without insomnia. They will be recruited in the Netherlands. Intervention. The intervention starts between 10:00 and 11:00 am when the participant flushes his mouth with water, waits 15 minutes and starts to chew on a cotton plug during 1 minute. Directly after that the participant will administer one of the IMP's according to the instructions. The tablet and capsule will be swallowed. The sublingual tablet will be administered sublingual. 10 minutes after administration the subjects will drink one glass of water and subsequently try to swallow as much liquid (including saliva), in order to prevent contamination of the saliva sample with the remaining exogenous melatonin. At 15 minutes, 30 min, 1 hour, 1.5 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after oral administration the participant will chew on new cotton plugs during 1 minute. After administration of the sublingual tablet saliva samples will be collected at 25 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 minutes, 1.5 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after sublingual administration. 15 minutes before each sampling the subject will flush his mouth with water. The cotton plugs with salivary will be preserved in a test-tube in the freezer and will be analyzed by Ziekenhuis Gelderse Vallei.

Main study endpoint: the Tmax and relative bioavailability of oral and oromucosal melatonin derived from melatonin levels in salivary samples of healthy volunteers.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

This study will burden the participants in a small extent. As mentioned before, melatonin is well tolerated and is not reported to have a hangover effect. Its rarely occurring side effects include fatigue, dizziness, nausea, mild drowsiness, hypothermia and headache (Wagner 1998, Waldhauser 1990, Dahlitz 1991, Garfinkel 1995, Dollins 1994). Besides that, the participants will be asked to perform simple actions during 3 intervention days for only 3 hours.

The low dose 0.1mg melatonin original Sleepzz table is available without prescription in drugstores in the Netherlands. The tablet will also contain low dosage of melatonin, respectively 1mg and the capsule will contain regular dose of melatonin (2,5mg). These dosages are safe for adults and children. A few reports have been published on the consequences of long-term treatment with melatonin in humans. (Severe) adverse events were not described in these reports.

Melatonin is known for its low and variable bioavailability in humans due to a high first pass effect and variable pharmacokinetics and short half-life. In order to prevent exposure of patients with unnecessary high dosages of melatonin and in order to achieve a short Tmax and high bio-availability of melatonin, a proper formulation needs to be defined. This study, a three-phased cross-over study, aims to define a proper formulation for oral and oromucosal melatonin for the treatment of insomnia by investigating the Tmax and relative bioavailability derived from melatonin levels in salivary samples of healthy volunteers after administration of melatonin in different formulations: 2,5mg melatonin immediate release capsule (produced by Apotheek UMCU), 1mg melatonin immediate release tablet (produced by Tiofarma), low-dose 0.1mg melatonin original Sleepzz tablet (produced by Vemedia Manufacturing BV). The circadian rhythm, the sleep-wake cycle, is mainly regulated by melatonin. The synthesis of melatonin is stimulated by the absence of light, leading to peak serum levels before bedtime. In humans, this endogenous ""signaling"" neurohormone induces sleep. Exogenous melatonin can be beneficial in different sleep disturbances including delayed sleep phase insomnia (Dahlitz et al. 1991, Regestein et al. 1995), melatonin- deficiency-related insomnia (especially in elderly) (Garfinkel 1995, Etzioni et al. 1995) and shift work sleep disorder (Folkard et al. 1993, Skene et al. 1996). A randomized controlled trial of van Geijlswijk et al. (van Geijlswijk 2010) showed that no relationship could be demonstrated between melatonin dose (0.05-0.15 mg/kg) and shift of sleep onset time (SOT), shortening of sleep onset latency (SOL) and shift of dim light melatonin (DLMO). On the other hand, the timing of melatonin administration did have a clinically and statistically significant effect on all three parameters. Timing of melatonin administration in relation to baseline DLMO determines the phase advance, as can be measured by the shift of DLMO and SOT to an earlier time in the evening, resulting also in a shorter SOL. Melatonin must be administered in a closely defined time-slot before endogenous DLMO and before bedtime. The phase advance occurs when melatonin is administered 1-2 hours before DLMO and bedtime (van Geijlswijk et al. 2010). This trial demonstrated that low dosage of melatonin (0.05mg/kg) is effective in children when given at least 1-2 hours before the individual DLMO and the desired bedtime. This means that the release of melatonin from any pharmaceutical formulation should occur fast enough in order to achieve predictive high levels within the desired time-slot before the occurrence of (baseline) DLMO to induce a phase advance. These high maximum serum levels shortly after administration (Tmax) means the release rate of melatonin from the formulation needs to be as fast as possible and the bioavailability needs to be as high as possible. Melatonin is known for its low and variable bioavailability in humans due to a high first pass effect and variable pharmacokinetics and short half-life. In order to prevent exposure of patients with unnecessary high dosages of melatonin and in order to achieve a short Tmax and high bio-availability of melatonin, a proper formulation needs to be defined. Thereby, the bioavailability must be made less variable in order to understand the biologic effects of melatonin (Di 1997). Aim/objective. This study, a three-phased cross-over study, aims to define a proper formulation for oral and oromucosal melatonin for the treatment of insomnia by investigating the Tmax and relative bioavailability derived from melatonin levels in salivary samples of healthy volunteers after administration of melatonin in different formulations: 2,5mg melatonin immediate release capsule (produced by Apotheek UMCU), 1mg melatonin immediate release tablet (produced by Tiofarma), low-dose 0.1mg melatonin original Sleepzz tablet (produced by Vemedia Manufacturing BV). Study-design. Three-phased cross-overstudy. Study-population. The study population will consist of 10 healthy volunteers (male) aged 18 to 35 years old without insomnia. They will be recruited in the Netherlands. Intervention. The intervention starts between 10:00 and 11:00 am when the participant flushes his mouth with water, waits 15 minutes and starts to chew on a cotton plug during 1 minute. Directly after that the participant will administer one of the IMP's according to the instructions. The tablet and capsule will be swallowed. The sublingual tablet will be administered sublingual. 10 minutes after administration the subjects will drink one glass of water and subsequently try to swallow as much liquid (including saliva), in order to prevent contamination of the saliva sample with the remaining exogenous melatonin. At 15 minutes, 30 min, 1 hour, 1.5 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after oral administration the participant will chew on new cotton plugs during 1 minute. After administration of the sublingual tablet saliva samples will be collected at 25 minutes, 40 minutes, 60 minutes, 1.5 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after sublingual administration. 15 minutes before each sampling the subject will flush his mouth with water. The cotton plugs with salivary will be preserved in a test-tube in the freezer and will be analyzed by Ziekenhuis Gelderse Vallei. Main study endpoint: the Tmax and relative bioavailability of oral and oromucosal melatonin derived from melatonin levels in salivary samples of healthy volunteers. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: This study will burden the participants in a small extent. As mentioned before, melatonin is well tolerated and is not reported to have a hangover effect. Its rarely occurring side effects include fatigue, dizziness, nausea, mild drowsiness, hypothermia and headache (Wagner 1998, Waldhauser 1990, Dahlitz 1991, Garfinkel 1995, Dollins 1994). Besides that, the participants will be asked to perform simple actions during 3 intervention days for only 3 hours. The low dose 0.1mg melatonin original Sleepzz table is available without prescription in drugstores in the Netherlands. The tablet will also contain low dosage of melatonin, respectively 1mg and the capsule will contain regular dose of melatonin (2,5mg). These dosages are safe for adults and children. A few reports have been published on the consequences of long-term treatment with melatonin in humans. (Severe) adverse events were not described in these reports. (Van Geijlswijk 2011, Jan et al. 1996, Jan et al. 1994, Gilberg et al. 1997, Smits et al. 2001, Arendt 2000). Inclusion Criteria: * Volunteers (male) aged from 18 to 35 years old without insomnia.

Rhode Island Hospital,OTHER,NCT00183079,Reducing Alcohol Use in Depressed Patients,Brief Alcohol Intervention With Depressed Patients,The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief alcohol intervention reduces alcohol use and improves depression among depressed patients.,"Heavy alcohol consumption is common among patients seeking treatment for depression. Heavy drinking is associated with a variety of medical and psychosocial problems. Heavy drinking is particularly problematic among depressed patients, increasing the likelihood of poor depression treatment outcomes. While methods for reducing alcohol use in this population have been unexplored to date, brief interventions to reduce heavy alcohol use have been well-validated in numerous patient populations and offer the promise to reduce heavy drinking among depressed patients and to improve depression treatment outcomes.

We hypothesize that adding a brief alcohol intervention to standard psychiatric care, relative to standard psychiatric care alone, will reduce overall drinking volume and heavy drinking days among heavy-drinking depressed patients. Furthermore, we expect patients who receive the brief alcohol intervention to have better depression outcomes than patients receiving standard psychiatric care alone. We also expect that reduced alcohol consumption will mediate the effect of the brief alcohol intervention on depression outcomes. In addition, we will examine individual difference variables as predictors of change in alcohol use.

The proposed study is a randomized, two-group design with repeated measures over time, comparing a brief, motivationally-focused alcohol intervention plus standard psychiatric care to standard psychiatric care alone. For this study, we will recruit a sample of 240 psychiatry clinic outpatients meeting structured diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder who drink heavily but are not alcohol dependent.

We expect that the results of this study will improve depression treatment outcomes for the significant subpopulation of depression patients who drink heavily and are likely to do poorly in depression treatment in the absence of a change in their drinking behavior. The intervention proposed in this study represents a novel approach to reducing heavy drinking among depressed patients that, if effective, can be readily integrated into depression treatment in a variety of treatment settings.

Yonsei University,OTHER,NCT01145079,A New Strategy Regarding Discontinuation of Dual Antiplatelet,A New Strategy Regarding Discontinuation of Dual Antiplatelet; Real Safety and Efficacy of a 3-month Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Following Zotarolimus-eluting Stents Implantation (RESET Trial),"Drug-eluting stents (DES), markedly reducing the neointimal hyperplasia after stent implantation compared with bare-metal stents (BMS), have improved angiographic and clinical outcomes in the complex lesions and patients with high risks. However, currently, the fatal events related with stent thrombosis still occur and are the major limitation of the use of DES. Especially, late or very late thrombosis after DES implantation is an uncommon but life-threatening fatal complication presented with sudden death or myocardial infarction (MI) causing heart failure. The most powerful predictor for stent thrombosis is the discontinuation of clopidogrel. In consideration of current data regarding stent thrombosis and clinical situation of discontinuation of antiplatelet, zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES) \[Endeavor®, Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA\] might be anticipated to be safer than other DES during the long-term follow-up owing to healthy endothelialization. Endeavor® stent was consists of zotarolimus, thin-strut, cobalt-chromium alloy stent platform (DriverTM stent; Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA), and phosphorylcholine coating. The ENDEAVOR II study demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvement in all of study endpoints, including a 47 percent reduction in the primary endpoint of target vessel failure (TVF). In addition, the ENDEAVOR II trial showed a 0.5 percent rate of stent thrombosis at 30 days - with no late thrombosis beyond 30 days and no late stent malapposition. Because reendothelialization after ZES implantation may occur within 3 months, 3-month dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended in many clinical trials and real world practice. Shorter maintenance of dual antiplatelet therapy might minimize the risk for stent thrombosis in cases of discontinuation of antiplatelet and prevent waste medications and bleeding complications related with dual antiplatelet therapy. However, there have been no non-inferior or superior data of ZES considering all these circumstances. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that ZES with 3-month dual antiplatelet therapy may be safe and beneficial in patients with coronary artery disease during follow-up than other DES, in spite of higher late lumen loss. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will perform a multi-center, randomized, prospective trial aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of the ZES versus other DES in patients with coronary artery disease in real world practice.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Key innovative components in the STAND intervention address previously reported treatment barriers: 1) a parent-delivered academic intervention to promote maintenance and generalization across school years, and to relieve some of the burden of intervention delivery from teachers, 2) motivational interviewing to address parent disengagement from and adolescent resistance to the treatment process, 3) multiple tailored options for home-school communication, including a web-based support system, to facilitate home-school communication, and 4) empowering parents by coaching them to effectively and tactfully involve teachers in the treatment planning and monitoring process in order to increase teachers' willingness to support the child's academic needs. To study the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the STAND treatment model,\] two cohorts of 42 middle school students with ADHD will be recruited (total N=84) and randomly assigned to participate in STAND or a treatment-as-usual monitoring group. All participants will complete intake, mid-treatment, post-treatment, \[and follow-up\] assessments designed to monitor academic functioning, \[intervention feasibility, compliance, and satisfaction\].

Aim 1: The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy, \[maintenance, and cross-school year generalization\] of a parent-teen-teacher collaborative intervention (Supporting Teens' Academic Needs Daily; STAND) vs. treatment as usual to increase the academic functioning of middle school students with ADHD. Intervention effects on ADHD symptomatology and impairment, grade-point-average (GPA), \[organization, daily planner use\], homework completion, teacher ratings of academic functioning and classroom behavior, and the parent-teen relationship will be examined.

Aim 2: The proposed study will examine the acceptability and feasibility of the STAND program.

Data will be included from previous cohort studies from four countries: United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Denmark, and France.","This is a retrospective non-interventional cohort study of women with sPPH who were treated with NovoSeven® or other standard of care. The analyses will be done utilising data that were collected for other purposes in four countries. The data include four previously established cohorts from the UK, France, Denmark and The Netherlands. In short, these population-based studies collected data, using enhanced systems, from the medical records of the women who met the case definition for each of the respective studies. Data are available from approximately 1260 (Netherlands, 39 exposed to NovoSeven®), 1655 (France, 18 exposed to NovoSeven®), 245 (DK, 28 exposed to NovoSeven®) and 162 (UK, 13 exposed to NovoSeven®) patients with persistent PPH.

Information regarding patient characteristics, concomitant treatment and outcomes in PPH women treated with NovoSeven® is limited in many countries. The current study will therefore include a description of women with PPH treated with NovoSeven®, or standard of care in each of the four cohorts. This will also include an assessment of the comparability of the cohorts and the overall rate of clinical outcomes in the study population. To aid in this assessment propensity scores will be calculated and used to match the women with an event of sPPH treated with NovoSeven® and those that are not.

The UK and Danish datasets were national and the datasets from Netherlands, and France were from multiple regions. The TeMpOH-1 study in the Netherlands collected data from 75% of national births. The EPIMOMS study in France collected data from six regions: Alsace, Lorraine, Auvergne, Rhone-Alpes, Ile-de-France and Basse-Normandie and these regions represented 18% of national births.

Data come from the below described cohorts.

Denmark: The Danish data were identified and collected using the Danish Medical Birth Registry (DMBR) and the Danish Trans-fusion Database (DTD). During the period 2001-2009, women who had a birth identified in the DMBR and had transfused 10 or more units of red blood cells (RBC) within 24 hours identified from DTD were included in study. The DMBR collects information on all births in Denmark and this includes clinical and demographic data from each birth. The DTD is a national database and contains information of the quantity and type of blood products transfused and the time of each transfusion. Additional data were extracted from the patient charts (Study II in the PhD thesis(PubMed ID 29510809)).

France: This study included data from the EPIMOMS study (PubMed ID 33423750). This is a population-based study that prospectively identified cases of severe maternal morbidity from 6 regions in France: Alsace, Lorraine, Auvergne, Rhone-Alpes, Ile-de-France and Normandy. Cases were identified for a year between 2012-2013 from 113 intensive care units and 118 maternity units. Selected maternal morbidities were identified by a local reporter in each hospital. Data concerning demographics, previous medical history, current pregnancy, causes, management and maternal and perinatal outcomes were collected from the patient charts of each woman. Major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) was one of the severe maternal morbidities in the EPIMOMS study. To be included as a MOH case, women had to be at least 22 weeks of gestation or more and had to meet one of the following criteria: 1. ≥1500mls blood loss; 2. blood transfusion ≥ 4 RBC; 3. uterine artery embolisation, ligation or compressive uterine sutures; 4. have an emergency peripartum hysterectomy; 5. Haemorrhage with organ dysfunction as per EPIMOMS definition.

The Netherlands: TeMpOH-1 was a national retrospective cohort study conducted between January 2011 and January 2013 in the Netherlands, which included 75% of all hospitals. Women were identified using records from blood transfusion services and birth registries of participating hospitals. Data were collected from medical records and included information about previous medical history, current pregnancy, causes of haemorrhage, haematological parameters, blood components, fluid resuscitation and surgical and medical management(PubMed ID31730187 and 30784827). Women who experienced an obstetric haemorrhage and had received at least one of the following were included: 1. four units or more of RBC ; 2. multicomponent blood transfusion (RBC and fresh frozen plasma and/or platelet concentrates); 3. plasma in addition to RBCs as a result of obstetric haemorrhage.

United Kingdom : Data from UK comes from a national surveillance system used to identify cases of massive transfusion from consultant led obstetric units nationally in the UK. Reporters were asked to complete a data collection form using the medical records of the women. Data were collected anonymously. During the period between June 2013 to July 2014, information on women who fulfilled the following criteria were included: 1. received 8 or more units of RBC transfused within 24 hours ; 2. 20 or more weeks of gestation. The United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System was used to identify the patients (https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/downloads/files/ukoss/forms/UKOSS-Major-Obstetric-Haemorrhage.pdf).

The primary objective will be answered using propensity score matching to ensure exchangeability between sPPH patients treated with NovoSeven® and those that were not across data from the Netherlands, Denmark and France (if these are comparable).

For exposed women: Time0 is defined as time of first administration of NovoSeven®. It occurs x minutes after onset of sPPH. For every exposed woman, all unexposed and eligible women are evaluated at this time=time0. The ones with similar propensity score are selected for matching (up to four will be selected). Thus, for unexposed women (matched controls): Time0 is the timepoint used when they were selected for matching. It is equal to the period from onset of sPPH to time of first administration of NovoSeven® for the patient for which they are a matched control. In this way exposed and unexposed women are comparable because they have similar propensity score at the same (specific) Time0.

Generally, the following approach will be taken:

* Propensity score models and matching will be performed separately by country
* Matching will be done within patients with the same delivery mode
* Pooling will be done after matching including all countries which allows formal analysis - this will be the primary population
* The primary analysis will be based on the pooled data - meaning there we will have 1 (primary) p-value for the primary endpoint
* Subgroup-analyses of the primary endpoint will be done by country - there we will have 1 (supportive) p-value per country

Propensity score matching will be performed to ensure comparability between women with an event of sPPH being exposed to NovoSeven® with women with an event of sPPH that are not exposed to NovoSeven at the matching timepoint. In this approach, the propensity score will reflect the estimated probability of being administered with NovoSeven® during the course of severe PPH. A propensity score for every woman with sPPH will be estimated by an appropriate analytic model with NovoSeven® as the dependent variable. Covariates associated with initiation of NovoSeven® administration will be included in a model to calculate propensity scores. Characteristics considered to be potential confounders for the association between use of NovoSeven® and the outcome or characteristics considered to be risk factors for the occurrence of the primary outcome measure alone will be included as covariates in the propensity score model.

Characteristics that could be included as covariates are (not an exhausted list): gestational age, multiple pregnancy, cause of PPH, volume of blood loss at time of intervention, and haemostatic drugs used (other than NovoSeven®) that had already been applied at the time of intervention. A matching algorithm for the propensity score will be used to match women with an event of sPPH exposed to NovoSeven® with women with an event of sPPH that are not at that timepoint. Women will be censored when they have been hysterectomised, dies, or stopped having PPH.

Matching will be done by up to 1:4 with a calliper of 0.1. If this is not possible a calliper of 0.2 will be used instead. The criteria for switching to 0.2 will be described in the SAP.

The estimand will address the relative effect of NovoSeven® compared to propensity score matched controls on the occurrence of invasive procedures in women with an event of sPPH. The five attributes of the estimand can be seen below. The estimand is defined from the following five elements outlined in the ICH E9(R1):

A. The treatment conditions are NovoSeven® vs. propensity scored matched controls not receiving NovoSeven®.

B. The treatment effect will be estimated for women with an event of sPPH defined by the inclusion criteria in the four cohorts exposed to NovoSeven® and their matched controls.

C. The treatment effect is assessed by the occurrence of invasive procedures within 20 minutes to 24 hours following time0.

D. Intercurrent events will be handled by a hypothetical strategy or a treatment policy strategy (further details in protocol Table 1).

E. The treatment effect will be quantified by the odds ratio.","Inclusion Criteria:

National Cancer Institute (NCI),NIH,NCT05009979,18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Background:

A radiotracer (or tracer) is a radioactive substance. It is used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging to help see specific sites in the body. Researchers want to learn if a new tracer can help them better identify hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in people.

Objective:

To learn if a radiotracer called 18F-DCFPyL can identify sites of HCC better than current standard imaging.

Eligibility:

Adults aged 18 years and older who may have HCC based on previous standard imaging.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They will have a computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

Participants will have a whole-body PET/CT scan. The PET and CT scanners use x-rays to make pictures of the inside of the body. The PET uses a tracer to help make the pictures. Participants will get an intravenous (IV) injection of 18F-DCFPyL 1 hour before the scan.

Within two weeks, participants will have a 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. 18F-FDG is a commonly used tracer. They will get 18F-FDG via IV 1 hour before the scan.

Participants will have a CT/MRI within 2 months of the first 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.

Participants will have standard treatment for their cancer. During treatment, they will have a tumor biopsy. If the biopsy shows they do not have HCC, they will be removed from the study.

For participants who have HCC and their cancer was identified in the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT, they will have a second 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT.

Participants will have follow-up visits every 3 months for 2 years. Then they will have yearly visits for 3 years.","Background:

Prostate specific membrane antigen is overexpressed in high-grade tumors, and increases when de-differentiation, metastatic or hormone-refractory disease occur, making the expression level a prognostic factor for disease outcome.

It has been shown that PSMA can be expressed not only on prostate cancer cells, but also on cell lines of other malignancies, as well as tumor endothelium.

A recent publication reported that nearly 95% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stained positive for PSMA in the tumor vasculature. Research suggests that the process of endothelial cell recruitment to HCC occurs early and throughout the process of hepatic tumorigenesis, making an endothelial cell tracer an ideal marker to detect early disease.

18F-DCFPyL, a second generation PSMA PET agent, binds with high affinity to PSMA yet clears rapidly from the blood pool and thus, whole-body PET imaging with this agent, may provide a new tool in staging high risk cancers and detecting recurrent disease.

We propose to expand our clinical work using 18F-DCFPyL, and evaluate its usefulness for detecting sites of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Objective:

To assess the ability of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging to detect sites of hepatocellular carcinoma

Eligibility:

Participants \>= 18 years old

Design:

This is a multi-site imaging study enrolling participants with suspected hepatocellular carcinoma. The accrual ceiling is set to 50 participants.

All participants will undergo a baseline 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan. A standard of care CT and/or MRI will be performed within 2 months of the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. Participants will be also scanned with an 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging within approximately 2 weeks of the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging.

Participants will be scheduled to undergo a biopsy prior to or during standard of care local treatment for HCC (e.g., resection, radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, transarterial embolization (TAE), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)).

Participants with a baseline positive 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT imaging (i.e. with the presence of DCFPyL-avid tumor/s) and biopsy confirming HCC diagnosis will undergo a post-treatment 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging during the first routine follow-up period, typically within 16 weeks. Subjects with negative tumor uptake at baseline 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT will not be re-scanned post-treatment but will remain in follow-up.

Participants with a positive HCC biopsy will be followed for 5 years to assess progression free survival.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

UMC Utrecht,OTHER,NCT01168479,FLAME: Investigate the Benefit of a Focal Lesion Ablative Microboost in Prostate Cancer,FLAME: Single Blind Randomized Phase III Trial to Investigate the Benefit of a Focal Lesion Ablative Microboost in Prostate Cancer,"Rationale: Dose escalation in external-beam irradiation has proven to benefit outcome in local prostate cancer. Randomized trials were performed up to doses of 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Nevertheless, the five-year biochemical relapse rate still was approximately 35% in the high-dose arm. Therefore further dose escalation seems to be required. A feasibility study up to appr. 85 Gy on the entire prostate has already been performed and showed acceptable toxicity when combined with adequate position verification. Higher doses to the entire prostate are expected to increase severe toxicity. As local recurrences only occur at the site of the primary macroscopic tumour area the next step in increasing the dose should be an ablative boost to the macroscopic tumour alone, while electively irradiating the rest of the prostate to the current gold standard dose. Feasibility of this approach has been shown for an ablative dose of 95 Gy to the macroscopic tumour within the prostate.","Objective:

* Primary study objective: To demonstrate the superiority of the ablative microboost dose schedule regarding 5-year biochemical no evidence of disease rate compared to the current standard of care.
* Secondary study objectives: Establish and compare the rates of treatment-related toxicity, quality of life and disease-free survival.

Study design: Single blind prospective randomized controlled phase III trial.

Study population: Patients with intermediate or high risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Intermediate or high risk is defined according to the Ash et al. 2000 criteria as:

* One (intermediate-risk) or more (high-risk) factors: T2, or Gleasonscore=7, or iPSA 10-20 ng/mL
* One or more (high-risk) factors: T3, or Gleasonscore \>7, or iPSA \>20 ng/mL

Intervention: The standard arm receives the current gold standard, namely 77Gy to the prostate in 35 fractions of 2.2 Gy, 5 times per week. In the experimental arm patients receive in addition to the current gold standard of 77 Gy to the prostate an integrated boost to the macroscopically visible tumour to reach a total dose of 95 Gy in 35 fractions of 2.7 Gy, 5 times per week.

Main study endpoint: To decrease the five-year biochemical relapse rate with at least 10%.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

Patients will have to fill in a quality of life questionnaire before and after the radiotherapy treatments. The risk associated with the increased dose to the macroscopic tumour is an increase of toxicity and a reduction of quality of life.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Prostate cancer patients scheduled for external beam radiotherapy using IMRT and fiducial marker-based position verification

Randomized trials were performed up to doses of 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Nevertheless, the five-year biochemical relapse rate still was approximately 35% in the high-dose arm. Therefore further dose escalation seems to be required. A feasibility study up to appr. 85 Gy on the entire prostate has already been performed and showed acceptable toxicity when combined with adequate position verification. Higher doses to the entire prostate are expected to increase severe toxicity. As local recurrences only occur at the site of the primary macroscopic tumour area the next step in increasing the dose should be an ablative boost to the macroscopic tumour alone, while electively irradiating the rest of the prostate to the current gold standard dose. Feasibility of this approach has been shown for an ablative dose of 95 Gy to the macroscopic tumour within the prostate. Objective: * Primary study objective: To demonstrate the superiority of the ablative microboost dose schedule regarding 5-year biochemical no evidence of disease rate compared to the current standard of care. * Secondary study objectives: Establish and compare the rates of treatment-related toxicity, quality of life and disease-free survival. Study design: Single blind prospective randomized controlled phase III trial. Study population: Patients with intermediate or high risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Intermediate or high risk is defined according to the Ash et al. 2000 criteria as: * One (intermediate-risk) or more (high-risk) factors: T2, or Gleasonscore=7, or iPSA 10-20 ng/mL * One or more (high-risk) factors: T3, or Gleasonscore \>7, or iPSA \>20 ng/mL Intervention: The standard arm receives the current gold standard, namely 77Gy to the prostate in 35 fractions of 2.2 Gy, 5 times per week. In the experimental arm patients receive in addition to the current gold standard of 77 Gy to the prostate an integrated boost to the macroscopically visible tumour to reach a total dose of 95 Gy in 35 fractions of 2.7 Gy, 5 times per week. Main study endpoint: To decrease the five-year biochemical relapse rate with at least 10%. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Patients will have to fill in a quality of life questionnaire before and after the radiotherapy treatments. The risk associated with the increased dose to the macroscopic tumour is an increase of toxicity and a reduction of quality of life.

All eligible subjects will be randomized into one of 3 treatment groups (1 of 2 dose levels or matched placebo). Study drug CR845 will be administered intravenously prior to surgery, and at specific time intervals post surgery. Additional rescue pain and anti-nausea medication will be made available. Post surgical changes in pain intensity, nausea and vomiting will be assessed. Patients will be admitted to the surgical center on the day of their abdominal surgery (Day 1, unless admission the night before is required). All patients will be seen by the study staff to confirm eligibility, review study procedures, and conduct all pre-surgical assessments required for randomization. Qualified patients will be randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups, corresponding to 1 of 2 dose levels of intravenous (IV) CR845 (0.5 or 1 mcg/kg) or matched placebo, respectively. Study drug will be administered every 6 hours during the 24-hour post-operative treatment period following these initial 2 drug administrations: * Pre-Operative dose: Within one hour prior to anesthetic induction for surgery. This dose will be a 2X loading dose. * Baseline post-operative dose: within 30-minutes of being considered stable in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) Subsequent dosing will be administered at 6, 12 and 18 hours. During the Treatment and Observation Period, pain intensity scores will be obtained at specified time points and episodes of nausea or vomiting will be recorded. Upon request, patients may be provided with analgesic or anti-nausea rescue medication (restricted to morphine (if tolerated), and ondansetron, respectively) at any time after the Baseline dose of study drug is administered. Blood sampling and safety assessments will be conducted during this period as well.

Mikrobiomik Healthcare Company S.L.,INDUSTRY,NCT05201079,Primary or Recurrent Clostridioides Difficile Infection Treatment With Capsules of Lyophilised Faecal Microbiota vs Fidaxomicin,"A Randomised, Controlled, Open-label Phase III Clinical Trial in Patients With Primary or Recurrent Clostridioides Difficile (CD) Infection, to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Capsules of Lyophilised Faecal Microbiota vs Fidaxomicin.","Patients with microbiota alterations developed after being exposed to antibiotics are especially susceptible to Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI). The incidence and severity of CDI has increased in recent years and CDI recurrences (r-CDI) due to the appearance of new episodes in patients with a previous cured CDI, represent a serious and complex clinical issue. Although antibiotics are the recommended therapy for the first episode of CDI, treatment with oral vancomycin and/or metronidazole often results in significant treatment failure. In addition, the treatment of r-CDI is not adequately standardized, and although the most widely used treatment is the administration of fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab, its efficacy in patients who already have r-CDI is not proven. In the late years, Fecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT) has emerged as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment to manage CDI with multiple recurrences and recent clinical trials have evaluated its potential efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with primary CD infection.

The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the MBK-01 medication, consisting of heterologous lyophilized fecal microbiota capsules coming from healthy donors in comparison to the treatment with fidaxomicin, in 92 patients with primary or r-CDI.","This is a Phase III, multicenter, controlled and open label clinical trial in which patients who suffered an episode of Clostridioides difficile infection (either the first episode or subsequent recurrences) will be randomly assigned (1:1) to one of the following arms:

* Fidaxomicin
* MBK-01 (heterologous lyophilized fecal microbiota)

Objective: To assess the efficacy of FMT with capsules of lyophilized fecal microbiota (MBK-01), compared to the control (fidaxomicin) at 8 weeks after the start of the treatment. Also, assess the safety of MBK-01 and the quality of life of patients participating in the study.

Follow up: participants will return for clinic visits at 72 hours, week 3 and week 8 after the start of the treatment, and will receive follow-up phone calls at month 3 and month 6 after the start of the treatment. Stool samples will be collected from participants for further studies at time 0 and week 8 after the start of the treatment. Study Outcomes are detailed in the specific section of this website.

Rationale: The transferred microbiota restores the recipient's intestinal microbiota by reintroducing bacterial taxa that were absent or in low proportion in the recipient before the FMT. This supports the expansion of the recipient's own commensal microbiota and re-establishing a microbiota community with a high biodiversity.

Donors: All donors are screened to ensure they meet the strict requirements necessary to maintain the safety of the MBK-01.

Justification: The treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) with antibiotics is usually effective for acute symptoms, but after the initial treatment, the probability of recurrence at 8 weeks ranges from 10-20 % of cases, and once a patient has a recurrence, the probability of further recurrences increases up to 40-65 %. In recent years, Fecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT) has emerged as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment to manage CDI with multiple recurrences and recent clinical trials have evaluated its potential efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with primary CD infection. Although antibiotics are the recommended therapy for the first episode of CDI, treatment with oral vancomycin and/or metronidazole often results in significant treatment failure, with recurrences occurring in up to 30-40% of patients. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment does not correct deficiencies in the intestinal microbiota that facilitate CD infection and is associated with the risk of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Moreover, the treatment of recurrences is not adequately standardized. In recent years, although the most widely used alternatives have been fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab, their efficacy in patients who already suffer from r-CDI is not proven. The administration of the FMT through oral capsules, although it is not standardized, has proven to be effective in the restoration of intestinal microbiota of patients with r-CDI. In addition, the use of lyophilized formulas facilitates the concentration of bacteria and further optimizes the donors' sample and reduces the amount of capsules that the patient has to ingest.","Inclusion Criteria:

1. Patients of both genders, over 18 years.
2. Patients that undergo an episode of CD infection (either the first episode or subsequent recurrences).
3. Presence of an episode of diarrhea defined as ≥3 stools/24 hours, at the beginning of the episode.
4. Confirmation of the presence of CD toxin A and/or B in faeces, by a direct toxin detection test or by the PCR technique for the detection of toxin/s producing genes, at the start of the episode that is going to be treated in the clinical trial (the toxin test must be positive within 7 days prior to the enrolment of the patient in the trial).

Rationale: The transferred microbiota restores the recipient's intestinal microbiota by reintroducing bacterial taxa that were absent or in low proportion in the recipient before the FMT. This supports the expansion of the recipient's own commensal microbiota and re-establishing a microbiota community with a high biodiversity. Donors: All donors are screened to ensure they meet the strict requirements necessary to maintain the safety of the MBK-01. Justification: The treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) with antibiotics is usually effective for acute symptoms, but after the initial treatment, the probability of recurrence at 8 weeks ranges from 10-20 % of cases, and once a patient has a recurrence, the probability of further recurrences increases up to 40-65 %. In recent years, Fecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT) has emerged as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment to manage CDI with multiple recurrences and recent clinical trials have evaluated its potential efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with primary CD infection. Although antibiotics are the recommended therapy for the first episode of CDI, treatment with oral vancomycin and/or metronidazole often results in significant treatment failure, with recurrences occurring in up to 30-40% of patients. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment does not correct deficiencies in the intestinal microbiota that facilitate CD infection and is associated with the risk of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Moreover, the treatment of recurrences is not adequately standardized. In recent years, although the most widely used alternatives have been fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab, their efficacy in patients who already suffer from r-CDI is not proven. The administration of the FMT through oral capsules, although it is not standardized, has proven to be effective in the restoration of intestinal microbiota of patients with r-CDI. In addition, the use of lyophilized formulas facilitates the concentration of bacteria and further optimizes the donors' sample and reduces the amount of capsules that the patient has to ingest. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Patients of both genders, over 18 years. 2. Patients that undergo an episode of CD infection (either the first episode or subsequent recurrences). 3. Presence of an episode of diarrhea defined as ≥3 stools/24 hours, at the beginning of the episode. 4. Confirmation of the presence of CD toxin A and/or B in faeces, by a direct toxin detection test or by the PCR technique for the detection of toxin/s producing genes, at the start of the episode that is going to be treated in the clinical trial (the toxin test must be positive within 7 days prior to the enrolment of the patient in the trial). Exclusion Criteria: 1. Previous faecal microbiota transfer. 2. Transplanted patients, except those with a solid organ transplant of more than 2 years, with good organ function. 3. Absolute neutrophil count \<500 cells /μL at the time of the enrollment in the study. 4. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or pregnancy intentions over the course of the study. 5. Active treatment with bile acid sequestrants (for instance: cholestyramine). 6. Positive patients for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) except those with lymphocytes T CD4 count \> 200 cells/μL and viral load less than 20 copies. 7. Swallowing dysfunction or no oral motor coordination. 8. Patient admitted in an intensive care unit or expected to be admitted in an intensive care unit due to serious illness. 9. History of significant medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow an adequate evaluation or follow-up of the patient."

University of Florida,OTHER,NCT02780479,Steroids in Children Hospitalized With Asthma,Oral Dexamethasone Versus Oral Prednisone in Children Hospitalized With Asthma: A Randomized Control Study,"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children. A short (3-5 day) course of a short-acting steroid such as Prednisone or Prednisolone has long been the standard of care for asthma exacerbation. Dexamethasone efficacy in asthma exacerbation has been studied in the outpatient setting and was found to be as effective as Prednisone. Dexamethasone has the advantage of shorter course, more compliance, and more tolerable. This has led many emergency departments to provide a 1-2 dose course of Dexamethasone on discharge. Thus, many inpatients have received a first dose of Dexamethasone prior to reaching the inpatient unit, leading to confusion about the best plan for these patients. Many hospitalist pediatricians continue to give a 5-day total course with Prednisone, but some patients have begun to receive a second dose of Dexamethasone 24 hours after the first dose. To our knowledge, no studies have been done to compare the efficacy of these two protocols in pediatric patients requiring hospitalization. The hypothesis is that a second dose of Dexamethasone is as effective as four additional days of Prednisone in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbation. This is an open label, randomized control study comparing these treatments in children age 2-18 hospitalized with asthma exacerbation who have received a first dose of Dexamethasone.","Corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for managing acute asthma exacerbations. Studies have shown that systemic steroids effect decrease relapse and hospital admission. Due to its short half-life, Prednisone is usually given daily or twice daily for 3-5 days. It has been associated with poor compliance due it the prolonged course. Dexamethasone half-life is 36 - 72 hours.

Several studies have shown no difference in outcomes between 3-5 days of prednisone and different forms of dexamethasone, including single intramuscular dose or single oral dose or two oral doses 1 day apart. However, those studies were done in the emergency department (ED). Lack of response to initial asthma treatment in ED results in admission to the hospital, implying more severe exacerbation than those able to be discharged. Some clinician shift to oral prednisone once admitted to the floor for patients who have received Dexamethasone or not. Others have begin to complete the Dexamethasone course with one more dose of Dexamethasone 24 hour after the first dose. Dexamethasone has the advantage of compliance and tolerability, however, no studies investigated its efficacy in hospitalized patients. Such knowledge will improve patient's compliance and outcomes.

The purpose of this study is to determine if exenatide and sitagliptin increase the amount of insulin made by the pancreas compared to glimepiride. It is hypothesized that exenatide or sitagliptin will sustain or increase the amount of insulin made by the pancreas in comparison to glimepiride.","The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached epidemic proportions throughout the world. In the United States more than 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in 2005, and the estimated prevalence of the disease was over 20 million. Another 54 million Americans are believed to have impaired fasting glucose, which represents a ""pre-diabetic"" state at increased risk for progression to overt diabetes. T2D ultimately results from an inadequate mass of functional beta-cells, where insufficient beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance leads to the development of impaired glucose tolerance and eventually diabetes. Autopsy studies have demonstrated a decreased beta-cell mass occurring with fasting glucose \> 110 mg/dl, consistent with functional studies that demonstrate decreased beta-cell (insulin) secretory capacity beginning in the range of impaired fasting glucose. Strategies that might preserve or expand functional beta-cell mass in vivo would be expected to reverse the progressive deterioration in blood glucose control seen with diabetes. One such strategy involves the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is trophic for islet beta-cells, having both pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects. However, it is not known whether increasing GLP-1 effects can preserve or enhance functional beta-cell mass in humans. This proposal will determine the effect of increasing GLP-1 levels on functional beta-cell mass in human subjects with impaired fasting glucose (fasting glucose 110 - 126 mg/dl) or early T2D (fasting glucose 127 - 149 mg/dl) where a critical window exists for reversing further beta-cell deterioration. GLP-1 effects will be promoted by administration of either the GLP-1 analog, exenatide, or by increasing endogenous GLP-1 levels through administration of the oral dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor sitagliptin for a 6-month period. To control for the effect of exenatide and sitagliptin on normalization of blood glucose, subjects will be randomized to receive exenatide, sitagliptin or the sulfonylurea glimepiride, the latter being a first-line anti-diabetogenic agent that will serve as an active comparator.","Inclusion Criteria:

The main question it aims to answer is that is it safe to do the surgery without using them? to answer this question researchers will access recorded data of patients that underwent refractive surgeries in a private clinic since 2017 and compare them as two groups: those who underwent the traditional procedures and those who had it without the use of dispersive viscoelastics in regard to their vision before and after surgery, their ocular pressure and biomicroscopic analysis of the inside of their corneas before and after surgery.","Records of patients that had undergone ICL implantation surgery in Al-Ferdows private eye hospital in Baghdad between 2017 and 2023 were accessed. Two groups of patients were identified, for the first group the ICL was implanted with the use of both dispersive and cohesive OVDs (traditional OVD group) and for the second one a novel method of implantation was used without utilizing dispersive OVD (reduced OVD) group. Both types of surgery were done by the same surgeon and in the same settings. The operative notes of the OVD group were as follows: under topical anesthesia if the ICL is toric, manual corneal marking is done in the sitting position using pendular marker. After loading of the ICL, two-step clear corneal main incision 2.8 mm in width with a bit long track of 1.5-2 mm to enhance its valve action was fashioned. Intracameral injection of dispersive OVD. The ICL was implanted with mouth-to-mouth technique. Anterior chamber reformation with cohesive OVD, then haptics are gently pushed behind the iris using an olive-tipped manipulator, ensuring alignment to proper axis in case of toric ICL, otherwise spherical ICL is placed directly at 180° axis. After that, AC (anterior chamber) wash with irrigation/aspiration is performed then stromal hydration was done to seal the surgical wound. In the reduced OVD group, modification to the traditional method involved omitting the step of dispersive OVD injection and instead utilizing Intracameral injection of 1:1 mixture of 1:1000 adrenaline and 2% lidocaine in an overfilling manner. All other surgical steps are performed in an identical manner.

Joo-Yong Hahn,OTHER,NCT04418479,SMart Angioplasty Research Team: CHoice of Optimal Anti-Thrombotic Strategy in Patients Undergoing Implantation of Coronary Drug-Eluting Stents 3,Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin Monotherapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Standard Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients At High Risk for Recurrent Ischemic Events,"This study is a prospective, open-label, two-arm, randomized multicenter trial to compare the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel versus aspirin monotherapy beyond the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (more than 12 months for myocardial infarction \[MI\] and more than 6 months for non-MI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients at high risk of recurrent ischemic events.","After the introduction of the second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), the rates of device-related failure or target lesion failure such as restenosis and stent thrombosis has been markedly decreased, compared with the era of bare-metal stents or first-generation DES. Nevertheless, the risk of ischemic events including very late stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has still remained even though the use of second-generation DES. In this regard, the ACC (American College of Cardiology)/AHA (American Heart Association) and ESC (European Society of Cardiology) guidelines recommended that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) should be considered for 12 months or longer in patients presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and for 6 months or longer in patients presented with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) after PCI with DES. In particular, patients presented with a high risk of ischemic events such as diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, or complex coronary lesions were associated with significantly increased future recurrent ischemic events after PCI with DES. In addition, maintenance of DAPT for 12 months or longer has been shown to reduce the recurrence of ischemic events up to 44% in patients treated with PCI for complex coronary artery lesion; therefore the current guideline recommended that prolonged DAPT might be considered when performing complex PCI. However, prolonged DAPT increases bleeding risk and cost. Endoscopic, dental, and surgical procedures are often delayed due to prolonged DAPT, which may affect the patient's quality of life. Therefore, to determine the optimal or minimal necessary duration of DAPT is very important.

The other important issue is that which antiplatelet agent is more appropriate after DAPT. Aspirin monotherapy has been recommended traditionally. However, there is no randomized comparison study between aspirin monotherapy versus clopidogrel monotherapy after DAPT in patients undergoing PCI with DES. Furthermore, clopidogrel is also actively used as a monotherapy after DAPT in real-world practice. In CAPRIE (clopidogrel versus aspirin in patients at risk of ischemic events) trial, clopidogrel showed a superior efficacy in preventing ischemic events compared with aspirin. Moreover, the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly lower with clopidogrel than with aspirin. Clopidogrel monotherapy can reduce ischemic events and bleeding risk compared with aspirin monotherapy.

Therefore, the purpose of the SMART-CHOICE 3 (SMart Angioplasty Research Team: CHoice of Optimal Anti-Thrombotic Strategy in Patients Undergoing Implantation of Coronary Drug-Eluting Stents 3) trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel monotherapy compared with aspirin monotherapy beyond the standard duration of DAPT after PCI with current-generation DES in patients at high risk for recurrent ischemic events.","Inclusion Criteria:

Rudy Reindl,OTHER,NCT00597779,Randomized Comparison of 2 Fixation Techniques for Unstable Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures,Extramedullary vs. Intramedullary Devices in the Treatment of Unstable Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures,"The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and radiological outcome of patients that are treated with two different orthopedic implants. The study population will consist of patients that have sustained unstable hip fractures. The two different implants will be randomly assigned.

The null hypothesis states that there should not be any significant differences between the two implants.","Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common injuries in the elderly population. They often signify generalized physical deterioration. Operative management has become the standard of care to prevent life threatening complications and dates back to the 1940's. The design of implants has evolved significantly since then.

The sliding hip screw replaced static fixation of the femoral head in the 1950's. As a result of this improvement in design, failures have been reduced to 9-16%. The sliding hip screw allows for stable collapse of the femoral neck. This can lead to significant shortening of the proximal femur in comminuted fractures.

Current treatment modalities focus on obtaining a satisfactory union of the fracture, often at the expense of anatomical alignment. Severely comminuted fractures treated with a standard plate-hip-screw device thus commonly result in significant degrees of mal-union and shortening. In the past, implants designed to restore and maintain the anatomy of the hip have resulted in high failure rates with the implant breaking out of the femoral head. In the mid 1980's, recognition of this led to the development of various intramedullary devices for fixation of these fractures. The weight-bearing portion of the implant is therefore shifted medially, resulting in reduced lever forces on the implant and femur. Additionally, the IM device does not rely on fixation to the lateral cortex of the femur with screws. From a biomechanical standpoint, the intramedullary device has distinct advantages, as it is a load- sharing device more closely located to the axis of weight bearing than the plate-hip-screw device.

Advances in intramedullary designs have been promising, but the clinical results variable. The relatively high rate of fracture at the tip, specifically at the level of the locking bolts, has hampered the widespread popularity of intramedullary devices. Additionally, the large diameter of the proximal aspect of the implants required extensive reaming of the greater trochanter and partial detachment of the gluteus medius. This may lead to abductor weakness and a Trendelenburg gait. Some studies have found increased re-operation rates for these early hip-nail devices compared to the plate -hip-screw implant. Other studies have shown decreased blood loss and operative time with the nails. A meta-analysis of the literature favors the sliding hip screw design. Unfortunately, most studies focus on radiological failure rate rather than patient function and relate to the first generation of IM devices.

The newest generation of nails (like the IM studied here) has attempted to correct the shortcomings of earlier designs. The proximal aspect of the nail diameter is minimized. The distal locking screw is located far away from the distal end of the nail and the locking bolt is placed in an oblique fashion. Design alterations to the femoral head fixation portion of the nail by using a helical blade rather than a screw may improve fixation in the femoral head. These new designs seem to compare favorably in recent clinical tests. Early mobilization for patients with the intramedullary device (IM) seems to be better.

Results of the pilot study indicate an earlier return to full mobility and shorter operating time in the IM group. This study included all intertrochanteric fracture types and did not demonstrate a clear benefit of the IM in many other parameters. The currently proposed multi-centre study will focus on the unstable A2 intertrochanteric fracture pattern.

Considering the significantly increased cost of the new intramedullary devices compared to the standard plate-hip-screw, a significant overall improvement in patient function should be realized before the general use of these new devices could be recommended.","Inclusion Criteria:

All donors who underwent COS for oocyte donation between January 1st, 2018 and July 31th, 2022 were screened for eligibility and followed up to September 18th, 2022.

Oocyte donation cycles were utilized because this model is an excellent choice for controlling known female characteristics. Previous research concluded that a major predictor of ART outcomes is maternal age.

Eligibility criteria were donors aged older than 18 years or younger than 35 years. After providing informed consent, the patients were questioned about their confirmed past SARS-Cov-2 infection/vaccination status. Patients were categorized into the vaccinated group if they had received two dosages of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2 mRNA Pfizer-Biontech, mRNA-1273 Moderna or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Sinovac) with a break of at least three weeks between each dose. First and second vaccine dates were requested of vaccinated patients. Vaccine administration details, such as vaccine type, dose, date, manufacturer, and lot number, were collected from immunization records.

For recovering patients, the date of a negative nasopharyngeal COVID polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was registered. None of the recovering patients were vaccinated with any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Both clinics strictly required a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection 5 days before oocyte retrieval, except for those patients who were less than 3 months following recovery from SARS-Cov-2 infection. Patients in the control group were selected from medical records prior to March 2020 to ensure they did not have the infection and were not vaccinated.

Data including the patient age, body mass index (BMI), antral follicle count (AFC), anti mullerian hormone (AMH), days of stimulation, average dose of gonadotropins, the number of retrieved oocytes, mature oocytes, fertilized oocytes and top quality embryos obtained were recorded. Other parameters were calculated such as the ratio between the number of retrieved oocytes and the number of mature follicles in order to assess the adequacy of response of the follicle to the LH/hCG trigger; the fertilization rate (FR), which was defined as the proportion of inseminated oocytes with 2PN at the time of the fertilization check on Day 1 and finally the blastocyst development rate, defined as the proportion of 2PN zygotes which are at the blastocyst stage at Day 5.

"University Hospital, Montpellier",OTHER,NCT02710279,Response to Social Rejection in Suicidal Behavior,Response to Social Rejection in Suicidal Behavior,"Suicide is a major health problem that causes annually a million death worldwild. In the stress-vulnerability model, suicidal behavior (SB) results from the interaction between an individual's predisposition and stressful condition. We hypothesized that the sensitivity to social exclusion may represent a core component of the suicidal vulnerability Recent evidence also suggest that inflammatory mediators plays a critical role in SB. Furthermore, social stressors are particulary strong and specific triggers of inflammatory response.

To sum up, patients carrying a suicidal vulnerability are expected to present greater responses to social rejection in terms of inflammatory activity and psychological pain.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the psychological and inflammatory responses to a social stressor validated, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) . We will also investigate the moderating effect of childhood abuse, attachment, trait rejection sensitivity and social isolation.

In the second part of the study, we will also investigate the prospective association between inflammatory responses induces by laboratory paradigms of social rejection and the occurrence of social distress, suicidal ideation and psychological pain in response to social exclusion events in real life (using ecological momentary assessment).","Over one year, we will recruit 140 female outpatients suffering from a major depressive episode with (n=70) and without any history of suicide attempt (n=70) from a specialized clinic for mood disorders and SB.

First visit: clinical, biological and neuropsychological assessment Second visit: The TSST is a standardized laboratory psychosocial stress protocol that involves public speaking, role play, and mental arithmetic tasks in front of a panel of confederate judges.

These processes include adhesion of the blastocyst to the endometrial surface \& trophoblastic differentiation \& invasion.

A recent Cochrane review hinted towards research to study the possible effects of the local (uterine), \& NOT SYSTEMIC application of heparin during Assisted reproductive technology (ART). Based on the above evidence the investigators hypothesize that low molecular weight heparin given intrauterine at mock embryo transfer after oocyte pick up will help improve pregnancy rates in patients undergoing ART.","Following ethical approval of the committee of Egyptian IVF-ET center, a pilot prospective randomized controlled study will include 40 patients, in which the study arm (group A ) will be injected with LMWH intrauterine during mock embryo transfer, just after ovum pickup, while the control arm (group B) will be injected intrauterine with similar volume tissue culture media (G.2 plus ref. 10132, Vitrolife) also after ovum pickup. Admission into either group will be through randomization after inclusion \& exclusion criteria have been met and before start of controlled ovarian stimulation protocol.

The standard long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist protocol will be used for patients with predicted normal response based on clinical \& hormonal profile ; 1 mg of leuprolide acetate daily s.c injection (Lucrin ®; Abbott, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) is applied from the mid luteal phase onward till the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) injection.

Gonadotropins in the form of human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) (Merional ®, IBSA, Institut Biochimique SA, Lugano, Switzerland) will be given by intramuscular injection (IM) from the 2nd day of menstruation, The starting dose range from 150 to 450 IU depending on the basal follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level, Antral follicle count (AFC) , Patient's age and body mass index (BMI).

In all protocols, stimulation is monitored by trans vaginal ultrasonography and serial estradiol (E2) measurements starting from day 7 of the cycle and the gonadotropin dose is adjusted individually according to follicular response.

After the development of at least three leading follicles≥18 mm, 10,000 unit of HCG (Choriomon, IBSA, Institut Biochimique SA) is given IM, and a trans-vaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is performed 36 hours later.

After scheduled oocyte pick up, a mock embryo transfer will be done using labotec catheter (Labotec, Gottingen Germany), and an injection of Enaoxaprin sodium (LMWH) (Clexane® Sanofi S.A Paris, France) will be given intrauterine in group A patients.

LMWH is safe in pregnancy, category B drug , and given empirically sometimes in luteal phase and in early 1st trimester without reported problems, it has a half life of 4 Hours, and therefore it should not have any negative effects on developing embryos as it will not be present at the time of transfer while already performing it s desired effect on the endometrium.

The dose of LMWH given was calculated comparatively according to the work done by our group Mansour et.al, 2011, where intrauterine administration 500 IU of HCG improved the implantation and pregnancy rates.

Given the fact that this has not been attempted before, the best way to compare two different drugs is through biological activity. So if the investigators want to use 500 IU of LMWH, and knowing that In the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg), so to get 500 IU of LMWH we need 5mg. Clexane 20mg is packed in a 0.2ml syringe, And therefore the investigators need to inject 0.05ml intrauterine using labotec catheter. (1/4 OF THE ORIGINAL SYRINGES CONTENT..i.e 5mg).

The control arm (group B) will be injected intrauterine with similar volume of tissue culture media (G.2 plus ref. 10132, Vitrolife) Oocytes are then fertilized in vitro using ICSI and after three to five days embryo transfer will be done using labotec catheter (Labotec, Gottingen Germany) with ultrasound guidance.

Progesterone pessaries 400 mg twice daily (Cyclogest 400mg ®Actavis plc. Dublin, Ireland) is given as a luteal support starting from the day of embryo transfer and continued for 16 days after.

Pregnancy is defined as the occurrence of a positive β-HCG \>10 IU on day 12 after embryo transfer and a second higher value 2 days later, followed by ultrasonography confirmation of cardiac activity at 6 weeks gestation

A third party not involved in the actual study will moniter progress of the results and record them. Study will be stopped if more than 10 consecutive patients fail to get pregnant in the LMWH group. If the pregnancy rate \>25% in the intervention group by the end of 20 cases, then recruitment willl continue till 60 patients are enrolled on each study arm.","Inclusion Criteria:

Hemanext,INDUSTRY,NCT03301779,Clinical Investigation to Evaluate the Hemanext® Oxygen Reduction System - Pivotal Trial,Clinical Investigation to Evaluate the New Health Sciences Hemanext® Oxygen Reduction System for Leukoreduced Red Blood Cells With CP2D Anticoagulant and AS-3 Additive - Pivotal Trial,"The primary goal of Hemanext. is to improve red cell storage through novel storage methods. Based on our review of the pertinent literature, there is substantial evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure to oxygen during storage results in oxidative damage to the red blood cells leading to decreased therapeutic potential. Therefore, removal of oxygen from red blood cell products prior to storage has potential to preserve the cells in a more physiologically relevant state.

Currently, Hemanext has focused on the design and development of a dual compartment bag system designated as the Hemanext Red Blood Cell Processing System. After standard processing of donated whole blood units into leukoreduced packed red blood cells (LR-RBCs) with the appropriate additive solutions, the LR-RBCs would then be placed in the oxygen reduction bag (ORB) which allows for the rapid diffusion of oxygen out of the blood, through a sterile, oxygen-permeable membrane, and into iron-based oxygen sorbents. After processing, the blood is transferred again from the ORB into the Hemanext storage bag (HSB) which will preserve the anaerobic state of the LR-RBC product for the duration of cold storage.

Hemanext has conducted preliminary storage tests to ascertain the effects of anaerobic storage on overall blood health in various storage solutions.

Usually, oxygen supplementation is delivered using constant-flow rates. Varying oxygenation levels may occur throughout patients´ changing activity. There is some evidence available that an auto-regulating oxygen flow system (FreeO2), which adjusts the oxygen flow automatically to prevent desoxygenation could be beneficial in comparison to a constant oxygen dose of 2 liter/min during walking. However, these possible benefits are unknown if the FreeO2 is compared to a constant oxygen dose according to the individual prescription. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of auto-regulated oxygen flow rates compared to constant oxygen flow rates as prescribed according to international guidelines on walking capacity in patients with COPD.","Rationale:

Hypoxemia is frequently observed in COPD and thus can negatively impact exercise tolerance. Supplemental oxygen or long-term oxygen therapy is recommended to ensure that the patient is still able to manage his daily life. Usually, oxygen supplementation is delivered using constant flow rates during day- and nighttime or as needed. However, studies have shown, that auto-regulated oxygen flow systems (FreeO2) may enhance the patients endurance, lower the time in severe hypoxemia and increase the time spent within the SpO2 target range.

Aim of this study is to investigate the effects off an auto-regulated oxygen flow system in hypoxemic COPD patients on the patient´s endurance, the oxygen saturation, the pCO2 blood level as well as on heart rate and breathing frequency compared to the effects off the prescribed constant flow (according to the British Thoracic Society Guidelines for Home Oxygen Use in Adults) during an endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT). Additionally, patients experience, e.g. comfort and Preference of the Oxygen-delivery System will be documented.

Design:

This study is a randomized, controlled cross-over trial.

"University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland",OTHER,NCT01540279,Clinical Outcome in View of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) With Antibacterial Skin Sutures,Do Antibacterial Skin Sutures Reduce Surgical Site Infections After Open Abdominal Surgery?,"Background: Poor wound healing and the development of surgical site infection (SSI) continue to occur and remain a significant cause of disability among operated patients. In spite of the substantial advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention it remains one of the most common complications in conventional abdominal surgery with an incidence in the literature between 4% and 17%. As it is known that surgical sutures potentiate the development of wound infection the search for an ideal suture material, suitable for all purposes has been pursued by surgeons for decades.

Hypothesis: In line with in-vitro results the investigators hypothesize that the use of antibacterial skin sutures with triclosan poliglecaprone 25 reduces the rate of SSI after open abdominal surgery Methods: To prevent microbial colonization of suture material in operative wounds and therefore to prevent SSI, triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25 suture materials with antibacterial activity will be tested against un-coated suture material for skin closure after open abdominal surgery of 200 patients. The study is planed as a single center, randomized controlled trial. After ethical approval the patients will be consecutively enrolled from 2011 to 2012 in the Department of Visceral Surgery, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The patients will be followed for 30 days (day 3,7 and 30) to detect and document wound complications. Wound complications will be classified according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention Standard guidelines. Data will be collected and the rate of SSI will be analysed in both groups.

Expected value of the proposed project: If the investigators can confirm the proposed hypothesis in our study this could be a promising and feasible approach to lower SSI after open abdominal surgery and might be also used in other surgical fields. By lowering the rate of SSI the investigators might offer a new and cost saving procedure to the surgical community.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

The safety will be assessed by measuring a serum calcium level within 1 week of supplementation. Efficacy will be assessed using repeated 25OHD levels throughout the course of 12 months.

A 25OHD level greater than 30 ng/dL has been described as providing potential improvements to markers of inflammation in adults with CF and is known to improve bone mineral density and prevent bone fractures in all populations, including CF.

Children between the ages of 3 years and 18 years (inclusive), with a 25OHD level \<30 ng/dL will be provided with a vitamin D3 supplement of 250,000 international units (IU) observed in our CF clinic. We hypothesize that this one-time, oral, high dose of vitamin D3 will safely and effectively raise the 25OHD level to above 30 ng/dL.

Safety will be monitored with serum calcium levels 1 week following the dosage, since 25OHD has a half-life of 2-3 weeks and this serum calcium level measurement time-point would be in or near the middle of this range.

* Substitute tacrolimus (TAC) with sirolimus and continue mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or
* Continue with tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)

A total of 400 patients are expected to be screened for the randomization. We expect to randomize 275 renal transplant patients into this protocol (275 donors to be recruited).

The following data will be collected at the time of randomization:

Recipient demographics: (i) age at transplantation, (ii) sex, and (iii) race.

Clinical history: (i) causes of end-stage renal disease, and (ii) past medical history.

Transplant related information: (i) donor age, (ii) cadaveric versus living kidney transplant, (iii) histocompatibility and cross match data, (iv) viral serology, (v) history of acute rejection and delayed graft function, (vi) use of induction therapy and immunosuppressants, (vii) use of ACEI and/or ARB, and (viii) level of renal allograft function-estimated GFR (e-GFR(12) using MDRD formula, proteinuria.

Peripheral blood leukocytes will be obtained from renal transplant recipients for baseline (prior to randomization) lymphocytes functional activity and characterization of lymphocytes subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis.

Peripheral donor leukocytes (from living donor patients) will also be obtained at the time of randomization. These donor leukocytes will be used as stimulator cells to study the functional activity of the recipient's lymphocytes function.

The recipients assigned to continue with tacrolimus and MMF will be routinely followed at the outpatient Comprehensive Transplant Center (CTC) with monthly labs. In addition to labs at baseline pre-randomization, 6, 12 and 24 Months post-randomization, peripheral blood leukocytes will be obtained to study lymphocytes functional activity and to characterize lymphocytes subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis.

Post randomization: The recipients assigned to switch from tacrolimus to sirolimus and continue with MMF will be routinely followed at the CTC with monthly labs. During the period of conversion from tacrolimus to sirolimus, weekly labs will be obtained to monitor renal function and bone marrow function. In addition to labs at baseline pre-randomization, 6, 12 and 24 Months post-randomization, peripheral blood leukocytes will be obtained to study lymphocytes functional activity to characterize lymphocytes subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis. Urine will be collected to assess tubular toxicity by evaluating urinary biomarkers.

Both groups of patients will be followed for 2 years post-randomization. In addition to monitoring renal allograft function, we will evaluate the incidence of acute rejection, patient and graft survival, impact of CI conversion on the lipid profile, incidence of hypertension, malignancies, opportunistic infections, and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (DM). For those willing to undergo an optional kidney biopsy, one will be performed at the end of the second year in order to evaluate renal allograft pathology and renal allograft tissue gene expression profiles of the two groups.

With the peripheral leukocytes obtained at baseline prior to randomization and at 6, 12 and 24 Months post-randomization, we will investigate possible modifications of lymphocytes function and the lymphocytes subpopulations that might have occurred as a consequence of the switch from tacrolimus to sirolimus.

Obtaining renal allograft tissue samples at 24 months post randomization can have potential important ramifications to help explain the mechanisms of fibrosis and tubular atrophy typically associated with CI and the role of CI elimination with the substitution of sirolimus (SRL). All data will then be analyzed comparing gene expression profiles of peripheral blood (Pax gene tubes are routinely collected at the different time points as part of the original study). Based on power analysis, we will perform 24 months post randomization biopsies in 70% of the total subjects enrolled in the study (approximately 46 subjects from the tacrolimus/MMF group and approximately 93 subjects from the sirolimus/MMF group).

We plan to obtain renal allograft biopsies at 24 Months for those that consent for this additional biopsy. This will be compared to the standard of care 12 months post-transplant biopsy to allow us to address the effect of immunosuppressive modifications on renal allograft pathology at 24 months post randomization. Renal allograft biopsies will also be stored in RNA later to further extend our knowledge on the effect of CI free immunosuppression on gene expression profiles.","Inclusion Criteria:

The intervention consisted of a module designed for postpartum mothers, incorporating nutrition and physical activity entitled Mommies can Eat \& Exercise with No Stress (MomEENS).","The intervention is aim to encourage the participant to have better nutrition intake and engage in low to moderate-intensity exercise on 3 to 5 days per week, for 8 weeks in order to improve their psychosocial well-being. After being informed about the study and potential risks, the participants will be screened according to their eligibility criteria. The participants who are eligible to participate in the study will be contacted again and asked for consent to join the study. After obtaining the consent, the participant will undergo a baseline assessment, and subsequently, the investigator will assign the participant to their respective groups, the intervention and control groups. All of the health assessments will be conducted at baseline, 4th week and 8th week.

In intervention group, the participant will be provided an educational module entitled ""Mommies can Eat and Exercise with No Stress"" (MomEENS), in which the module will be delivered through a booklet and video. The MomEENS module incorporated achievement-based objectives for five key recommendations: 1. Eat healthy foods ;2. Eat foods rich in iron and folic acid; 3. Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids; 4.

Emory University,OTHER,NCT04154384,Life Care Specialists (LCS) With a Focus on Patient Pain Management and Prevention of Substance Misuse,Life Care Specialists (LCS) With a Focus on Patient Pain Management and Prevention of Substance Misuse,"The overall hypothesis of this randomized-controlled trial is that the introduction of a Life Care Specialist (LCS) as a novel member of the clinical care team will help reduce opioid utilization, decrease pain scores, and improve patient understanding of their addiction risk in the aftermath of orthopaedic trauma.","Opioids are psychoactive substances (narcotics) primarily used for pain relief by producing morphine-like effects. Although regularly prescribed by physicians, opioids (including morphine, codeine, and oxycodone) are highly addictive. Opioids block feelings of pain and trigger a release of dopamine. Dependence occurs with repeated use, as the parts of the brain naturally responsible for releasing dopamine rely on the drug for proper function. When avoided, patients quickly experience severe withdrawal symptoms similar to the flu.

In the United States, millions are prescribed opioids for pain relief. Every day, more than 115 people die from overdose. The highest among them are people aged 25 to 54 years. Addiction treatment costs near $78.5 billion and rising, less than 10% of people in need are receiving it.

Within the orthopaedic trauma population at Grady Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia, 20% of patients report a history of substance abuse, 30% have previously used opioid medications for pain, and nearly 25% report taking opioid pain medications up to 1 year after their trauma. Trauma patients are particularly at high risk.

The Christopher Wolf Crusade (CWC) is a 501C3 non-profit providing preventative solutions, education, and advocacy for the American opioid epidemic. CWC's primary focus is to introduce a behavior-specific intervention at the time of inpatient hospitalization for trauma to decrease overall opioid utilization and improve pain control in the post-trauma time period. The goal of this study is to introduce the LCS to the healthcare field to focus on pain management and addiction prevention for patients. The LCS is a behavior-based pain ""coach"" who educates patients on risks of opioid dependence and offers non-traditional non-pharmacologic options for pain control. In addition, the LCS will act as a liaison between the patient and the physician to ensure that traditional pharmacologic-based pain control regimens are optimized.

The pain management protocol was refined through a pilot, single-center study where the LCS provided personalized pain management strategies to patients combating pain. Participants in the single-arm pilot portion of the study were enrolled beginning in February 2020 and data collection for these 121 participants was completed April 15, 2021.

The clinical trial portion of this study will include 200 patients who will be consented, enrolled, and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to A) receive the current standard-of-care for pain management in the aftermath of trauma or B) additional LCS intervention. All participants will have the same quantity and quality of interaction with their usual clinical providers and will be followed in the orthopaedic trauma clinic at routine post-operative intervals (2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months post-operatively).","Inclusion Criteria for Single-Arm Pilot Portion of this Study:

When avoided, patients quickly experience severe withdrawal symptoms similar to the flu. In the United States, millions are prescribed opioids for pain relief. Every day, more than 115 people die from overdose. The highest among them are people aged 25 to 54 years. Addiction treatment costs near $78.5 billion and rising, less than 10% of people in need are receiving it. Within the orthopaedic trauma population at Grady Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia, 20% of patients report a history of substance abuse, 30% have previously used opioid medications for pain, and nearly 25% report taking opioid pain medications up to 1 year after their trauma. Trauma patients are particularly at high risk. The Christopher Wolf Crusade (CWC) is a 501C3 non-profit providing preventative solutions, education, and advocacy for the American opioid epidemic. CWC's primary focus is to introduce a behavior-specific intervention at the time of inpatient hospitalization for trauma to decrease overall opioid utilization and improve pain control in the post-trauma time period. The goal of this study is to introduce the LCS to the healthcare field to focus on pain management and addiction prevention for patients. The LCS is a behavior-based pain ""coach"" who educates patients on risks of opioid dependence and offers non-traditional non-pharmacologic options for pain control. In addition, the LCS will act as a liaison between the patient and the physician to ensure that traditional pharmacologic-based pain control regimens are optimized. The pain management protocol was refined through a pilot, single-center study where the LCS provided personalized pain management strategies to patients combating pain. Participants in the single-arm pilot portion of the study were enrolled beginning in February 2020 and data collection for these 121 participants was completed April 15, 2021. The clinical trial portion of this study will include 200 patients who will be consented, enrolled, and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to A) receive the current standard-of-care for pain management in the aftermath of trauma or B) additional LCS intervention. All participants will have the same quantity and quality of interaction with their usual clinical providers and will be followed in the orthopaedic trauma clinic at routine post-operative intervals (2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months post-operatively).

University of Ulster,OTHER,NCT04136379,Comparison of Home and Standard Clinic Monitoring of INR in Patients With CHD,Comparison of Efficacy and Outcomes for Home and Standard Clinic Monitoring of INR in Patients With Congenital Heart Disease,"Summary: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent form of birth defect with a global rate of 1.35 million newborns born with CHD annually. Patients with CHD have an increased risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) compared to age-matched control populations. Anticoagulation with warfarin is the mainstay of antithrombotic treatment in these patients and requires frequent monitoring of the International Normalized Ratio (INR). The CoaguChek monitor is a point of care device that enables patients to self-monitor and manage their INR without the need to attend a warfarin clinic. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and outcomes of standard clinic management and home management of INR in patients with CHD. Analysis of time in therapeutic range (TTR), INR variability, major and minor bleeding events, incidence of CVA and other thrombotic events will be undertaken. Original Hypothesis: There will be a difference in the proportion of time that patients spend in their therapeutic range and the amount of adverse events that occur between those who use a CoaguChek monitor and those who use standard clinic monitoring of their INR. The primary outcome will be time in therapeutic range (TTR). Secondary outcomes will be INR variability, minor / major bleeding complications and thromboembolic events.","Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and outcomes of standard clinic management and home management of INR in patients over 14 years of age with CHD and to determine which method of INR management results in a greater time in therapeutic range, less INR variability and fewer adverse events. This study will have a number of objectives as detailed below.

1. To determine whether patients who home monitor their INR or those who use standard clinic management spend more time in therapeutic range with less INR variability and have fewer adverse events.
2. To survey patient views on the ease of use, practicality and their satisfaction with their current method of INR management.
3. To examine patients overall health related quality of life (HRQoL) using RAND SF-36 survey for participants who are 18+ years and the PedsQL quality of life inventory for participants who are 14-17 years of age, and determine whether there is a difference in HRQoL between the two cohorts.
4. To undertake structured interviews with the participants' General Practitioners (GPs) to examine their views / beliefs about INR home monitoring; and to undertake semi-structured interviews with the ACHD clinical nurse specialists and the clinical research nurse (who is responsible for training patients in the use of home monitoring) to examine their views about INR home monitoring.

Experimental details and design of proposed investigation: This research will be a 1-year prospective cohort study monitoring CHD patients who are on warfarin. Recruitment of patients will be from the ACHD clinics in the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), Belfast. There are approximately 4,000 patients with CHD who attend these clinics from the age of 14 years onwards, with a proportion of these patients on warfarin therapy. Patients on warfarin will be identified by Jan Gordon (ACHD clinical nurse specialist) or Deirdre Lovell (clinical research nurse). Suitable patients who attend one of the ACHD clinics during the 6 month recruitment period will be sent a participant information leaflet at the same time as they are sent their clinic appointment letter (which is sent out two weeks prior to their appointment). Eligible participants can also be recruited from other clinics in RVH. The participant information sheet will inform them about the study and contain contact information for the PhD student, Rachel Savage, who can provide more information and explain the study further. Interested patients will have two weeks to consider their participation prior to their clinic appointment. The PhD student will attend the ACHD clinics up to three times per week for six months to explain the study and recruit patients. Dr Lockhart (Adult CHD Consultant) and Jan Gordon will support this recruitment process. Patients who agree to participate in the study will be screened for inclusion / exclusion criteria as detailed below, and if eligible be asked to provide informed consent. Inpatients who meet the eligibility criteria will be identified by a clinical member of the research team, and provided with the participant information sheet. Those who are interested in participating in the study will notify one of the clinical member of the research team, in which case the PhD student will be informed, and will attend the RVH to gain informed consent allowing at least one week to consider their participation.

There is currently a home monitoring programme at the RVH which is run by a nurse specialist who trains patients how to use their CoaguChek monitor and how to self manage their warfarin dose, following the RVH protocols regarding frequency of testing and dose adjustment. After a 4 month training period, long term follow up of these patients is undertaken by their GP. There is a proportion of ACHD patients who currently home monitor using the RVH protocols. In the event of any issues with home monitoring, patients can contact their GP or one of the ACHD clinical nurse specialists for advice. The patients who currently home monitor will have chosen to home monitor and will either have purchased the CoaguChek monitor themselves, or will have received a monitor which has been funded by Children's Heartbeat Trust, who provide funding for 15 new monitors for ACHD patients per year.

Data Collection: Patients in both cohorts will be asked to submit an electronic INR record, which includes their INR level, warfarin dose, acute illnesses, changes in medications and any warfarin-related adverse events e.g. minor / major bleeding and thromboembolic events, as per normal practice. Acute illnesses and changes in medications are potential covariates and will be included in covariate analysis. Additionally alcohol intake is a potential covariate, which will be recorded at recruitment. An email and/or text message will be sent to all participants at the end of each month to remind them to submit their INR record electronically to Rachel Savage. Participants in the home monitoring cohort will be invited to attend the RVH at 6 months and at the end of the 12 months to have their INR data downloaded from their CoaguChek monitor. Data for the standard clinic monitoring cohort will also be obtained at 6 months and again at 12 months, from the participants' electronic health record (ECR), by either the clinical research nurse or one of the ACHD clinical nurse specialists within the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. In cases of suspected CVA, the CT/MRI will be reviewed by a Consultant Radiologist as per normal clinical practice.

At the end of the twelve month follow up period all participants will be asked to complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire, which will evaluate the ease of use, practicality and their satisfaction with the method of INR management they use. Questions will include, but are not limited to the following: indication for warfarin therapy, INR target range, duration of warfarin therapy, history of blood clots/stroke/TIA, history of INR levels \<1.5 or \>8 and how often their INR is checked. A link to the patient questionnaire will be sent electronically to all participants at the end of the study.

Participants who are 18+ years will be asked to complete a health related quality of life (HRQoL) survey RAND SF-36, to determine whether home management of INR affects quality of life. A link to the HRQoL survey will be sent electronically to all participants who are 18+ years at the end of the 12 month follow up period. For participants who are 14-17 years, the PedsQL inventory will be used, which is a validated, disease-specific questionnaire for use by paediatric patients. At the end of the twelve month follow up period, an electronic link to the PedsQL inventory will be sent to participants who are 14-17 years.

Each participant's General Practitioner (GP) will be invited to take part in structured interviews to examine their views / beliefs regarding INR home monitoring. If there is a GP in the practice who specializes in warfarin monitoring, this GP will also be invited to take part in structured interviews. The aim of the interviews is to determine GP's views on INR monitoring and to examine whether GP preferences influence the method of INR monitoring that patients choose. The participant information sheet and consent form will be sent to each GP along with the letter informing them that their patient is participating in the cohort study. If a GP consents to participate in a structured interview, the PhD student will arrange a suitable time and/or venue to conduct the interviews either face to face or via telephone. All interviews will be audio recorded.

The ACHD clinical nurse specialists and the clinical research nurse responsible for training patients how to home monitor will be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews, which will take place face to face. The aim of these interviews is to determine the views and preferences of clinical nurses on INR monitoring and to examine whether these preferences influence the method of INR monitoring that patients choose. A participant information sheet will be given to the nurses during the 6 month recruitment period of the ACHD participants. All interviews will be audio recorded.

Data Analysis: Patient reported INR results will be cross-referenced with INR results downloaded from the CoaguChek monitor (home monitoring cohort) or the participants' electronic health record (clinic monitoring cohort), and data will be input into SPSS for analysis. To determine if there are differences in patient characteristics between cohorts, categories such as gender, age, indication for warfarin therapy as well as levels of education, work and income will be compared. Normality will be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables such as number of adverse events will be displayed as frequency/percentages and statistical significance will be determined using chi-square. Continuous variables such as time in therapeutic range will be displayed as mean ± SD and statistical significance will be determined using t-test. Covariates such as alcohol intake, acute illnesses and changes in medications will be analyzed using ANCOVA.","Home monitoring cohort

The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and outcomes of standard clinic management and home management of INR in patients with CHD. Analysis of time in therapeutic range (TTR), INR variability, major and minor bleeding events, incidence of CVA and other thrombotic events will be undertaken. Original Hypothesis: There will be a difference in the proportion of time that patients spend in their therapeutic range and the amount of adverse events that occur between those who use a CoaguChek monitor and those who use standard clinic monitoring of their INR. The primary outcome will be time in therapeutic range (TTR). Secondary outcomes will be INR variability, minor / major bleeding complications and thromboembolic events. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and outcomes of standard clinic management and home management of INR in patients over 14 years of age with CHD and to determine which method of INR management results in a greater time in therapeutic range, less INR variability and fewer adverse events. This study will have a number of objectives as detailed below. 1. To determine whether patients who home monitor their INR or those who use standard clinic management spend more time in therapeutic range with less INR variability and have fewer adverse events. 2. To survey patient views on the ease of use, practicality and their satisfaction with their current method of INR management. 3. To examine patients overall health related quality of life (HRQoL) using RAND SF-36 survey for participants who are 18+ years and the PedsQL quality of life inventory for participants who are 14-17 years of age, and determine whether there is a difference in HRQoL between the two cohorts. 4. To undertake structured interviews with the participants' General Practitioners (GPs) to examine their views / beliefs about INR home monitoring; and to undertake semi-structured interviews with the ACHD clinical nurse specialists and the clinical research nurse (who is responsible for training patients in the use of home monitoring) to examine their views about INR home monitoring. Experimental details and design of proposed investigation: This research will be a 1-year prospective cohort study monitoring CHD patients who are on warfarin. Recruitment of patients will be from the ACHD clinics in the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), Belfast. There are approximately 4,000 patients with CHD who attend these clinics from the age of 14 years onwards, with a proportion of these patients on warfarin therapy. Patients on warfarin will be identified by Jan Gordon (ACHD clinical nurse specialist) or Deirdre Lovell (clinical research nurse). Suitable patients who attend one of the ACHD clinics during the 6 month recruitment period will be sent a participant information leaflet at the same time as they are sent their clinic appointment letter (which is sent out two weeks prior to their appointment). Eligible participants can also be recruited from other clinics in RVH. The participant information sheet will inform them about the study and contain contact information for the PhD student, Rachel Savage, who can provide more information and explain the study further. Interested patients will have two weeks to consider their participation prior to their clinic appointment. The PhD student will attend the ACHD clinics up to three times per week for six months to explain the study and recruit patients. Dr Lockhart (Adult CHD Consultant) and Jan Gordon will support this recruitment process. Patients who agree to participate in the study will be screened for inclusion / exclusion criteria as detailed below, and if eligible be asked to provide informed consent. Inpatients who meet the eligibility criteria will be identified by a clinical member of the research team, and provided with the participant information sheet. Those who are interested in participating in the study will notify one of the clinical member of the research team, in which case the PhD student will be informed, and will attend the RVH to gain informed consent allowing at least one week to consider their participation. There is currently a home monitoring programme at the RVH which is run by a nurse specialist who trains patients how to use their CoaguChek monitor and how to self manage their warfarin dose, following the RVH protocols regarding frequency of testing and dose adjustment. After a 4 month training period, long term follow up of these patients is undertaken by their GP. There is a proportion of ACHD patients who currently home monitor using the RVH protocols. In the event of any issues with home monitoring, patients can contact their GP or one of the ACHD clinical nurse specialists for advice. The patients who currently home monitor will have chosen to home monitor and will either have purchased the CoaguChek monitor themselves, or will have received a monitor which has been funded by Children's Heartbeat Trust, who provide funding for 15 new monitors for ACHD patients per year. Data Collection: Patients in both cohorts will be asked to submit an electronic INR record, which includes their INR level, warfarin dose, acute illnesses, changes in medications and any warfarin-related adverse events e.g. minor / major bleeding and thromboembolic events, as per normal practice. Acute illnesses and changes in medications are potential covariates and will be included in covariate analysis. Additionally alcohol intake is a potential covariate, which will be recorded at recruitment. An email and/or text message will be sent to all participants at the end of each month to remind them to submit their INR record electronically to Rachel Savage. Participants in the home monitoring cohort will be invited to attend the RVH at 6 months and at the end of the 12 months to have their INR data downloaded from their CoaguChek monitor. Data for the standard clinic monitoring cohort will also be obtained at 6 months and again at 12 months, from the participants' electronic health record (ECR), by either the clinical research nurse or one of the ACHD clinical nurse specialists within the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. In cases of suspected CVA, the CT/MRI will be reviewed by a Consultant Radiologist as per normal clinical practice. At the end of the twelve month follow up period all participants will be asked to complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire, which will evaluate the ease of use, practicality and their satisfaction with the method of INR management they use. Questions will include, but are not limited to the following: indication for warfarin therapy, INR target range, duration of warfarin therapy, history of blood clots/stroke/TIA, history of INR levels \<1.5 or \>8 and how often their INR is checked. A link to the patient questionnaire will be sent electronically to all participants at the end of the study. Participants who are 18+ years will be asked to complete a health related quality of life (HRQoL) survey RAND SF-36, to determine whether home management of INR affects quality of life. A link to the HRQoL survey will be sent electronically to all participants who are 18+ years at the end of the 12 month follow up period. For participants who are 14-17 years, the PedsQL inventory will be used, which is a validated, disease-specific questionnaire for use by paediatric patients. At the end of the twelve month follow up period, an electronic link to the PedsQL inventory will be sent to participants who are 14-17 years. Each participant's General Practitioner (GP) will be invited to take part in structured interviews to examine their views / beliefs regarding INR home monitoring. If there is a GP in the practice who specializes in warfarin monitoring, this GP will also be invited to take part in structured interviews. The aim of the interviews is to determine GP's views on INR monitoring and to examine whether GP preferences influence the method of INR monitoring that patients choose. The participant information sheet and consent form will be sent to each GP along with the letter informing them that their patient is participating in the cohort study. If a GP consents to participate in a structured interview, the PhD student will arrange a suitable time and/or venue to conduct the interviews either face to face or via telephone. All interviews will be audio recorded. The ACHD clinical nurse specialists and the clinical research nurse responsible for training patients how to home monitor will be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews, which will take place face to face. The aim of these interviews is to determine the views and preferences of clinical nurses on INR monitoring and to examine whether these preferences influence the method of INR monitoring that patients choose. A participant information sheet will be given to the nurses during the 6 month recruitment period of the ACHD participants. All interviews will be audio recorded. Data Analysis: Patient reported INR results will be cross-referenced with INR results downloaded from the CoaguChek monitor (home monitoring cohort) or the participants' electronic health record (clinic monitoring cohort), and data will be input into SPSS for analysis. To determine if there are differences in patient characteristics between cohorts, categories such as gender, age, indication for warfarin therapy as well as levels of education, work and income will be compared. Normality will be tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables such as number of adverse events will be displayed as frequency/percentages and statistical significance will be determined using chi-square. Continuous variables such as time in therapeutic range will be displayed as mean ± SD and statistical significance will be determined using t-test. Covariates such as alcohol intake, acute illnesses and changes in medications will be analyzed using ANCOVA.

Threshold Pharmaceuticals,INDUSTRY,NCT00743379,Dose-Escalation Study of TH-302 in Combination With A) Gemcitabine or B) Docetaxel or C) Pemetrexed to Treat Advanced Solid Tumors,"A Phase 1/2, Multicenter, Dose-Escalation Study to Determine the Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of TH-302 in Combination With A) Gemcitabine or B) Docetaxel or C) Pemetrexed in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors","The purpose of this study is to determine if TH-302, in combination with A) Gemcitabine, or B) Docetaxel or C) Pemetrexed methotrexate, are safe and effective in the treatment of Pancreatic Cancer, Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer, and Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, respectively.","A broad range of tumors have been shown to contain significant numbers of hypoxic cells and hypoxia has been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis and an increase in resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Brizel 1997, Vaupel 2007, Shannon 2003).

It is likely that an agent that could effectively target hypoxic regions in tumors would improve efficacy when combined with standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy. TH-302 is activated at lower oxygen concentrations than other bioreductive prodrugs (Duan 2008) and tirapazamine, a hypoxic cytotoxin that has been extensively studied in both preclinical and clinical studies. This should result in an improved therapeutic ratio (tumor vs normal tissue toxicity) as compared with other bioreductive agents. Because TH-302 is expected to be minimally toxic to aerobic cancer cells, optimal efficacy would be expected when TH-302 is combined with treatments that are most effective under aerobic conditions such as radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Preclinical data have shown at least additive efficacy when TH-302 is combined with either docetaxel or gemcitabine. In order to minimize the risk of additive toxicity, TH-302 is not being evaluated in combination with alkylating agents.","Gemcitabine + TH-302 Inclusion Criteria:

A broad range of tumors have been shown to contain significant numbers of hypoxic cells and hypoxia has been shown to be associated with a poor prognosis and an increase in resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Brizel 1997, Vaupel 2007, Shannon 2003). It is likely that an agent that could effectively target hypoxic regions in tumors would improve efficacy when combined with standard chemotherapy or radiotherapy. TH-302 is activated at lower oxygen concentrations than other bioreductive prodrugs (Duan 2008) and tirapazamine, a hypoxic cytotoxin that has been extensively studied in both preclinical and clinical studies. This should result in an improved therapeutic ratio (tumor vs normal tissue toxicity) as compared with other bioreductive agents. Because TH-302 is expected to be minimally toxic to aerobic cancer cells, optimal efficacy would be expected when TH-302 is combined with treatments that are most effective under aerobic conditions such as radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Preclinical data have shown at least additive efficacy when TH-302 is combined with either docetaxel or gemcitabine. In order to minimize the risk of additive toxicity, TH-302 is not being evaluated in combination with alkylating agents. Gemcitabine + TH-302 Inclusion Criteria: 1. At least 18 years of age 2.

Yale University,OTHER,NCT03262779,Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in Patients With Anti-PD-1-axis Therapy-resistant Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,A Phase II Study of Combination Immunotherapy With Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Resistant to Anti-PD-1-axis Therapy,The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab after primary or acquired resistance to anti- programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis therapy can lead to objective radiographic tumor regression.,"Approximately 20 percent of unselected patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and progression during or after standard first line chemotherapy will experience tumor response to nivolumab. Treatment options for patients who are not responsive to programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis inhibitor therapy are limited, and the mechanisms of primary resistance are poorly understood.

The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently FDA approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma based on superiority to either agent alone5. The results of a phase I study evaluating combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced NSCLC (NCT01454102) were presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in 20166. Dosing of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks yielded an objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 of 39%, with one-year survival rate of 69% and grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse event rate of 33%. These results prompted an ongoing phase III study comparing this regimen to standard first line chemotherapy, nivolumab monotherapy or combination therapy with chemotherapy and nivolumab for patients with advanced NSCLC (NCT02477826).

The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab after primary resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy can lead to objective radiographic tumor regression. It is hypothesized that ipilimumab will enable more effective immune priming in some patients, resulting in the trafficking of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells to the tumor, as well as depletion of tumor-permissive T regulatory cells. With concurrent nivolumab, PD-1 inhibition in the tumor will enable effective anti-tumor attack by tumor-specific T cells. Serial tumor biopsies and blood collections will allow interrogation of changes in the tumor microenvironment (and periphery) that support this hypothesis.

The investigators will primarily enroll patients who have experienced progression of NSCLC after anti-PD-1- axis therapy without initial response to such therapy ('primary resistance'). A smaller cohort of patients with acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy (i.e. progression after initial response) will additionally be accrued.

The study record was updated to add individual arms for those with primary resistance and acquired resistance. The intent of the study is not to compare these treatment arms.","Inclusion Criteria

A. Signed Informed Consent B. Ability to comply with the protocol C. Age ≥18 years D. Histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic (i.e., Stage IIIB not eligible for definitive chemoradiotherapy, Stage IV, or recurrent) NSCLC (per the American Joint Committee /AJCC staging system) E. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 F. Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions can be counted as target lesions if clearly progressing after radiation.

G. Chemotherapy-naive and treated patients will be eligible, with no limit on number of prior therapies. Patients with NSCLC known to harbor an ALK rearrangement, or EGFR mutation known to be sensitive to FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), are only eligible after experiencing disease progression (during or after treatment) or intolerance to an FDA approved EGFR TKI or ALK TKI, respectively.

1. Patients with TKI-treated EGFR mutant NSCLC harboring the secondary EGFR T790M tumor must have received prior osimertinib
2. Patients with crizotinib-treated ALK rearranged NSCLC must have received a next generation ALK inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib, alectinib or brigatinib) H. Prior palliative radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug.

I. Anti- PD-1 Axis therapy (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) must be the most recent systemic anti-tumor treatment received in all patients, with documented progressive disease. Last administration of anti-PD-1 axis therapy must have been at least 3 weeks before the first dose of study drug.

a. Patients to be enrolled to the primary cohort (primary resistance) must have had progressive disease or stable disease less than 24 weeks as the best clinical response to anti-PD-1-axis monotherapy b. Patients to be enrolled to the exploratory cohort (acquired resistance) must have had stable disease for at least 24 weeks, partial response, or complete response as the best clinical response to anti-PD-1-axis monotherapy, with subsequent progression of disease J. At least one tumor amenable to incisional, excisional, core or forceps (transbronchial) biopsy. Patients must be willing to undergo tumor biopsies before starting trial therapy, and 9 to 10 weeks after initiation of therapy.

a. If the initial biopsy will be excisional, the excised tumor cannot be counted as a target lesion and there must be another lesion amenable to incisional, excisional, core or forceps biopsy. In this scenario, the second biopsy can only be excisional if the lesion to be excised is not a target lesion. b. Cytology tumor specimens (e.g. from fine-needle biopsies, or drainage of pleural/ pericardial or ascites fluid) are not acceptable. Biopsies of bone lesions that do not have a soft tissue component are also not acceptable (i.e. decalcified tumor samples are not acceptable).

K. For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use a highly effective form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate \[\<1% per year\] when used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 6 months after the last dose of trial therapy. Highly effective contraception is one with a failure rate of \<0.1%. Birth control pills on their own do not achieve that rate.

1. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 72 hours of the start of study drug administration
2. Women who have recently given birth must no longer be breastfeeding

L. Adequate hematologic and end-organ function, defined by the following laboratory results obtained within 14 days prior to the first study treatment:

Patients must be willing to undergo tumor biopsies before starting trial therapy, and 9 to 10 weeks after initiation of therapy. a. If the initial biopsy will be excisional, the excised tumor cannot be counted as a target lesion and there must be another lesion amenable to incisional, excisional, core or forceps biopsy. In this scenario, the second biopsy can only be excisional if the lesion to be excised is not a target lesion. b. Cytology tumor specimens (e.g. from fine-needle biopsies, or drainage of pleural/ pericardial or ascites fluid) are not acceptable.

"National Academy of Medical Sciences, Nepal",OTHER_GOV,NCT06482879,Comparison of Hypoxia Between HFNC and SNC in Patient Undergoing UGI Endoscopic Procedures in Deep Sedation,Comparison of Hypoxia Between High Flow Nasal Canula and Simple Nasal Canula in Patient Undergoing Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Procedures in Deep Sedation,"Hypoxia frequently occurs as a complication during upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures performed under deep sedation. Traditional oxygen delivery methods, such as the simple nasal cannula, are commonly used to prevent hypoxia in these cases. The high-flow nasal cannula, capable of delivering FiO2 levels of up to 1 and flow rates of up to 70 l/min, offers additional benefits, including positive end-expiratory pressure and reduced dead space. We hypothesized is that the use of high-flow nasal cannula can decrease the incidence of hypoxia in comparison to simple nasal cannula in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures under deep sedation.

This was prospective, comparative observational study conducted in a tertiary care center of Nepal with the primary objective to compare the rates of hypoxia (SpO2 \< 92%) and secondary objectives were to compare interruption of procedure due to hypoxia, minimum hypoxia level and episodes of hypoxia between high flow nasal canula (flow rate of 30l/min with FiO2 of 0.5) and simple nasal canula (flow rate of 6l/min) in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures in semi-prone position in deep sedation using propofol infusion.

The study comprised 125 participants, 58 in simple nasal canula and 67 in high flow nasal cannula group. The incidence of hypoxia in simple nasal cannula and high flow nasal cannula groups, with rates of 37.3% (22/58) and 16.4% (11/67), respectively. The relative risk (RR) of hypoxia was 0.43 (95% CI: 0.23-0.81), with a p-value of 0.009. Procedural interruptions due to hypoxia occurred in 8.6% (5/58) of participants in the simple nasal cannula group and 4.47% (3/67) in the high flow nasal cannula group, with RR of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.02-1.41) and a p-value 0.1. Furthermore, the occurrence of multiple episodes of hypoxia was higher in the simple nasal cannula group compared to the high flow nasal cannula group (5 vs. 0), with a p-value \< 0.001.The use of high flow nasal cannula reduces the occurrence of hypoxia in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures with deep sedation compared to simple nasal cannula.","This study was prospective, comparative, open-label and observational study conducted on tertiary hospital of Nepal between July 2023-April 2024.A written informed consent was taken from all the patients before enrolling to study.

Patient not willing to enrolled, pre-operative SPO2 \< 92% and pre-operative MAP \< 60 mm Hg were excluded from study. Sixty-two patients were enrolled in each group so total sample size was 124 using following sample size formula. .

After arriving in the procedure room, standard monitoring, including pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, and electrocardiography were attached. An anesthesiologist assigned made the decision on which oxygenation device to use for the patient. In SNC group, an oxygen flow rate of 6 l/min where in HFNC group at the beginning of procedure flow was set 10 l/min once patient was induced flow rate increased to 30 l/min with FiO2 of 0.5. The patients were positioned either laterally or semiprone. Prior to the start of the procedure, the patient was given an injection of fentanyl 1mcg/kg. An initial dose of propofol was administered at a rate of 1-1.5 mg/kg by slow titrating manner. The sedation level, ventilatory pattern,rate and depth were clinically monitored throughout the procedure.The propofol infusion was kept between 25-150 mcg/kg/min, aiming for preventing facial grimace, agitation, or gag reflex, while still allowing the patient to respond to painful stimuli. In case of any sings of agitation noticed, the anaesthesiologist added the additional dose of propofol or increase the propofol infusion rate or both, as in our usual practice.

In SNC group, if SpO2 decreased below 92%, flow rate increased to 8 l/min whereas in HFNC group FiO2 increased to 1 and flow rate increased to 50 l/min. If desaturation continued despite of above mentioned measure in both groups, anesthesiologist increased the FiO2, flow or both. Bag mask ventilation and tracheal intubation was done if needed. Other events; bradycardia needing atropine, hypotension needing vasopressor, persistent hypoxia needing bag and mask, endotracheal intubation was recorded.

The secondary objectives are to correlate the dominant metabolic dependencies of TNBCs with pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy, and with the cancers' molecular signaling pathways assessed via NGS and RPPA.","One of the recognized hallmarks of cancer cells is deregulated cellular metabolism, characterized by enhanced metabolic autonomy compare with non-transformed cells. Tumor cells typically display an overall increase in glucose metabolism, associated with enhanced aerobic glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by a requirement for a high rate of protein, nucleotide, and fatty acid synthesis to provide the raw materials for cell division. 13C-glucose is a non-radioactive stable isotope tracer that has been widely used in vitro, in vivo, and in patients in a variety of disease settings to study glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, at steady state and following intervention. \[1,2-13C\] glucose can provide additional information on the activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway versus glycolysis. Administration of intravenous 13C-glucose is a convenient and affordable approach to analyzing the metabolomics of human cancers in their native microenvironments.

The metabolic dependencies of the various breast cancer subtypes are poorly understood. Importantly, in depth analyses of the in situ metabolic processes utilized by triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) using state-of-the-art in vivo \[1,2-13C\]-glucose infusions in patients with TNBC has never been done. In TNBC, oncogenic activation of key signaling pathways leads to altered metabolic programming resulting in an increased dependence on exogenous nutrients such as glucose and glutamine. These data further suggest a hypothesis that TNBCs may employ a cellular mechanism called macropinocytosis to ingest and degrade interstitial albumin to accumulate glutamine. This process may then be exploited for therapeutic gain through enhanced uptake by cells that utilize macropinocytosis to meet their metabolic requirements.

In this study, administration of \[1,2-13C\]-glucose to patients with TNBC will be done prior to patients undergoing a biopsy of their breast cancer as well as blood sample collection which will allow for in depth evaluation of glycolysis as well as lipid and amino acid metabolism by Joshua Rabinowitz, PhD, at Princeton University who is an international expert in cancer metabolomics.

To select patients at higher risk for PE, multiparametric assessment combining maternal history, biochemical factors and biophysical factors should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Multiparametric risk assessments have a detection rate for early-onset PE around 80% at a false positive rate of 10%. Owing to the low prevalence of early-onset and preterm PE, more than 90% of patients considered at high risk, at the first-trimester screening, will not eventually develop PE.

IRCCS San Raffaele Roma,OTHER,NCT04294979,Exercise Therapy in Multiple Sclerosis,"Study on the Interaction Between Immune, Autonomic and Central Nervous Systems as a Target of Exercise Therapy in Multiple Sclerosis","Exercise or active rehabilitation is a non-pharmacological approach increasingly used for people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), in support of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), with the aim of improving the quality of life and engagement in daily activities. Exercise improves several disease outcomes, like cardiovascular and neuromuscular functions and walking abilities. However, its disease modifying potential is poorly explored. Exercise might target two relevant disease hallmarks that are interconnected, such as the dysregulated immune system and the inflammatory synaptopathy. Exercise might act through the activation of the autonomic part of the vagus nerve, which is an important modulator of both the innate and adaptive immune system, through the so-called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway-CAP.

This study aims to address the effect of exercise in reducing peripheral inflammation that drives the synaptic pathology and neurodegeneration occurring in the brain of MS patients. Patients will undergo a therapeutic exercise program, consisting of 3 hours of treatment per day, 6 days/week for a total of 6 weeks. The treatment will include both passive and active therapeutic exercises targeted to restore or preserve muscular flexibility, motor coordination and ambulatory function. The day of recruitment (time 0) patients will undergo neurological and mood examination and blood withdrawal to analyze peripheral markers of immune function. Moreover, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used to measure synaptic transmission, while the heart rate variability (HRV) test will be performed to explore vagal function. The effect of exercise will be evaluated at the end of rehabilitation (after 6 weeks-time 1), on the above parameters. A follow up will be included (time 2, 8 weeks after the end of the treatment) to address long-term effects on neurologic and mood measurements as well as peripheral marker levels.","Clinical manifestations of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) indicate the involvement of motor, sensory, visual systems, cognition and emotion, as well as peripheral autonomic system (PAS). Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) are immunomodulatory drugs designed to dampen the immune reaction occurring in MS. Indeed, MS pathogenesis is supposed to rely on the break of immunological tolerance against myelin epitopes, which trigger an inflammatory cascade that leads to chronic inflammation, axonal loss and neurodegeneration. T cell population in MS presents several metabolic dysfunctions, such as glycolysis alterations that can be attenuated by DMTs. Studies of synaptic transmission conducted on both MS patients, via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and EAE mice, via electrophysiological recordings of single neurons, showed an early synaptopathy characterized by an impairment of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmissions. Such synaptopathy is independent of demyelination and caused by inflammation. Importantly, TMS cortical excitability measures positively correlate with disability in MS patients. Moreover, chimeric experiments obtained incubating MS T cells and murine brain slices, clearly indicate that T cells drive synaptic damage during MS, suggesting that interfering with T cell-neuron crosstalk could be a possible therapeutic target.

Due to the complexity and the heterogeneity of the disease course and the clinical symptoms, the search for the appropriate personalized treatment and the disease management remains a challenging issue. It is increasingly recognized that a multi-disciplinary approach in MS treatment, including non-pharmacological interventions is required to treat MS. Active-rehabilitation or exercise has been proven effective in the improvement of cardiovascular functions, aerobic capacity, muscular strength and ambulatory performance, while some data indicate that other outcomes, like balance and depression can be positively influenced by exercise. Symptoms of sympathovagal imbalance, like altered heart rate variability (HRV), previously shown to depend on inflammatory bulk in MS, may be positively modulated by exercise, which is known to regulate both the peripheral nervous system and the immune system. However, the mechanisms involved in exercise-beneficial effects as well as the impact of exercise on MS pathophysiological hallmarks, especially those regarding the immune-synaptic axis, are still poorly elucidated.

This longitudinal, interventional, non-pharmacological study is designed to enrol 44 MS patients and 30 healthy controls matched by gender and age to the MS group. The MS patient group will undergo a conventional 6-week rehabilitation program. Physical therapy will be performed for 6 days/week for 6 weeks and will consist of 3 hours of treatment per day. The rehabilitation program will be planned by a physician specialized in physical and rehabilitation medicine and will consist of both passive and active therapeutic exercises specifically aimed at restoring or maintaining muscular flexibility, range of motion, balance, coordination of movements, postural passages and transfers, and ambulation. According to the patient's disability status, different therapeutic exercises will be performed by qualified physiotherapists. Intensity of exercise will be tailored to the level of patient's disability. Furthermore, advanced robotic therapy such as Lokomat® exoskeleton (Hocoma AG, Volketswil, Switzerland), Biodex® Stability System (BSS, Biodex, Inc, Shirley, NY), G-EO System™ (Reha Technology AG, Olten, Svizzera) and Indego® Therapy (Parker USA), will be used to standardize rehabilitation treatment and obtain more objective indices of motor function and will be applied according to clinical indications. Three time-points (t) of evaluations are included in the study: t0 (before starting the rehabilitation period), t1 (soon after rehabilitation) and t2 (follow-up, after 8 weeks by the end of rehabilitation). Therapeutic efficacy will be evaluated at the end of the exercise program (t1) by repeating evaluations performed at t0, which include neurological and psychological assessments, together with measures of brain synaptic activity and vagal function and immune function. At t2, analysis will be limited to neurological and psychological assessments and immune function. Thus, blood samples will be collected at t0, t1 and t2 to study changes in immune function that might correlate with clinical parameters described as primary and secondary outcomes at the different time-points.

Statistical analysis will be performed by IBM SPSS Statistics 15.0. Data will be tested for normality distribution through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences between pre- and post-values will be analyzed using parametric Student's t-test for matched pairs, or if necessary, nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched pairs. Changes in categorical variables will be assessed by McNemar test. Correlation analysis will be performed by calculating Pearson or Spearman coefficients as appropriate. Changes in categorical variables will be evaluated by the test McNemar. Data will be presented as the mean (standard deviation, sd) or median (25th- 75th percentile). The significance level is established at p\<0.05.

Sample size calculation was performed according to the following criteria. Assuming that in MS patients the cytokine values in particular the TNF level after exercise therapy decrease in a manner similar to that showed in the study by Hedegaard et al (2008). Based on these results, calculating an average difference between pre and post exercise values of TNF equal to 1365.1 pg / ml (sd = 2570), d = 0.53, in order to appreciate a moderate effect with a statistical capacity of 95% and assuming a two-tailed a = 0.05 and applying a Wilcoxon rank test for paired values, the investigators estimate a total number of patients equal to 40. Analysis was performed with the G \* POWER v3.1.9.2 program. Considering possible drop-outs, the investigators estimate to increase the number of patients recruited by one percentage equal to 10%, meaning 4 subjects. Moreover, using Power Analysis d=0.61, it has been calculated that the number of healthy volunteer subjects needed to be recruited for the study of the immunophenotype and secretoma will be 30 subjects per experimental group, in order to be able to refuse the null hypothesis that the two groups are equal with a test power of 95% and appreciate a difference of 1600.9 pg / ml between the means of the experimental groups (healthy control vs MS) (standard deviation equal to 2599), d = 0.61. The probability of Type I error associated with this test for this hypothesis is 5%.","Inclusion Criteria:

The application of tape to injured soft tissues and joints provides support and protection for these structures. Many different techniques are used for injury prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, proprioception and sport. Elastic adhesive tape may be used to unload Myofacial Trigger Points (MTrPs), A trigger point can be located in fascia, ligaments, muscles, and tendons; however, MTrPs are also found in skeletal muscles and/or their fascia. An MTrP is a hyperirritable spot, associated with a taut band of a skeletal muscle that is painful on compression or stretch, and that can give rise to a typical referred pain pattern as well as autonomic phenomena. The use of tape along muscle to unload affected soft tissue seems to be effective in the treatment of trigger points by inhibiting overactive muscle, changing the orientation of fascia and a proprioceptive effect. The purpose of study was to determine the efficacy of Kinesio taping application on trigger point of piriformis muscle.","Piriformis syndrome is a peripheral neuritis of the sciatic nerve caused by an abnormal condition of the piriformis muscle. Some investigators consider it as a form of Myofacial pain syndrome which defined as the presence of exquisite tenderness at a nodule in a palpable taut band of muscle. Trigger points are able to produce referred pain, either spontaneously or on digital compression. Although myofascial trigger points are a widely recognized phenomenon in clinical practice, there remains much to be elucidated with regards to their pathophysiology. Conservative pharmacotherapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), muscle relaxants, and physical therapy modalities such as heat therapy, cold therapy, ultrasound, electrical current and stretching were traditionally used in the treatment of trigger points.

The utilization of Kinesio taping regarding to the proposed mechanisms including 1) restoring correct muscle function by supporting weakened muscles, (2) reducing congestion by improving the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid, (3) decreasing pain by stimulating neurological system, and (4) correcting misaligned joints by retrieving muscle spasm (5) enhancing proprioception through increased stimulation to cutaneous mechanoreceptors can be helpful in restoring muscle function in patients with Myofacial trigger points .

Grupo Español de Rehabilitación Multimodal,OTHER,NCT04799379,Microporous Polysaccharide Hemospheres (MPH) Improving Outcome After Rectal Surgery,Evaluation of Microporous Polysaccharide Hemospheres (MPH) Agent in Preventing Postoperative Complications After Rectal Surgery (EPHAS Study).,"Multi-center, prospective, cohort study, of patients scheduled for elective rectal surgery who received absorbable hemostatic powder to assess whether it can improve patient postoperative outcomes, reduce usage of drains and prove to be cost-effective. This cohort will be compared to a previously studied cohort using drains (Power and IMPRICA study) with comparable patient characteristics.

The primary endpoint of the study is: postoperative pelvic sepsis within 60 postoperative days including anastomotic leakage, pelvic abscess and peritonitis.

Secondary endpoints: postoperative morbidities, rate of reoperation and length of hospitalization.","Multimodal surgical rehabilitation, also known as Enhanced Recovery After Surgery, entails the application of a series of perioperative procedure measures and strategies aimed at patients who are going to undergo a surgical procedure with the objective of reducing secondary stress caused by the surgical intervention and thus achieve enhanced recovery of the patient and decrease complications and mortality.

ERAS protocols are care programs based on scientific evidence, encompassing all aspects of patient care and requiring multidisciplinary management, with the participation of diverse specialists1. Starting at the diagnosis, their aim is to recognize patients' individual needs to optimize their treatment before, during and after surgery. The close collaboration of all specialists participating in the process, as well as of the actual patients and their relatives has proved to be essential.

The Multimodal Rehabilitation Programmes (MRP) or Enhanced Recovery Programmes (ERAS) review traditional perioperative procedure practices, evaluating the specific key points of each type of surgery and analysing their scientific evidence. MRPs have shown, in cents that have routinely adopted them, a significant improvement in the patient's quality of life. Furthermore, MRPs significantly reducing the hospital stay and potential complications associated with hospitalisation2, being the anastomotic leak (AL) the most serious of them.

Total mesorectal excision (TME) and bowel restoration is currently the standard treatment for middle to low rectal cancer. However, TME has been shown to be associated with high anastomotic leakage with a reported incidence of up to 24%, reaching 50% when clinically silent radiographic leaks are considered3.

Despite a large number of studies in the literature that have investigated risk factors, the fundamental causes of AL remain unclear. In this sense, according to enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols4, pelvic drain should not be used routinely as it may cause patient discomfort and prolong hospitalization. Moreover, drain itself is also a potential site of infection especially if open or passive drainage system is used.

Even based in the best available evidence, ERAS protocols have important implementation problems because they have to put up with traditional attitudes. In this sense, many surgeons still advocate the use of a prophylactic pelvic drain because they believe that fluid collection in the pelvis could be a potential source of contamination and thereby weakening anastomotic integrity and healing.

In a recent study from the Spanish group GERM2, avoidance of drains was achieved only in 34.7% of patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. ERAS centres had a greater avoidance of drains vs non-ERAS centres (38.6% vs 28.3%), although most patients still received drains. More relevant, avoidance of drainage was associated with a significant reduction in moderate to severe complications.

We believe that it is more than justified to try new options that help surgeons reduce the use of drains. One of these, is the use of hemostatic agents. Some topical hemostats may theoretically be of benefit due to its claimed lymphostatic properties.

Published data for this is sparse, but some studies, have shown statistically significant reduction of fluid collection after using Arista®AH5.

Arista is a plant-based, flowable powder engineered to rapidly dehydrate blood, enhancing clotting on contact. Arista facilitates the formation of a highly resilient, natural clot within just a few minutes regardless of the patient's coagulation status. Arista® is fully absorbable within 24 to 48 hours of application, and because Arista degrades rapidly, it does not promote infection.

This study has been designed to support the working hypothesis that Arista® placed intraoperatively into the dissected pelvic area could reduce sepsis and postoperative anastomotic leakage. We choose to study Arista® for a theoretical reason: it contains microporous polysaccharide hemospheres (MPHs). MPHs not only activate the coagulation cascade but they cause tissue desiccation which presumably seals capillaries and could theoretically also seal small lymph vessels left open by electrosurgical devices.

Study assumptions: Arista spread on the pelvic floor at the end of surgery may allow to

1. close small holes and prevent fluid from penetrating into the pelvic floor, thereby avoiding AL
2. facilitate the avoidance of drains","Inclusion Criteria:

Furthermore, MRPs significantly reducing the hospital stay and potential complications associated with hospitalisation2, being the anastomotic leak (AL) the most serious of them. Total mesorectal excision (TME) and bowel restoration is currently the standard treatment for middle to low rectal cancer. However, TME has been shown to be associated with high anastomotic leakage with a reported incidence of up to 24%, reaching 50% when clinically silent radiographic leaks are considered3. Despite a large number of studies in the literature that have investigated risk factors, the fundamental causes of AL remain unclear. In this sense, according to enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols4, pelvic drain should not be used routinely as it may cause patient discomfort and prolong hospitalization. Moreover, drain itself is also a potential site of infection especially if open or passive drainage system is used. Even based in the best available evidence, ERAS protocols have important implementation problems because they have to put up with traditional attitudes. In this sense, many surgeons still advocate the use of a prophylactic pelvic drain because they believe that fluid collection in the pelvis could be a potential source of contamination and thereby weakening anastomotic integrity and healing. In a recent study from the Spanish group GERM2, avoidance of drains was achieved only in 34.7% of patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. ERAS centres had a greater avoidance of drains vs non-ERAS centres (38.6% vs 28.3%), although most patients still received drains. More relevant, avoidance of drainage was associated with a significant reduction in moderate to severe complications. We believe that it is more than justified to try new options that help surgeons reduce the use of drains. One of these, is the use of hemostatic agents. Some topical hemostats may theoretically be of benefit due to its claimed lymphostatic properties. Published data for this is sparse, but some studies, have shown statistically significant reduction of fluid collection after using Arista®AH5. Arista is a plant-based, flowable powder engineered to rapidly dehydrate blood, enhancing clotting on contact. Arista facilitates the formation of a highly resilient, natural clot within just a few minutes regardless of the patient's coagulation status. Arista® is fully absorbable within 24 to 48 hours of application, and because Arista degrades rapidly, it does not promote infection. This study has been designed to support the working hypothesis that Arista® placed intraoperatively into the dissected pelvic area could reduce sepsis and postoperative anastomotic leakage. We choose to study Arista® for a theoretical reason: it contains microporous polysaccharide hemospheres (MPHs). MPHs not only activate the coagulation cascade but they cause tissue desiccation which presumably seals capillaries and could theoretically also seal small lymph vessels left open by electrosurgical devices. Study assumptions: Arista spread on the pelvic floor at the end of surgery may allow to 1. close small holes and prevent fluid from penetrating into the pelvic floor, thereby avoiding AL 2. facilitate the avoidance of drains Inclusion Criteria: * All adult patients (aged \>18 years) with a diagnosis of malignant rectal cancer who are scheduled for radical surgery (anterior resection).

Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse. An intervention with evidence-based applications to post-traumatic stress caused by intimate partner abuse and posttraumatic growth, using web-based applications that young people are familiar with, is considered important in order to protect the physical-mental health of university students, to increase their academic success, and to ensure that they establish healthy intimate partner relationships in the future.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse.

Methods: The randomized controlled study that did not use blinding employed a 2x5 split-plot design. The universe of the study consisted of 371 student nurses. Students who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: experimental (n=17) and control (n=18). The internet-based psychosocial intervention, which was based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, was delivered individually and electronically to the students in the experimental group in eight sessions, each lasting up to 120 minutes, using videoconferencing. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PGTI) were used to measure the outcomes at the pre-test, post-test, 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up.

Discussion: The internet-based psychosocial intervention was found to be effective in reducing post-traumatic stress and experiencing post-traumatic growth in student nurses who had been exposed to partner violence with these positive effects lasting for six months. This study is one of the first web-based randomized controlled studies to address post-traumatic stress and growth together in university students who were exposed to intimate partner violence.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters the lives of many civilians and those involved in armed conflicts. Sequelae of TBI includes depression in up to 30% of cases. Appearance of depression after TBI impairs recovery and results in sub-optimal re-integration into society. Treatment of post TBI depression relies on oral medications, whose efficacy and side effect profile is sub-optimal. Exercise training is effective in spontaneous depression as a stand alone treatment and in conjunction with oral medications, and this may represent an alternative treatment option in the TBI population. Further, the pathophysiology of depression after TBI has yet to be examined with the full scientific rigor required. This project proposes to use exercise training of moderate intensity as a treatment for depression after TBI, while measuring biological markers as a way to investigate efficacy and provide insight into the pathophysiology.

Cork University Hospital,OTHER,NCT02179879,Development and Validation of Metrics Lumbar Labor Epidural Catheter Placement,Protocol for Development and Validation of Metrics for Conventional Lumbar Epidural Catheter Placement for Labor Analgesia in Obstetric Patients,"Procedural skills play an important role in anaesthetic expertise. More focused training and assessment of procedural skills will be needed in the future as training moves from an apprenticeship based training system to competency based assessment.

Currently various techniques exists to assess procedural skills of anaesthetist. For epidural catheter placement, task specific check list, global rating scales and cumulative sum techniques have been developed and validated. These techniques aim either for better qualitative outcome sacrificing objectivity or rely on self-reporting. A decrease in objectivity in turn hampers inter-rater reliability which is an essential component of a valid assessment model. Checklists type assessments force the developer to comprehensively characterize the procedure of interest and then validate the completed procedure characterization. This approach has been quantitatively shown to have higher assessment reliability levels compared to Likert-scale assessment.

The objective of the project is to develop and validate a comprehensive procedure characterization for labor epidural catheter placement. Another objective is to compare this new assessment tool with existing checklist and global rating scale for labor epidural to establish concurrent validity.5 A well-developed objective, validated procedure characterization serves as a master tool which has multiple applications. It helps to build a training programme for the procedure, allows providing metrics based feedback to trainees using simulator, helps to assess the performance of trainees and in future might be used as benchmark to allow competency based progression in the training.","Study part 1 After ethics committee approval a group of experts (n = 3 ) in conventional lumbar epidural catheter placement will be selected (an expert is defined as one who has performed more than 500 labor epidurals in preceding 5 year period). During a number of face-to-face meetings experts will identify, characterize and define the procedure. They will analyze task and identify units of behavior to be measured which constitute in a step-wise fashion how the procedure is optimally performed and deviations from optimal procedure performance as described previously. After informed consent from the patient and the anaesthetist performing the procedure, 2 video recordings of experts performing epidural and 2 video recordings of novices (defined as one who has done less than 50 epidurals) performing epidural will be recorded for detailed review during metric development meetings.

Study part 2 The developed metrics will be subjected to assessments of construct validity (a set of procedures for evaluating a testing instrument based on a degree to which the test terms identify the quality, ability or trait it was designed to measure) and concurrent validity (the evaluation in which the relationship between the test scores and the scores on the another instrument purporting to measure the same construct are related). We will also evaluated the inter-rater reliability of the metrics using i) proportion of agreement between raters, ii) correlation strength (using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient) and iii) Coefficient Alpha. After informed consent,10 experts (who are not a part of committee developing the metrics) each performing one or more lumbar epidural catheter placements for labor and 10 novices each performing one or more lumbar epidural catheter placements for labor will be video recorded. Two experts will review the video recording and score the performance based on checklist based system developed and compare with likert-scale checklists/global rating scale system.","Inclusion Criteria:

More focused training and assessment of procedural skills will be needed in the future as training moves from an apprenticeship based training system to competency based assessment. Currently various techniques exists to assess procedural skills of anaesthetist. For epidural catheter placement, task specific check list, global rating scales and cumulative sum techniques have been developed and validated. These techniques aim either for better qualitative outcome sacrificing objectivity or rely on self-reporting. A decrease in objectivity in turn hampers inter-rater reliability which is an essential component of a valid assessment model. Checklists type assessments force the developer to comprehensively characterize the procedure of interest and then validate the completed procedure characterization. This approach has been quantitatively shown to have higher assessment reliability levels compared to Likert-scale assessment. The objective of the project is to develop and validate a comprehensive procedure characterization for labor epidural catheter placement. Another objective is to compare this new assessment tool with existing checklist and global rating scale for labor epidural to establish concurrent validity.5 A well-developed objective, validated procedure characterization serves as a master tool which has multiple applications. It helps to build a training programme for the procedure, allows providing metrics based feedback to trainees using simulator, helps to assess the performance of trainees and in future might be used as benchmark to allow competency based progression in the training. Study part 1 After ethics committee approval a group of experts (n = 3 ) in conventional lumbar epidural catheter placement will be selected (an expert is defined as one who has performed more than 500 labor epidurals in preceding 5 year period). During a number of face-to-face meetings experts will identify, characterize and define the procedure. They will analyze task and identify units of behavior to be measured which constitute in a step-wise fashion how the procedure is optimally performed and deviations from optimal procedure performance as described previously. After informed consent from the patient and the anaesthetist performing the procedure, 2 video recordings of experts performing epidural and 2 video recordings of novices (defined as one who has done less than 50 epidurals) performing epidural will be recorded for detailed review during metric development meetings. Study part 2 The developed metrics will be subjected to assessments of construct validity (a set of procedures for evaluating a testing instrument based on a degree to which the test terms identify the quality, ability or trait it was designed to measure) and concurrent validity (the evaluation in which the relationship between the test scores and the scores on the another instrument purporting to measure the same construct are related). We will also evaluated the inter-rater reliability of the metrics using i) proportion of agreement between raters, ii) correlation strength (using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient) and iii) Coefficient Alpha. After informed consent,10 experts (who are not a part of committee developing the metrics) each performing one or more lumbar epidural catheter placements for labor and 10 novices each performing one or more lumbar epidural catheter placements for labor will be video recorded. Two experts will review the video recording and score the performance based on checklist based system developed and compare with likert-scale checklists/global rating scale system.

Therefore, it is relevant to identify alternative stress relief strategies that are devoid of these unwanted drawbacks. Moreover, the effects of such alternative interventions should be objectively quantified by means of reliable psychobiological parameters.

The goal of this study was to quantify the acute and persistent effects of a cosmetic routine based on the self-administration of a cream (DAVC) enriched with essential oils, namely Juniperus Phoenicea gum extract, Copaifera Officinalis resin, Aniba Rosodora wood oil, Juniperus Virginiana. This aim was achieved by measuring the (re-)activity of the autonomic nervous system (via heart variability indexes) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (via salivary cortisol levels), as well as through psychometric and behavioral assessments.

Fourty women, 25-50 years old, were instructed for a correct mode of self administration of the cream. On day 0, women came to the lab and were instrumented for electrocardiographic signal (ECG) recordings. Initially, a 10-min ECG was collected in resting conditions (baseline). Then, two 20-min ECGs were recorded, each following the self-administration (3-min duration) of the DAVC and a placebo cream (PLAC), in a randomized order. At the end of the baseline and the two post-cream administration recordings, saliva samples were collected. From day 1 to 28, subjects self-administered (at home, twice a day, at wake-up and bed time) either DAVC (n=20) or PLAC (n=20).

On day 29, they returned to the lab and ECGs and underwent a stress test (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). The test lasted 10 min and consisted in a stress interview (5 min), immediately followed by an arithmetic task. ECGs were collected in baseline (10 min), test (10 min), and recovery (20 min) phases. Saliva samples were collected at the end of the baseline and the middle and the end of the recovery phase. The subjects filled a number of psychological questionnaires, including Profile of Mood States (POMS, on day 0 and 29) and STAI-Y1 (on day 29). In addition, subjects were videorecorded during the TSST, in order to quantify their non verbal behavior patterns (via ECSI).

A single, self-administration of DAVC (day 0) produced a significant, acute potentiation of parasympathetic neural modulation (HF index: 25% increase as to baseline), whereas PLAC produced only a modest change (3% increase). DAVC provoked a modest (10%), non significant reduction of cortisol levels, which was similar to that induced by PLAC.

Prolonged DAVC self-administration (4 weeks) produced: (i) a significant inhibition of stress-induced cortisol elevation on day 29 (55% increase as compared to pre-stress value in DAVC group, 75% in PLAC group); (ii) a significant improvement of mood profile (POMS test) on day 29 compared to day 0; (iii) a reduction of perceived anxiety (STAI-Y1 score) at the end of the TSST; (iv) significantly lower scores of behavioral patterns linked to anxiety, motivational conflict and avoidance and higher scores of affiliation during the TSST, as compared to PLAC group.

These autonomic neural, neuroendocrine and psychological data suggest that a cream enriched with essential oils has both acute and long-term stress-reduction effects on human psychophysiology. Acute effects involve a potentiation of the parasympathetic component of autonomic neural regulation, which is usually associated with well-being, relaxation and resilience. The long-term effects point to a generalized stress-relief property, involving both the hormonal and psychological sides of stress adaptation.","Inclusion Criteria:

The goal of this study was to quantify the acute and persistent effects of a cosmetic routine based on the self-administration of a cream (DAVC) enriched with essential oils, namely Juniperus Phoenicea gum extract, Copaifera Officinalis resin, Aniba Rosodora wood oil, Juniperus Virginiana. This aim was achieved by measuring the (re-)activity of the autonomic nervous system (via heart variability indexes) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (via salivary cortisol levels), as well as through psychometric and behavioral assessments. Fourty women, 25-50 years old, were instructed for a correct mode of self administration of the cream. On day 0, women came to the lab and were instrumented for electrocardiographic signal (ECG) recordings. Initially, a 10-min ECG was collected in resting conditions (baseline). Then, two 20-min ECGs were recorded, each following the self-administration (3-min duration) of the DAVC and a placebo cream (PLAC), in a randomized order. At the end of the baseline and the two post-cream administration recordings, saliva samples were collected. From day 1 to 28, subjects self-administered (at home, twice a day, at wake-up and bed time) either DAVC (n=20) or PLAC (n=20). On day 29, they returned to the lab and ECGs and underwent a stress test (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). The test lasted 10 min and consisted in a stress interview (5 min), immediately followed by an arithmetic task. ECGs were collected in baseline (10 min), test (10 min), and recovery (20 min) phases. Saliva samples were collected at the end of the baseline and the middle and the end of the recovery phase. The subjects filled a number of psychological questionnaires, including Profile of Mood States (POMS, on day 0 and 29) and STAI-Y1 (on day 29). In addition, subjects were videorecorded during the TSST, in order to quantify their non verbal behavior patterns (via ECSI). A single, self-administration of DAVC (day 0) produced a significant, acute potentiation of parasympathetic neural modulation (HF index: 25% increase as to baseline), whereas PLAC produced only a modest change (3% increase). DAVC provoked a modest (10%), non significant reduction of cortisol levels, which was similar to that induced by PLAC. Prolonged DAVC self-administration (4 weeks) produced: (i) a significant inhibition of stress-induced cortisol elevation on day 29 (55% increase as compared to pre-stress value in DAVC group, 75% in PLAC group); (ii) a significant improvement of mood profile (POMS test) on day 29 compared to day 0; (iii) a reduction of perceived anxiety (STAI-Y1 score) at the end of the TSST; (iv) significantly lower scores of behavioral patterns linked to anxiety, motivational conflict and avoidance and higher scores of affiliation during the TSST, as compared to PLAC group. These autonomic neural, neuroendocrine and psychological data suggest that a cream enriched with essential oils has both acute and long-term stress-reduction effects on human psychophysiology. Acute effects involve a potentiation of the parasympathetic component of autonomic neural regulation, which is usually associated with well-being, relaxation and resilience. The long-term effects point to a generalized stress-relief property, involving both the hormonal and psychological sides of stress adaptation.

Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,OTHER,NCT00212979,Measuring Kidney Function in Kidney Transplantation,The Accurate Prediction of Renal Function in Kidney Transplant Recipients,"Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for permanent kidney failure. Following transplantation, the kidney function must be followed closely to detect problems so that investigations and appropriate treatment can be started early. Currently, function is monitored with the use of serum creatinine. In clinical trials involving kidney transplant recipients, markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine, are increasingly being used as outcomes to evaluate new treatments. However, serum creatinine is not very accurate or sensitive at detecting change in kidney transplant function. Newer methods of evaluating kidney function, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation and cystatin C, are known to be accurate markers of function in patients with non-transplant kidney disease. This study will compare the MDRD estimate and cystatin C estimate of kidney function with an accepted method (radioisotope clearance study) of measuring true kidney function in 250 renal transplant patients. Each patient will have 2 measurements made at least 3 months apart to determine the accuracy and responsiveness to change over time for the MDRD equation and cystatin C. If the results demonstrate that these new methods are accurate then clinical care and research studies involving transplant patients will be greatly enhanced. Patients and physicians would have a simple test that could detect problems earlier and more precisely monitor response to treatment leading to improved outcomes for renal transplant recipients.","Background and Hypothesis:

Short-term outcomes in renal transplantation, such as the acute rejection rate, have improved dramatically over the past decade. Unfortunately, this success has made it more difficult to evaluate new therapies in kidney transplantation. Markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine and creatinine clearance, are now being used to evaluate kidney transplant function. However, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance have many limitations and correlate poorly with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula has been shown to be very accurate at predicting GFR in patients with kidney disease who don't have renal transplants. Cystatin C, a novel marker of renal function, has also been shown to be accurate in transplant and non-transplant patients. However, the MDRD formula and cystatin C have not been properly validated in a large sample of renal transplant recipients.

Objectives:

The primary objective of this study is to determine if the MDRD formula accurately predicts GFR in renal transplant recipients. Secondary objectives of the study will determine whether: the MDRD formula is responsive to change in GFR over time, cystatin C accurately predicts GFR, or the MDRD formula is more accurate than other estimating equations in renal transplant recipients.

Research Plan:

A prospective cohort design will be used. Eligible adult renal transplant recipients at least 3 months post-transplantation will have serum creatinine, albumin, urea, cystatin C, 24-hour urine excretion of urea, 24-hour urine excretion of creatinine, 24-hour urine excretion of protein and GFR measured at study entry and at least 3 months later. GFR will be measured using 99Tc-DTPA. Estimates of the GFR will be made with the MDRD equation and other estimating equations. Renal function will also be assessed by measuring the urinary creatinine clearance and the combined urea and creatinine clearance. The primary analysis will determine the accuracy (proportion of GFR estimates that lie within 30% of measured GFR) of the MDRD equation. Secondary analyses will be performed to determine the bias (mean difference between the measured GFR and estimated GFR) and precision (standard deviation of the difference between the measured and estimated GFR) of the MDRD equation as well as the bias and precision of the change in GFR over twelve months. Similar analyses will be performed for cystatin C and other estimating equations.

Importance of Study:

New methods to accurately measure GFR are needed for both clinical care and research studies involving renal transplant recipients. As new therapies and immunosuppressive strategies become available, a simple and accurate means (such as the MDRD equation) to assess response to therapy will be invaluable. Markers of kidney function (serum creatinine, predicted GFR) are already being used in clinical trials involving renal transplant recipients without appropriate evaluation. The proper validation of equations to predict GFR in transplant recipients must be carried before they can be widely accepted in practice or for use in research protocols. If this study shows that the MDRD equation (or other marker of kidney function) is accurate in transplant patients then we can confidently move forward and use these validated measures of GFR in patient care and future research studies.","Inclusion Criteria:

Hong Kong Baptist University,OTHER,NCT05266079,Comparison Study for Perimenopausal Syndrome With Chinese Herbal Medicine,Comparison Study of the Effectiveness Between Syndrome Differentiation Treatments and Fixed Formula Treatment for Perimenopausal Syndrome With Chinese Herbal Medicine,"Background: Perimenopausal syndrome (PMS) refers to a series of symptoms caused by the dynamic fluctuations of sex hormones during menopause. Menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, vaginal dryness and mood swings are experienced by about 80% of Chinese women aged 45 to 60. In the past year, 235 patients visited CMCTR(ND), a TCM center set up by HA and operated by HKFTU Workers' Medical Clinics since 2008, suffered from PMS.

According to literature review, high proportion of clinical trials regarding perimenopausal women used fixed formula treatment. However, different constitutional types were found in perimenopausal women and different fixed formulae were used in different research. Apart from kidney yin deficiency, perimenopausal women were also found in liver-kidney yin deficiency, kidney yang deficiency, kidney yin and yang deficiency, disharmony between heart and kidney, liver qi stagnation, etc. It is difficult to draw a conclusion that any single fixed formula could have the best efficacy on PMS. Therefore, it is worth studying to see whether syndrome differentiation would be a better choice for PMS treatment.

Objective: The study aims to evaluate whether syndrome differentiated treatment is better than fixed formula (Er-Xian decoction) treatment for perimenopausal women.

Design: This is a pilot single-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Participants: Chinese women aged 45-55 year with menstruation abnormalities (menstrual irregularity in past 12 months; or menstrual period off at least twice in past 12 months; or amenorrhea of 2 to 12 months); also suffering any following perimenopausal symptoms: vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, sweats), psychological symptoms (insomnia, migraine, irritability), or genitourinary symptoms (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia)

Interventions: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of syndrome differentiated treatment versus a fixed formula (Er-Xian decoction) in treating PMS. 100 participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Intervention group of participants will be given medication by syndrome differentiating from qualified TCM Practitioners while the control group of participants will be given a fixed formula.

Outcome measures: Primary assessments outcome measure is the Kupperman Index, and the secondary outcome measure is MENQOL questionnaire.","Perimenopausal syndrome is also known as menopausal syndrome. Menopause Syndrome refers to women due to ovarian dysfunction or loss of estrogen causing a variety of systemic dysfunctions in the body, including the autonomic nervous system, dysfunction and metabolic disorders-based symptoms such as hot flushes and sweating, sleep disorders, depression, multiple joint pains, headache, dizziness, fatigue, etc. These symptoms seriously affect menopausal women . Modern medical treatment of perimenopausal syndrome mainly focus on Hormonal Therapy (HT). Studies have shown that the clinical effect of hormonal therapy would quickly relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal syndrome, including urogenital atrophy and prevention of osteoporosis .

However there were some scholars believed that although short-term use of hormone supplement therapy could relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal women, the role of estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women still needed to be further explored . The reason was that hormonal replacement therapy can cause more adverse reactions and potential risks such as increased cardiovascular disease, cerebral infarction, breast-related diseases, risk of embolism in veins and lungs and other diseases .

In the previous study, the investigators found that the Chinese herbal formula Er-Xian decoction was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency and severity of hot flushes and in relieving menopausal symptoms in Hong Kong perimenopausal women. It was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events noted during the study period. The study proved the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. The investigators designed this experiment in order to further understand the effectiveness between syndrome differentiation treatment and fixed prescription.

Syndrome differentiation and treatment is the process of recognizing and resolving diseases, the embodiment of the combination of theory and practice, the specific clinical application of principles and methods, and the basic principles guiding the clinical work of traditional Chinese medicine. Dialectics is the process of authentication. Syndrome is a summary of the pathological reflections of the body through four diagnostic methods (inspection, listening and smelling, inquiries, and palpation ). It would help to establish disease stages, including the location of disease, cause, nature, and relationship between healthy qi and pathogenic qi. Therefore, the syndrome would reveal the essence of the disease, and therefore enhance the disease management. Corresponding treatment method is determined based on the result of syndrome differentiation. Syndrome differentiation and treatment are two inseparable parts in the process of diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

There is no record of the term of the perimenopausal syndrome in the ancient Chinese medicine books. The investigators can find some similar symptoms recorded in ""Lily Disease"" , ""Hysteria"", and ""Insomnia""or ""Depression"" and other diseases in ancient books. Modern Chinese medicine gynecology calls it ""Premenopausal"". Traditional Chinese medicine believes that in perimenopausal women, the kidney qi is gradually declining. Dysfunction of qi and blood is mainly caused by kidney deficiency. Among them, the syndrome of kidney yin deficiency is the most common. According to the literature, the syndrome types are divided as follows:

1. Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency Syndrome: Before and after menstruation, the essence and blood are weak, or the body is in yin deficiency, yin does not guard the yang, yang is disturbed. Clinical symptoms include sweating, hot flushes, insomnia, forgetfulness, backache and weak legs, dry genitals, menstrual disorders, red tongue with less coating, pulse is rapid and thready. Suggested Formula: Gan Mai Bai He Di Hung Tang
2. Non Interaction Between Heart and Kidney:The woman's yin and yang are imbalanced, the yin essence is deficient, and the kidney yin deficiency and water does not nourish the wood, causing the liver fire to become prosperous. Common clinical symptoms include hot flush, sweating, palpitation, irritability, bitter mouth, dry mouth, red tongue with thin yellow coating, pulse is thready and rapid.

Menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, vaginal dryness and mood swings are experienced by about 80% of Chinese women aged 45 to 60. In the past year, 235 patients visited CMCTR(ND), a TCM center set up by HA and operated by HKFTU Workers' Medical Clinics since 2008, suffered from PMS. According to literature review, high proportion of clinical trials regarding perimenopausal women used fixed formula treatment. However, different constitutional types were found in perimenopausal women and different fixed formulae were used in different research. Apart from kidney yin deficiency, perimenopausal women were also found in liver-kidney yin deficiency, kidney yang deficiency, kidney yin and yang deficiency, disharmony between heart and kidney, liver qi stagnation, etc. It is difficult to draw a conclusion that any single fixed formula could have the best efficacy on PMS. Therefore, it is worth studying to see whether syndrome differentiation would be a better choice for PMS treatment. Objective: The study aims to evaluate whether syndrome differentiated treatment is better than fixed formula (Er-Xian decoction) treatment for perimenopausal women. Design: This is a pilot single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Participants: Chinese women aged 45-55 year with menstruation abnormalities (menstrual irregularity in past 12 months; or menstrual period off at least twice in past 12 months; or amenorrhea of 2 to 12 months); also suffering any following perimenopausal symptoms: vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, sweats), psychological symptoms (insomnia, migraine, irritability), or genitourinary symptoms (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia) Interventions: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of syndrome differentiated treatment versus a fixed formula (Er-Xian decoction) in treating PMS. 100 participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Intervention group of participants will be given medication by syndrome differentiating from qualified TCM Practitioners while the control group of participants will be given a fixed formula. Outcome measures: Primary assessments outcome measure is the Kupperman Index, and the secondary outcome measure is MENQOL questionnaire. Perimenopausal syndrome is also known as menopausal syndrome. Menopause Syndrome refers to women due to ovarian dysfunction or loss of estrogen causing a variety of systemic dysfunctions in the body, including the autonomic nervous system, dysfunction and metabolic disorders-based symptoms such as hot flushes and sweating, sleep disorders, depression, multiple joint pains, headache, dizziness, fatigue, etc. These symptoms seriously affect menopausal women . Modern medical treatment of perimenopausal syndrome mainly focus on Hormonal Therapy (HT). Studies have shown that the clinical effect of hormonal therapy would quickly relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal syndrome, including urogenital atrophy and prevention of osteoporosis . However there were some scholars believed that although short-term use of hormone supplement therapy could relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal women, the role of estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women still needed to be further explored . The reason was that hormonal replacement therapy can cause more adverse reactions and potential risks such as increased cardiovascular disease, cerebral infarction, breast-related diseases, risk of embolism in veins and lungs and other diseases . In the previous study, the investigators found that the Chinese herbal formula Er-Xian decoction was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency and severity of hot flushes and in relieving menopausal symptoms in Hong Kong perimenopausal women. It was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events noted during the study period. The study proved the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. The investigators designed this experiment in order to further understand the effectiveness between syndrome differentiation treatment and fixed prescription. Syndrome differentiation and treatment is the process of recognizing and resolving diseases, the embodiment of the combination of theory and practice, the specific clinical application of principles and methods, and the basic principles guiding the clinical work of traditional Chinese medicine. Dialectics is the process of authentication. Syndrome is a summary of the pathological reflections of the body through four diagnostic methods (inspection, listening and smelling, inquiries, and palpation ). It would help to establish disease stages, including the location of disease, cause, nature, and relationship between healthy qi and pathogenic qi. Therefore, the syndrome would reveal the essence of the disease, and therefore enhance the disease management. Corresponding treatment method is determined based on the result of syndrome differentiation. Syndrome differentiation and treatment are two inseparable parts in the process of diagnosis and treatment of diseases. There is no record of the term of the perimenopausal syndrome in the ancient Chinese medicine books. The investigators can find some similar symptoms recorded in ""Lily Disease"" , ""Hysteria"", and ""Insomnia""or ""Depression"" and other diseases in ancient books. Modern Chinese medicine gynecology calls it ""Premenopausal"". Traditional Chinese medicine believes that in perimenopausal women, the kidney qi is gradually declining. Dysfunction of qi and blood is mainly caused by kidney deficiency. Among them, the syndrome of kidney yin deficiency is the most common. According to the literature, the syndrome types are divided as follows: 1. Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency Syndrome: Before and after menstruation, the essence and blood are weak, or the body is in yin deficiency, yin does not guard the yang, yang is disturbed. Clinical symptoms include sweating, hot flushes, insomnia, forgetfulness, backache and weak legs, dry genitals, menstrual disorders, red tongue with less coating, pulse is rapid and thready. Suggested Formula: Gan Mai Bai He Di Hung Tang 2. Non Interaction Between Heart and Kidney:The woman's yin and yang are imbalanced, the yin essence is deficient, and the kidney yin deficiency and water does not nourish the wood, causing the liver fire to become prosperous. Common clinical symptoms include hot flush, sweating, palpitation, irritability, bitter mouth, dry mouth, red tongue with thin yellow coating, pulse is thready and rapid.

University of Alabama at Birmingham,OTHER,NCT03070184,"Race, Natriuretic Peptides and Physiological Perturbations",Racial Differences in the Natriuretic Peptide Response to Exercise and Beta-blockers,The purpose of the study is to understand the origins of differential response to beta-blockers in African-Americans and may provide insight regarding racial differences in cardiovascular risk.,"The heart is an endocrine organ. The natriuretic peptides are hormones produced in the heart and are secreted in response to increased wall stress in atria and ventricles. The principal circulating NPs are Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). The endocrine actions of NPs are natriuresis and dilatation of peripheral arteries.

The NPs concentrations are elevated in heart failure (HF) and hypertension (HTN) due to volume and pressure overload. Therefore, NPs are used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in heart failure. However, NPs role in healthy individuals is not known.

Previous studies have shown that reduced NP levels are associated with a greater risk of HTN. Moreover, African-Americans have lower resting NP levels than Caucasians. We hypothesize that relative NP deficiency in African American compared to Caucasian has the potential to contribute to increase risk of all-cause mortality, HTN, HF and its sequelae.

Evidence from multiple clinical trials has positioned beta-blockers as a standard heart failure therapy. Beta-blocker therapy leads to increased NP levels and suppression of Renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS) system. Suppression of renin levels by beta-blockers has been shown as a potential mechanism of benefit in HF.

The heart is an endocrine organ. The natriuretic peptides are hormones produced in the heart and are secreted in response to increased wall stress in atria and ventricles. The principal circulating NPs are Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). The endocrine actions of NPs are natriuresis and dilatation of peripheral arteries. The NPs concentrations are elevated in heart failure (HF) and hypertension (HTN) due to volume and pressure overload. Therefore, NPs are used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in heart failure. However, NPs role in healthy individuals is not known. Previous studies have shown that reduced NP levels are associated with a greater risk of HTN. Moreover, African-Americans have lower resting NP levels than Caucasians. We hypothesize that relative NP deficiency in African American compared to Caucasian has the potential to contribute to increase risk of all-cause mortality, HTN, HF and its sequelae. Evidence from multiple clinical trials has positioned beta-blockers as a standard heart failure therapy. Beta-blocker therapy leads to increased NP levels and suppression of Renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS) system. Suppression of renin levels by beta-blockers has been shown as a potential mechanism of benefit in HF. However, study shows that beta-blockers are less effective in African-Americans compared to Caucasians in HF treatment. So, the investigators have proposed a pilot study to look for race-based differences in the NP and RAAS response to metoprolol in healthy individuals.

* to test whether treatment-effects by induced hypertension, balloon-dilatation, or intra-arterial nimodipine infusion can be detected and quantified by UPI","The aim of the study is to assess brain tissue perfusion by ultrasound perfusion imaging (UPI).

The specific aim is to diagnose brain tissue hypoperfusion leading to infarction due to CVS with ultrasound perfusion imaging (UPI) and to correlate it with the gold standard of diagnosis of brain infarcts, i.e. with MRI and CT. According to contrast enhanced UPI brain tissue will be classified as (1) normal, i.e. not leading to tissue infarction, (2) as hypoperfused, i.e. functionally impaired and prone to DIND and to infarction, or (3) non-perfused. Thus, temporary hypoperfusion that may be resolved by therapy or spontaneously, not leading to tissue infarction shall be assessed. This strategy will lead to guiding therapy by UPI.

Questionnaire:

* to assess cerebral perfusion in patients with SAH by contrast enhanced UPI
* to assess specificity and sensitivity, as well as positive and negative predictive values of contrast enhanced UPI for detection of brain tissue misery perfusion leading to infarction
* to evaluate feasibility and practicability of repeated bed-side assessments of UPI
* to test whether treatment-effects like induced hypertension, balloon-dilation, or intra-arterial nimodipine infusion can be detected and quantified by contrast enhanced UPI
* to analyze whether TCD or contrast enhanced UPI is superior for screening of CVS and detection of cerebral infarcts (vessel vs. tissue assessment)
* to correlate contrast enhanced UPI with perfusion measurements by CT-perfusion imaging

Ultrasound perfusion imaging (UPI) is able to detect cerebral hypoperfusion that can result in cerebral infarction in a clinical setting. As reference the incidence of cerebral infarcts is assessed by CT- and MR-imaging and cerebral perfusion is analyzed by CT-perfusion (CTP) imaging.

The day of the ictus (SAH) is defined as day 0. The ultrasound examinations will be performed at

* Day 0-4: one baseline UPI study will be performed. This time period (0-4) is set as baseline, because this baseline investigation will be performed before vasospasm develops. The current policy of early aneurysm treatment results in clipping or coiling of patients within 24-48 hours. The relevant phase of CVS, however, starts on day 4 to 5 after the ictus. The already established routine protocol with early CT and CTP imaging after aneurysm treatment allows differentiation between infarcts due to the procedure of aneurysm clipping or coiling, bleeding, edema, or surgical contusions from cerebral infarcts due to CVS that develop later on. This early routine CT imaging includes a CT-perfusion study on post-op day 1, serving as reference for the ultrasound perfusion measurements.
* Day 5-14: during the term with the highest risk for CVS, a UPI study will be performed every second day.
* Several events trigger additional UPI studies:

  * angiography (scheduled or emergency)
  * endovascular intervention (angioplasty or intraarterial nimodipine infusion)
  * CT or MRI study with new infarcts
  * Development of DIND or reversal of DIND
  * in case of placement of an intracerebral microprobe (rCBF or ptiO2) an UPI study will be performed when significant changes (rCBF drop below 20ml/100g/min or below 60% of baseline, ptiO2 drop below 10mmHg or below 60% of baseline) occur.

Currently all patients are scanned by MRI and or CT several times in the course of the disease. Each imaging study serves as reference for UPI.

During day 5-14 high risk patients (Fisher grade 3, or TCD \> 150 cm/sec, or new deficit) receive one CT-perfusion study between day 7 and 11 (period of highest risk).

During day 5-14 patients with proven CVS (angiography) will receive two CT-perfusion studies, one at day 7, and one at day 11, or at the time when new deficits or infarcts evolve. Additional about 20% of patients will get MRI including perfusion weighted imaging (PWI). In these patients misery perfusion as detected by PWI serves as reference for UPI.

Some of these patients continue to have considerable respiratory symptoms or persistent hypoxemia. The CT abnormalities in these patients are often a combination of ground-glass opacities and patchy multifocal consolidation consistent with a pattern of OP. In several patients, these radiologic abnormalities persist even after the symptoms of active COVID-19 have subsided and swabs from the upper respiratory tract for SARS-CoV-2 have turned negative. Such patients may be classified as having a secondary form of OP, namely post-infectious OP. Some of the patients also start developing signs of fibrosis.

As with other forms of OP, patients with post-COVID OP or post COVID diffuse lung disease (PC-DLD) may benefit from treatment with oral glucocorticoids.

Glucocorticoids may be a double-edged sword in this clinical situation. Steroids reduce inflammation associated with OP with a resultant resolution of symptoms, improvement in gas exchange (resulting in the resolution of hypoxemia), and potentially preventing the progression of early parenchymal abnormalities to irreversible fibrosis. However, they are associated with adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, delayed viral clearance, and increased susceptibility to infections. The ideal dose of glucocorticoids for treating PC-DLD is unknown. As PC-DLD is likely to get recognised early (much earlier than the average duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis in other forms of OP, i.e., about 3-6 months), there is a possibility a lower intensity of glucocorticoids may be sufficient for treatment than the usual regimens, with the advantage of lesser adverse effects. A previous retrospective study that compared two regimens (higher dose intensity \[DI\] of glucocorticoids alone vs. glucocorticoids at a lower dose intensity along with clarithromycin), however, found that a complete radiologic response was higher in the prednisone alone (higher DI) group (81% vs. 63%) than in the combination group (with a lower DI of prednisone). Statistical significance was however not achieved (p=0.38), mainly due to the small sample size.

The investiagtors hypothesize that in PC-DLD a higher intensity (i.e., starting with a medium dose of prednisolone) will be more effective than a lower dose intensity (i.e., starting with a low dose of prednisolone) of glucocorticoids in effecting a radiologic response at six weeks.","Inclusion Criteria:

The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and anti-cancer activity of various doses and repeated cycles of the experimental treatment using the study drug RM-1929 and fixed amounts of red light applied at the tumor site to activate the pharmacodynamics of the drug.

The part 1 of the study has been completed and consisted in a single cycle, 3+3 dose escalation safety study of the experimental drug RM-1929 using a fixed amount of 690 nm red light. The part 1 was designed to determine the safety of the treatment as set by the maximal feasible dose or the maximal tolerable dose of RM-1929. From the part 1 results, the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929 was determined.

The part 2 of the study is currently ongoing and it is evaluating the safety and anticancer efficacy of up to four repeated treatments of Photoimmunotherapy with RM-1929 at the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929 activated with a fixed amount of red light.","Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is a new cancer targeted technology invented at the National Cancer Institute, USA. This clinical study evaluates the treatment of the experimental drug RM-1929 with Photoimmunotherapy (PIT).

The experimental drug, RM-1929, is a parental formulation consisting of a chemical conjugate of the dye IR700 with the FDA approved antibody, Erbitux® (Cetuximab), that targets EGFR receptors (EGFR is a cancer expressed protein, a cancer antigen). EGFR is highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC). It is expected that systemic administration of RM-1929 will lead to tumor accumulation and binding to EGFR expressed at cancer cells. It is expected that treatment with RM-1929 and Photoimmunotherapy can lead to the selective destruction of the HNSCC cancer cells and provide an effective therapy to manage the disease.

The treatment using RM-1929 with Photoimmunotherapy requires two steps:

(i) the administration by infusion of the drug RM-1929 targeting the cancer protein EGFR

AND

(ii) the illumination of the tumor with red light (690 nm) using sufficient energy to activate the drug and induce cancer cell killing.

Light illumination is applied at 24 h post drug infusion to enable sufficient time for the drug to distribute in the tumor after administration. Cell killing occurs only at cancer cells expressing the protein EGFR that is bound to the drug RM-1929. The requirement of binding of the drug to EGFR of cancer cells enables the selective destruction of cancer cells with minimum damage of healthy tissue surrounding the tumor cells. Preclinical pharmacology demonstrated that light-induced activation of RM-1929 elicits rapid tumor destruction of human cancer xenografts implanted in mice and that the treatment is cancer specific.

The Part 1 study has been completed and consisted of a single cycle 3+3 dose escalation study of RM-1929 to determine the safety of the treatment and the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929. From the part 1 of this study, the maximal feasible dose for treatment with RM-1929 was selected. The currently ongoing Part 2 of the clinical study is evaluating the safety and anti-cancer activity of up to 4 repeat treatment cycles of Photoimmunotherapy with RM-1929.","Inclusion Criteria:

National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS),NIH,NCT02257879,DHB Supplement Interaction Study,A Pharmacokinetic Study to Assess and Compare the Drug Interaction Risk of the Grapefruit Juice and Dietary Supplements Known to Inhibit CYP3A Enzyme Activity,"Background:

- Drinking grapefruit juice changes how long it takes some medicines to be broken down in the body. Researchers have found that a substance in grapefruit juice called DHB contributes to this effect. Some dietary supplements contain DHB and claim to increase the absorption of any and all supplements, medicine or any other drug. But these usually contain a lot more DHB than a glass of grapefruit juice. Researchers want to study the effects of grapefruit juice and supplements with DHB.

Objective:

- To compare how a certain dietary supplement (sold as DHB-300 ) versus grapefruit juice affects how long it takes a person s body to break down medicines.

Eligibility:

- Healthy volunteers ages 18 - 60.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.
* Participants will have 3 treatment visits. Participants cannot drive themselves home from the visits. Each visit lasts about 13.5 hours and includes:
* Questions about medications and participant s health.
* Vital signs taken.
* A finger probe to measure oxygen.
* Blood and urine sampling throughout the visit.
* An IV line inserted into an arm vein. It will stay there throughout the visit.
* Study treatments:
* Midazolam hydrochloride a syrup given to make people sleepy.
* Loperamide a tablet for treating diarrhea.
* 1 glass of water, 1 glass of grapefruit juice, or 1 pill of DHB-300. A different one will be given at each treatment visit.
* One week before each visit, participants cannot have certain fruits and juices. They must fast the night before each visit.
* For the 3 days after each visit, participants will return to the clinic 4 times. Their vital signs will be checked and blood will be drawn.","6 ,7 -dihydroxybergamottin (DHB) is one of the components of grapefruit juice and is a known irreversible inhibitor of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). A single serving (240 mL) of grapefruit juice (GFJ) contains less than or equal to 5 mg of DHB. The pharmacokinetic boosting effect of GFJ has fueled the marketing of dietary supplements labeled to contain DHB e.g. DHB 300 (TM) and Trisorbagen that enhance absorption naturally, While these supplements have been found to inhibit CYP3A activity, the DHB content in these supplements is much lower than that, of GFJ. Moreover, the effects of such supplements on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A-metabolized drugs are largely unknown. This single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-period, single-dose, crossover study in healthy volunteers will compare the drug interaction risk of a dietary supplement known to affect CYP3A with GFJ. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of a supplement known to affect CYP3A (e.g.Trisorbagen) with those of GFJ and water on the pharmacokinetics of two model substrates, the FDA-recommended CYP3A probe substrate midazolam, and the dual CYP3A/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate loperamide. This dual-probe substrate approach to assess drug interaction risk will provide mechanistic insight into any interaction observed. Eligible volunteers (n=12) will undergo 3 phases, each comprising an exposure visit and 4 subsequent post-exposure visits to collect blood and urine over 72 or 12 hours, respectively. Exposure visits will be scheduled at least 2 weeks apart to allow washout between the phases. At each exposure visit, participants will be administered oral doses of midazolam hydrochloride (2.5 mg) and loperamide (16 mg) concomitantly with water (240 mL), GFJ (240 mL), or Trisorbagen (with 240 mL water) according to a randomized treatment sequence. Blood and urine will be collected pre-dose and post-dose over 72 (blood) or 12 (urine) hours for subsequent analyses of relevant pharmacokinetic outcomes of each probe substrate, including the primary endpoints area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to infinity (AUC0-inf) and maximum observed concentration (Cmax). Secondary endpoints include geometric means, estimates of treatment differences, within-subject and between-subject treatment variance, as well as the 95% confidence intervals around those estimates.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Researchers have found that a substance in grapefruit juice called DHB contributes to this effect. Some dietary supplements contain DHB and claim to increase the absorption of any and all supplements, medicine or any other drug. But these usually contain a lot more DHB than a glass of grapefruit juice. Researchers want to study the effects of grapefruit juice and supplements with DHB. Objective: - To compare how a certain dietary supplement (sold as DHB-300 ) versus grapefruit juice affects how long it takes a person s body to break down medicines. Eligibility: - Healthy volunteers ages 18 - 60. Design: * Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. * Participants will have 3 treatment visits. Participants cannot drive themselves home from the visits. Each visit lasts about 13.5 hours and includes: * Questions about medications and participant s health. * Vital signs taken. * A finger probe to measure oxygen. * Blood and urine sampling throughout the visit. * An IV line inserted into an arm vein. It will stay there throughout the visit. * Study treatments: * Midazolam hydrochloride a syrup given to make people sleepy. * Loperamide a tablet for treating diarrhea. * 1 glass of water, 1 glass of grapefruit juice, or 1 pill of DHB-300. A different one will be given at each treatment visit. * One week before each visit, participants cannot have certain fruits and juices. They must fast the night before each visit. * For the 3 days after each visit, participants will return to the clinic 4 times. Their vital signs will be checked and blood will be drawn. 6 ,7 -dihydroxybergamottin (DHB) is one of the components of grapefruit juice and is a known irreversible inhibitor of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). A single serving (240 mL) of grapefruit juice (GFJ) contains less than or equal to 5 mg of DHB. The pharmacokinetic boosting effect of GFJ has fueled the marketing of dietary supplements labeled to contain DHB e.g. DHB 300 (TM) and Trisorbagen that enhance absorption naturally, While these supplements have been found to inhibit CYP3A activity, the DHB content in these supplements is much lower than that, of GFJ. Moreover, the effects of such supplements on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A-metabolized drugs are largely unknown. This single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-period, single-dose, crossover study in healthy volunteers will compare the drug interaction risk of a dietary supplement known to affect CYP3A with GFJ. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of a supplement known to affect CYP3A (e.g.Trisorbagen) with those of GFJ and water on the pharmacokinetics of two model substrates, the FDA-recommended CYP3A probe substrate midazolam, and the dual CYP3A/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate loperamide. This dual-probe substrate approach to assess drug interaction risk will provide mechanistic insight into any interaction observed. Eligible volunteers (n=12) will undergo 3 phases, each comprising an exposure visit and 4 subsequent post-exposure visits to collect blood and urine over 72 or 12 hours, respectively. Exposure visits will be scheduled at least 2 weeks apart to allow washout between the phases. At each exposure visit, participants will be administered oral doses of midazolam hydrochloride (2.5 mg) and loperamide (16 mg) concomitantly with water (240 mL), GFJ (240 mL), or Trisorbagen (with 240 mL water) according to a randomized treatment sequence. Blood and urine will be collected pre-dose and post-dose over 72 (blood) or 12 (urine) hours for subsequent analyses of relevant pharmacokinetic outcomes of each probe substrate, including the primary endpoints area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to infinity (AUC0-inf) and maximum observed concentration (Cmax). Secondary endpoints include geometric means, estimates of treatment differences, within-subject and between-subject treatment variance, as well as the 95% confidence intervals around those estimates. * INCLUSION CRITERIA: * Age 18-60 * Men and non-pregnant women * Participant in the Environmental Polymorphisms Registry. Prior to enrollment in this study the participant will be required to enroll in the -Environmental Polymorphisms Registry. * Willing to abstain from fruit juices, star fruit, grapefruit and grapefruit-related fruits (e.g., pomelo, Seville orange), and grapefruitcontaining products for 1 week prior to Exposure Visits and for the 4 follow-up visits. * Willing to fast (with the exception of water) from midnight prior to the screening visit and each Exposure Visit, including abstaining from alcohol and caffeinated beverages -Ability to successfully complete treatment visits, including securing transportation EXCLUSION CRITERIA: * Women who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding * Current use of known CYP3A inhibitors or inducers, which in the opinion of the Investigator poses an unacceptable risk to the patient or to the validity of study results.

Patients with PDR are typically considered candidates for pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) when non-clearing vitreous hemorrhaging, tractional retinal detachment (TRD) development with or without rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) or extensive fibrovascular proliferation occur. Visual prognosis is often guarded in patients with PDR undergoing PPV with higher grades of vitreoretinal (VR) adhesion because of the high rate of both intra-operative and postoperative complications. Releasing all significant traction caused by VR adhesion during PPV is critical for achieving long-term anatomic success and obtaining better visual outcomes in these patients with more advanced disease. Failure to relieve VR adhesion often leads to persistent, recurrent or de novo TRD with or without RRD in the perioperative and postoperative period, which then results in one or more reoperations and ultimately a poor visual prognosis. Maneuvers to remove VR adhesion during PPV are challenging and can result in posterior and/or peripheral retinal holes, which then may lead to postoperative proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and recurrent or de novo RRD. Silicone oil and long-acting gas tamponade have been employed during PPV with reported success in cases with complex RRD and PVR. And even though silicone oil and long-acting gas tamponade are currently in wide use for patients with PDR and high-grade VR adhesion undergoing PPV (especially when intra-operative breaks occur), little clinical data is available regarding which tamponading agent is best-suited for this patient population. Previous studies have been retrospective in nature and are tarnished by selection bias when tamponading agents are compared (i.e. cases with more severe grades of VR adhesion and intra-operative breaks typically are selected to receive silicone oil tamonade over gas). Presently, there are not any randomized controlled trials reported on this topic. In this randomized controlled trial, we compare silicone oil tamponade to 16% C3F8 gas tamponade in patients with PDR undergoing PPV for the management of TRD (with or without RRD) and/or extensive fibrovascular proliferation with or without vitreous hemorrhaging.","Inclusion Criteria:

1. Subject age is 18-85 years.
2. Subject consents to study participation and is capable of 6 months of follow-up.
3. The subject has type I or II Diabetes Mellitus with active PDR in the study eye.
4. Best-corrected spectacle visual acuity (BCSVA) on the Snellen eye chart ranges from 20/40 to hand motions in the study eye.
5. The subject is determined to need a PPV because of reduced BCSVA from 1) a TRD with or without RRD and/or vitreous hemorrhaging, or 2) extensive fibrous proliferation with or without vitreous hemorrhaging. When TRD is the reason for PPV, the TRD must be threatening (within one disc diameter) or involving the fovea. When fibrovascular proliferation is the reason for PPV, it must be extensive (\>3 clock hours) and threatening (within one disc diameter) or involving the fovea. The presence of subretinal fluid on B-scan ultrasonography, clinical exam, or OCT determines whether or not to classify the indication as TRD (subretinal fluid is present) or fibrous proliferation (no subretinal fluid present). Most subjects will have concurrent vitreous hemorrhaging, so it is critical that a B-scan ultrasound be performed to confirm a TRD or fibrous proliferation.

University of Pittsburgh,OTHER,NCT05724784,Development and Feasibility Testing of a Suicide Prevention Intervention for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth,Development and Feasibility Testing of a Suicide Prevention Intervention for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth,"This study aims to develop and test a brief, digital, suicide prevention intervention for sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth who have experienced cyberbullying. Leading up to this phase, the study team completed two prior study aims, focused on identifying perspectives of SGM youth's regarding their experiences with cyberbullying and priorities for an intervention, and a phase in which SGM youth codesigned the study's intervention with the study team. This resulted in the development of study's intervention, Flourish, which leverages a text messaging-based chatbot to reduce suicide risk following cyberbullying among SGM youth through improving distress tolerance, motivation for help-seeking, and social problem-solving.

Current Study Aim:

Conduct an open trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Flourish among cyberbullied SGM youth, ages 12-17 (N=10).

Hypotheses:

Feasibility will be evidenced by recruitment/retention rates \> 80% and use of Flourish among \> 70% of SGM youth.

At follow-up, adolescents will report improved problem-solving capacity, distress tolerance, and motivation for help-seeking and reduced psychological distress and suicidal ideation compared to baseline.","FLOURISH:

Flourish is a chatbot that will aim to improve adolescents' capacity to cope following cyberbullying and reduce their suicidal risk. The duration of Flourish is 4 weeks. Flourish is designed to be self-paced with branching logic, aiming to provide the right type of support at the right time youth need it. Therefore, the frequency with which youth interact with Flourish will differ from person to person. However, participants are expected to interact with Flourish no less than 2-3 times per week.

Onboarding. Prior to initiating Flourish, adolescents and their caregivers will participate in a session of approximately 30 minutes with a study clinician in which they will onboard to Flourish. During onboarding, the clinician will orient the adolescent to Flourish and load information onto Flourish that will be available to the adolescent throughout their use of the intervention. This will include personal crisis contacts, such as trusted adults and crisis hotlines they could contact in the event of a crisis, as well as contacts for people they could reach out to for support or distraction outside of a crisis situation, such as a close friend or a family member. Adolescents will additionally enter information to personalize their experience with Flourish, such as entering preferences for coping skills that work best for them. During the onboarding process, caregivers will be provided with resources to respond to cyberbullying s as well as information on their child's personal crisis resources.

Launch. The research team will administer brief questionnaires to adolescents 2-3 times per week during the 4-week intervention period that assess positive/supportive and negative/bullying interactions on social media. If adolescents indicate negative interactions, Flourish will automatically launch. If adolescents indicate supportive interactions (or no interactions), they will be given the option to launch Flourish to practice their coping skills, so they are prepared to respond to future cyberbullying events.

Resource Website:

Participants receiving Flourish will also have access to an accompanying website. The website will not collect or store any private information from the participant, and the participant will not interact with the website. It is a publicly available website that provides a list of resources participants may use, if needed. For example, this will include SGM mental health organizations and organizations that provide education, support, and advocacy for youth who have experienced cyberbullying.

Treatment Targets:

To reduce psychological distress and suicidal ideation, Flourish will deploy distress tolerance skills and utilize principles of problem-solving therapy and motivational interviewing.

Problem-Solving. Problem-solving therapy (PST) is a brief cognitive-behavioral intervention that aims to improve coping with stressful life events. PST has shown efficacy in reducing suicide risk among youth and has been successfully delivered in a self-guided online format. Flourish will target: problem identification by aiding youth in appraising the threat of the cyberbullying event they experienced and their socioemotional consequences, generation of potential solutions based on available resources for response, and decision-making through considering barriers and facilitators to putting solutions into action.

Motivation. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a patient-centered approach that provides a framework for enhancing intrinsic motivation for change that has shown efficacy for improving help-seeking among youth at suicidal risk and has been used in digital mental health interventions. Flourish will incorporate the spirit of MI through its clinical style (i.e., collaborative, empowering language) and MI techniques through responses that are affirming, reflections to demonstrate the chatbot is listening, and offer simple summaries to evoke a change mindset. Flourish will engage strategies to support self-efficacy by focusing on confidence in help-seeking. Through a library of messages, refined to assure fidelity with MI principles, Flourish will elicit thoughts about seeking help following cyberbullying, assess readiness for behavior change through rulers that assess importance and confidence in change, and make a plan for help-seeking. Youth will be offered individualized feedback through stories of SGM adolescents' help-seeking experiences. Developed by writers in partnership with SGM youth, stories will target key motivational barriers to help-seeking following cyberbullying identified in the investigators' pilot data: trust, confidentiality, fear of negative appraisal, and disbelief that help will be effective. Stories will be tailored, i.e., offering examples for youth of differing ages, genders, and identities, and will consider experiences specific to SGM youth of color.

Distress Tolerance. Flourish will be designed to support adolescents' tolerance of distress in recognition that sustained distress experiences contribute to suicidal ideation and interfere with adaptive problem-solving. Flourish will lead youth in monitoring distress levels and respond with a coping skills library that leverages existing online content, focusing on distraction and self-soothing (e.g., guided meditation, breathing exercises, and savoring positive memories).","Inclusion Criteria:

Standard care means the participant will be treated according to the clinic's standard practice. The study sponsor will not be involved in how participants are treated with VPRIV, will provide instructions on how the clinic will record what happens during the study.

VPRIV is a type of enzyme replacement therapy (also known as ERT). Before starting the study, participants must either have switched from substrate reduction therapies (SRT) to VPRIV or switched from other enzyme replacement therapies to SRT then finally to VPRIV. During this time, medical data will be collected from the participants' medical records.

During the study, participants will be treated with VPRIV according to their clinic's standard practice. VPRIV is given by a slow injection into the vein, also known as an infusion. This will happen in the clinic or at home.

The study will record if blood levels of specific substances remain stable or improve during the switch to treatment with VPRIV. Some of these substances will show if organs such as the liver or spleen are working well. Others are blood cells that help blood to clot, known as platelets. Another is a substance in a red blood cell used to carry oxygen around the body, known as hemoglobin.

Participants will use a digital tool so they can be more involved in decision making in their treatment. The digital tool is a mobile phone app, in which each participant can log their daily activities, their general health and wellbeing, and other key information.

Medical data will also be collected from the participants' charts during this time.

Health problems of the participants will be recorded during the study to check if there were any side effects from VPRIV treatment.

"University of California, San Francisco",OTHER,NCT05158179,Assessment of Laryngopharyngeal Sensation in Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia,Assessment of Laryngopharyngeal Sensation in Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia,"Study investigators have completed a study testing laryngopharyngeal sensation at specific laryngopharyngeal subsites using a novel buckling force aesthesiometer in a series of 22 healthy adults at this institution. Investigators would like to use the same device apparatus to evaluate laryngopharyngeal sensation in patients with laryngopharyngeal disorders, such as adductor spasmodic dysphonia. This study will use a tested laryngopharyngeal aesthesiometer to examine laryngeal sensation using calibrated tactile stimuli to determine differences in somatotopic perceptual strength maps of laryngopharyngeal structures between patients with laryngopharyngeal disorders and healthy controls.","Participant Recruitment Subjects with adductor type LD (AdLD) were identified and recruited by advertisements and by study clinicians at their institution. Advertisements were physically placed in the UCSF Voice and Swallowing Center clinic and were delivered electronically through the website of the National Spasmodic Dysphonia Association and to area LD (""spasmodic dysphonia"") support groups.

Adults greater than 18 years old with AdLD were included if they received a diagnosis established by a multi-disciplinary evaluation by a fellowship-trained laryngologist and voice-specialized speech-language pathologist. Subjects diagnosed by a physician outside of the study facility were evaluated in-person by a fellowship-trained laryngologist to confirm their eligibility for this study. All patients were required to have history of favorable response to intra-laryngeal botulinum toxin A (BtxA) treatment, as further demonstration of the correct diagnosis of ADLD. This was especially helpful for patients initially diagnosed outside of our center. Subjects with abductor or mixed type LD were not included in the present study due to their low incidence, but concurrent essential tremor (ET) of the vocal tract was accepted.

Patients were also excluded if they had a history of: concurrent laryngeal diseases or conditions other than AdLD+/-ET; bleeding disorder or current anticoagulation use; head and neck radiation; active tobacco use; or drinking more than two alcoholic beverages per day. If laryngopharyngeal lesions and/or masses, impeding abnormal laryngopharyngeal structure(s), or excessive post-nasal drip were noted on laryngoscopy, then examination ceased, and patients were excluded. Prior to testing, subjects also completed symptom-specific patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), including: Reflux Symptom Index (RSI),18 Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10),19 Dyspnea Index (DI),20 Cough Severity Index (CSI),21 and Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10).22 These PROMs are standardly collected as part of the routine clinical are for all patients undergoing evaluation at this center and are reported herein for holistic characterization of these subjects but not intended as a reflection or measure of the severity of their AdLD. Lastly, to avoid any potentially confounding physical effects from the injection (e.g., vocal fold edema), no testing was performed in the two weeks immediately following BtxA treatment. For patient convenience and to facilitate maximal enrollment, patients were allowed to undergo testing at any point outside of this post-injection window, although the majority pursued testing immediately prior to a BtxA injection on the same day.

Healthy controls were defined as adults between 18 and 85 years of age without laryngopharyngeal disease and were subject to the same screening and exclusion criteria.23 Additionally, controls were excluded if they had abnormal patient reported outcome measures (i.e. Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score\> 13, Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) score\>2, or Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) score\> 11).

Aesthesiometer Device As outlined in previous work, modified nylon monofilaments fixed to the end of 5-French open lumen catheters were utilized to deliver tactile stimuli to laryngopharyngeal subsites.12 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously ruled the aesthesiometer to be a Nonsignificant Risk (NSR) Device Study (Q190371/S001). Three nylon monofilament sizes (6-0, 5-0, 4-0) were cut to a calibrated length of 30 mm to deliver three distinct tactile stimuli of increasing strength, known as buckling-force. The 6-0, 5-0, and 4-0 monofilaments deliver an increasing mean force of 0.03 g, 0.11 g, and 0.30 g, respectively.12 An intermediary strength ""4.5-0"" monofilament was created by using a 5-0 monofilament of 25mm length, which has been demonstrated to have a mean buckling force of 0.19 g.23 During testing, the monofilaments were passed through the working channel of a flexible ENF-VT2 laryngoscope (Olympus America, Inc., Center Valley, PA) to allow for direct visualization and concurrent stimulation of laryngopharyngeal subsites.

Laryngopharyngeal Sensory Evaluation All subjects underwent a standard protocol for laryngopharyngeal sensory evaluation. This has been described in detail previously but briefly reviewed again here.12,13 Prior to testing, subjects were screened for any recent changes in conditions affecting voice and swallowing to ascertain subjects-maintained inclusion criteria. Three investigators executed laryngopharyngeal testing: 1) one to operate the laryngoscope; 2) one to maneuver the aesthesiometer monofilament; and 3) one to monitor testing, record subjective patient response, and observe cough/gag/swallow responses.

An investigator then examined both nasal passageways with a nasal speculum, selecting the more patent pathway for laryngoscope insertion. The more patent nasal passageway was topically anesthetized with cottonoid pledgets soaked in a 50/50 mixture of 4% lidocaine hydrochloride and neosynephrine. The cottonoid pledgets were compressed to remove excess liquid to avoid unintentional spillage posteriorly to the nasopharynx and potentially larynx, and left in place for five minutes.

The channeled laryngoscope was then inserted along the inferior meatus towards the posterior nasopharyngeal wall. The 6-0 monofilament was pressed against the posterior nasopharyngeal wall and swiftly removed to establish a perceptual strength of ""1"". If subjects were insensate to this stimulation, monofilament size was incrementally increased (i.e., 5-0, 4.5-0, and 4-0) until the stimulus was perceived, to establish this internal anchor. As per the validated, standardized protocol, all AdLD participants were stimulated on the left, allowing maximal visualization of the vocal folds during testing due to camera configuration of the flexible laryngoscope. Only four controls were stimulated on the right side, during earliest phases of testing.

Starting with the 6-0 monofilament, the lateral pyriform sinus (LPS) was presented with the planned stimulus, followed by the aryepiglottic fold (AEF) and the false vocal folds (FVF). (Figure 1) Participants were instructed to raise their hand when the stimulus was detected, and then were asked by the study team to report a perceptual strength ""score,"" in comparison to the nasopharyngeal anchor strength of 1. LAR response was observed and recorded by the study team. A negative response was defined as a lack of LAR to two appropriate stimuli. Gag or cough response to stimuli delivery were also recorded, assuming a positive LAR during these observations.

The LPS and AEF were tested in order of increasing stimulus: 5-0, 4.5-0 and 4-0 monofilaments. The false vocal folds (FVF) were tested last, in the same order of increasing monofilament strength. Testing of FVF terminated after the first observed LAR given site sensitivity, assuming positive responses would also be present for increased monofilament strength.

LAR Assessment Confirmation of LAR was determined using post-hoc frame-by-frame analysis of video recordings. Unilateral or bilateral vocal fold adduction following stimulus delivery was recorded as a positive response. Upon review, stimuli were excluded if they did not produce 10-30% monofilament buckling (as observed by the reviewer), were entrapped by saliva, or could not compress orthogonally to the mucosal surface. Additionally, if line of sight of visualization of vocal fold adduction was obstructed or confounded by phonation, the stimuli were excluded. All stimuli were reviewed by one study investigator with 30% of stimuli reviewed by a blinded second reviewer. Disagreements were reconciled by a blinded third reviewer.","Inclusion Criteria:

Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust,OTHER_GOV,NCT01761279,High Definition Endoscopy With i-Scan for Small Colonic Polyp Evaluation: The HiScope Study,A Prospective Single-blind Observational Cohort Study of High Definition White Light Endoscopy and i-Scan Image Enhancement for the Characterisation of Small Colonic Polyps,"Current standard practice is to remove all colonic polyps found during colonoscopy as it has not been possible to distinguish between polyps with some malignant potential (adenomatous) and those with negligable malignant potential (non-adenomatous).

Recent advances in endoscope imaging and technology have allowed endoscopists to distinguish between these two types of polyps by examining minute surface details.

i-Scan is a new digital enhancement method that aims to enhance surface details and may enable similar accurate distinction between adenomatous and non-adenomatous polyps.

Hypothesis:

High definition white light endoscopy plus i-Scan improves diagnostic accuracy of in-vivo assessment of colonic polyps \<10mm in size over high definition white light endoscopy alone.","Traditionally all polyps detected at colonoscopy, except obvious cancers, have been removed. It is felt that small (\<10mm diameter) hyperplastic polyps cannot be reliably distinguished from adenomatous polyps by endoscopists \[1\]. Therefore a large number of hyperplastic polyps are removed unnecessarily. This results in increased risk to patients through exposing them to unnecessary polypectomy, and increased cost to the health service through the cost of processing greater numbers of histopathology specimens. The cost per specimen is around £58.

This challenge of distinguishing small hyperplastic polyps from small adenomatous polyps has been met over the past decade through the use of novel chromoendoscopy and computed 'virtual chromoendoscopy' techniques.

Chromoendoscopy involves using staining or contrast dyes to highlight the minute surface patterns in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. The dyes are applied to the colonic mucosa via the working channels of the endoscope. Vital stains such as cresyl violet and methylene blue, which are taken up into epithelial cells, have been used by Japanese endoscopists for many years. Work by Kudo et al showed that by using these stains in combination with magnification endoscopy the minute 'pit patterns' of colonic mucosal lesions could be precisely examined and classified. The pits described are the surface opening of the mucosal crypts. Kudo showed that the surface pit pattern could predict the histology of a lesion with high accuracy \[2-4\], enabling distinction between adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. Concerns regarding potential harmful effects of vital stains increased the popularity of an alternative chromoendoscopy dye, indigocarmine \[5\]. Indigocarmine is not taken up by cells but lies on the colonic wall. Studies from East Asia, the USA and Europe published in the early part of the last decade showed that by combining indigocarmine and magnification endoscopy, neoplastic colonic polyps (adenomas) could be distinguished from non-neoplastic hyperplastic polyps with accuracy rates of 68-96% \[6-10\]. By the same method, surface patterns could also identify small early colorectal cancers\[11\] . Subsequent studies demonstrated that indigocarmine could adequately distinguish between adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps without the need for optical magnification \[12-15\].

During the past few years new methods of closely examining lesions within the colon have been developed. Digital imaging techniques or 'virtual chromoendoscopy' systems have been developed by endoscope manufacturers as a 'push-button' alternative to chromoendoscopy dyes, being potentially simpler and quicker to use. The first of these novel technologies available was the narrow band imaging (NBI) system produced by Olympus. A filter within the endoscope selects out narrow bandwidths of blue and green light, and thus reduces red light. These wavelengths penetrate only the superficial layers of the mucosa, highlighting surface patterns and microvasculature. Adenomatous polyps have more numerous and prominent microvessels in comparison to hyperplastic poylps. This system has been shown to be effective in differentiating small hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps with accuracies of 91 - 94% \[16-23\].

The Fujinon Intelligent Colour Enhancement (FICE) system developed by Fujinon uses post-processor electronic colour filter technology to allow a range of filter images with different wavelengths of light to be viewed. Similar results to NBI have been achieved in the characterisation of small polyps \[13, 24, 25\].

More recently a further virtual chromoendoscopy system, i-Scan has been developed by Pentax. i-Scan identifies areas of contrast between adjacent pixels (ie light bordering dark) and enhances this contrast. Additionally in a similar method to FICE, post-processor manipulation of the red, green and blue components of the spectrum is used to enhance vessels and surface structures.

A single study from Germany has suggested that i-Scan improves the detection of lesions during flexible sigmoidoscopy and can accurately predict histology. There is a need for further data on the clinical efficacy of i-Scan in the assessment of colonic polyps, particularly in a UK population and in a bowel cancer screening population, neither of which have been studied to date.

Through the use of these new technologies it may be possible to accurately predict the histology of small polyps in real time. Once an in-vivo diagnosis has been made with high confidence it may be possible for small hyperplastic polyps to be discarded, rather than sent for histological analysis, or to be left in situ \[22\]. This has potential benefits in reducing the frequency and consequent risk of polypectomy for patients and could also reduce pathology costs. UK and US guidelines for repeat surveillance colonoscopy after adenomas are detected at baseline examination are based on the number and size and histology of adenomas \[26, 27\]. At present these 'rescope intervals' are determined once the histology report of any resected polyps is received. With accurate in-vivo diagnosis these intervals may be set immediately after the baseline colonoscopy has been completed.

Whilst the development of these endoscopic advanced imaging technologies is to be welcomed, it is important for studies to determine what can be achieved through their use, over and above standard white-light colonoscopy. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has identified the utility of technologies used in the real-time assessment of diminutive (\<5mm) colonic polyps as a key area for study, and has published guidelines on the minimum standards which new endoscopic technologies should meet before their use becomes widely adopted \[28\].

We aim to evaluate HDWL and HDWL + i-Scan for the real time assessment and prediction of histology of small colonic polyps in a BCSP population.","Inclusion Criteria:

Through the use of these new technologies it may be possible to accurately predict the histology of small polyps in real time. Once an in-vivo diagnosis has been made with high confidence it may be possible for small hyperplastic polyps to be discarded, rather than sent for histological analysis, or to be left in situ \[22\]. This has potential benefits in reducing the frequency and consequent risk of polypectomy for patients and could also reduce pathology costs. UK and US guidelines for repeat surveillance colonoscopy after adenomas are detected at baseline examination are based on the number and size and histology of adenomas \[26, 27\]. At present these 'rescope intervals' are determined once the histology report of any resected polyps is received. With accurate in-vivo diagnosis these intervals may be set immediately after the baseline colonoscopy has been completed. Whilst the development of these endoscopic advanced imaging technologies is to be welcomed, it is important for studies to determine what can be achieved through their use, over and above standard white-light colonoscopy. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has identified the utility of technologies used in the real-time assessment of diminutive (\<5mm) colonic polyps as a key area for study, and has published guidelines on the minimum standards which new endoscopic technologies should meet before their use becomes widely adopted \[28\]. We aim to evaluate HDWL and HDWL + i-Scan for the real time assessment and prediction of histology of small colonic polyps in a BCSP population. Inclusion Criteria: * Patients found to have colonic polyps up to 10mm in size Exclusion Criteria: * Poor bowel preparation * Inflammatory bowel disease * Polyposis syndrome"

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and filgrastim together followed by paclitaxel before surgery may be an effective treatment for breast cancer","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the pathologic response rate in patients with operable breast cancer treated with a two part, neoadjuvant regimen consisting of weekly doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) and daily oral cyclophosphamide given with G-CSF (filgrastim) support for 12 weeks followed weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the clinical response rate in patients with surgically resectable breast cancer treated with weekly doxorubicin and daily oral cyclophosphamide given with G-CSF support for 12 weeks.

II. To assess the clinical response rate in patients with surgically resectable breast cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks.

III. To assess the relapse rate, overall and disease-free survival in patients with operable breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of weekly doxorubicin and daily oral cyclophosphamide given with G-CSF support for 12 weeks followed weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks and adjuvant chemotherapy with Xeloda (capecitabine), Methotrexate and Navelbine (vinorelbine tartrate) (XMN).

IV. To assess the toxicity associated with these regimens. V. To assess whether the phenotype of breast cancer changes with treatment. VI. To assess whether phenotypic changes in breast tumors predict outcome.

OUTLINE:

PART I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each week, cyclophosphamide orally (PO) once daily (QD), and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) QD on days 2-7 of each week. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PART II: Patients\* receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 of each week. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo definitive surgical resection by partial mastectomy (lumpectomy) or mastectomy after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

PART III: Patients\*\* unable to achieve complete pathologic response (pCR) or disease that has been down-staged to =\< 1 cm with no positive nodes following surgery receive capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, methotrexate IV on days 1, 8 and 15, and vinorelbine tartrate IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

NOTE: \*Patients with HER2/neu-positive disease also receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes once weekly or every 3 weeks for 1 year beginning in Part II.

NOTE: \*\*Patients with hormone receptor-positive disease also receive tamoxifen PO QD for 5 years (premenopausal) OR letozole PO QD or tamoxifen PO QD for 5 years (postmenopausal) beginning in Part III.

Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires,OTHER,NCT04673279,Long-term COVID-19 Immune Response in a Vulnerable Neighbourhood in Argentina,"Long-term Persistence of Immunoglobulin G Antibodies Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in a Vulnerable Neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina","Between June 10t h and July 1st, a cross-sectional design study in an Argentina slum, showed a prevalence based on immunoglobuling G-class (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) of 53.4%. It remains unanswered whether natural infection produces sustained antibodies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the presence of IgG antibodies for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after 5 months in inhabitants of Barrio 31 who consented the Seroprevalence Study for COVID-19.","Background Between June 10t h and July 1st, a cross-sectional design study was carried out in an Argentina slum over people, selected from a probabilistic sample of households showed a prevalence based on IgG-class antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 of 53.4%. In regarding to the persistence of these antibodies, the early data brought hope that acquired immunity was possible. But some subsequent studies have suggested that immune protection might be short-lived. The new findings show that people who survive a COVID-19 infection continue to produce protective antibodies against key parts of the virus for at least three to four months after developing their first symptoms. In contrast, some other antibody types decline more quickly.

It remains unanswered whether natural infection produces a sustained immunity that is capable of establishing herd immunity. The other health problem that Latin America faces is dengue, whose transmission, like SARS-CoV-2, is greater in areas with high population density such as vulnerable neighborhoods. In this context, the occurrence of the two diseases implies a risk, particularly in regions with several dengue serotypes where secondary and tertiary infections have been demonstrated and dengue epidemiological surveillance has been affected by the saturation of health system.

Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate the presence of IgG antibodies for COVID-19 after 5 months in inhabitants of this slum who consented the Seroprevalence Study for COVID-19, and to evaluate those factors associated with the persistence of positive antibodies. As a secondary objective, the presence of positive IgG for dengue will be evaluated.

Methods Cross sectional study. Population of the study were inhabitants of the slum: men and women form 14 years of age or older were included. People will be invited to participated and detection of antibodies will be performed with ta serological tests, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed and validated in Argentina which detects antibodies against two viral antigens, trimeric spike and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Blood sample will be collected in a capillary tube from a finger prick taken at the doorstep of each person. Samples will be processed and analyzed at the ""Hospital de Niños Doctor Ricardo Gutierrez"" Virology laboratory.

Blood sample collection and epidemiological data were collected, and entered in a secure database.

Sample Size The first seroprevalence study included 426 inhabitants of 14 years or more. Considering a persistence of antibodies of 30% with a precision of 5% for a confidence interval of 95% 184 inhabitants should be included. This sample will be selected by a proportionate stratified random sampling, considering the ten sectors in which the slum is divided.

Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics of the data will be carried out according to the variables obtained. Continuous variables will be expressed as mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables as proportions. A multiple logistic regression model will be performed to evaluate the factors associated with the persistence of positive antibodies for SARS-CoV-2.

National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),NIH,NCT02225184,Impact of Delta Opioid Receptor Gene (OPRD1) Variations on Treatment Outcome in African Americans,The Impact of Delta Opioid Receptor Gene (OPRD1) Variations on Treatment Outcome in African Americans,"Background:

- Differences in peoples genes can make them respond to drugs in different ways. Methadone and buprenorphine are two drugs used to treat drug addiction. A study showed that African Americans with a certain genetic marker did better using one kind of drug treatment over the other. Researchers want to see if they can repeat these findings. They also want to study other things that affect how well people do in treatment.

Objective:

- To see if certain genetic markers and other facts about a person s life can predict how well they do in treatment for addiction to opioids and cocaine.

Eligibility:

- African American adults age 18 and over. They must be former or current participants in an Archway Treatment Clinic study. They must have been on a stable dose of either study drug for at least 12 weeks. They also must have given urine samples regularly for at least 10 weeks.

Design:

* Participants will come to the clinic for 1 visit lasting about 2 hours.
* Participants will give 1 teaspoon of blood for genetic testing. They will be asked if their sample can be used in future studies.
* If researchers cannot get enough blood, they will do a cheek swab. This will collect skin cells for genetic testing.
* Participants will fill out 3 questionnaires.
* Results of genetic testing and answers to questionnaires will be kept private.","The NIDA Clinical Trials Network s (CTN) START Study was designed to look at the pharmacogenetics of treatment response. The CTN investigators found that an intronic SNP (rs678849) in the gene for the opioid delta-1 receptor (OPRD1) strongly predicted treatment response in African-Americans. Specifically, during treatment with methadone, African-Americans with one variant of the SNP (CC) were less likely to use illicit opioids compared to African-Americans with other variants of the SNP (CT or TT) (relative risk = 0.53, 95% CI 0.46-0.60, p = 0.001). During treatment with buprenorphine, the association was reversed: African-Americans with the CC variant were more likely to use illicit opioids, compared to those with the CT or TT variants (relative risk = 2.13, 95% CI 1.81-2.45, p = 0.012). This pattern of findings was unexpected, both in terms of racial specificity and differential drug associations. Replication in a new sample is crucial to determining whether it represents a real effect.

Study objectives include: (1) To independently replicate the pharmacogenetic NIDA CTN findings by comparing urine drug screen opioid results for rs678849 genotype groups among opioid-addicted African-American individuals, treated with either buprenorphine or methadone; (2) To determine whether any effect of rs678849 genotype varies by demographic, drug use, mental health, and psychosocial characteristics; (3) To determine whether any effect of rs678849 genotype extends to cocaine use, and (4) To examine haplotype blocks in OPRD1 that might help explain the association.

We will recruit a sample of n=135 (to obtain 130 completers; 65 methadone, 65 buprenorphine) current and former participants in Archway treatment studies in order to have power of 0.80 to detect a difference of 0.5 standard deviations between rs678849 genotypes. To be eligible, participants must have received a stable dose (no taper \> 7 days in length) of buprenorphine or methadone for at least 12 weeks and had at least 10 weekly urine drug screens during that time. After informed consent, in an approximate 3-hour session, participants will undergo collection of blood or a buccal swab for DNA extraction and analysis (blood is preferred, but buccal extraction enables inclusion of participants with poor venous access) and will complete 3 questionnaires; the Addiction Severity Index, the Perceived Neighborhood Scale, and sections of the Diagnostic Instrument for Genetic Studies.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

The study population was patients referring to Professor Kojuri Cardiovascular Clinic in Shiraz, Iran (email: kojurij@yahoo.com, webpage: http://kojuriclinic.com). A database of patients' information is available, including underlying diseases, signs and symptoms, medications, laboratory tests, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. The data is documented by expert cardiologists on every patient's visit.

The inclusion criteria were having a history of COVID-19 infection confirmed by PCR or suggested by HRCT findings and having been afflicted with COVID-19 at least one year ago. The exclusion criteria were having a history of documented COVID-19 infection, which occurred less than a year ago, and having a probable history of COVID-19 not confirmed by PCR or HRCT.

Patients' information before COVID-19 infection was extracted from the database, including baseline demographic data, COVID-19 vaccination history, hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia (or hyperlipidemia (HLP)), diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, CVD, and prescribed medications. Patients with incomplete data before COVID-19 or with outdated data were excluded.

We contacted the enrolled patients to get informed about their symptoms, such as dyspnea at rest, dyspnea on exertion (DOE), orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) 21, chest pain (CP) 22, fatigue 23, and palpitations 24. Patients were asked to rate their dyspnea at rest from 0 to 10, according to the 10-category ratio. A score of zero means no breathing discomfort, and ten indicates the most severe dyspnea. A score between 1 to 4 was considered mild, 5 to 6 moderate, and 7 to 10 severe. We also used functional class 1 to 4 to assess their dyspnea. Functional class 1 means no limitations in daily activities, functional class 2 means mild exertional dyspnea, functional class 3 indicates moderate dyspnea with daily activities, and functional class 4 figures dyspnea at rest 25. Chest pain was defined, based on the American heart association 2021, as ""noncardiac,"" ""possible cardiac,"" and ""cardiac"" 22.

A history of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) during a year follow-up of COVID-19 infection and admission due to COVID-19 were also reported. MACE is defined as myocardial infarction (MI), admission due to heart failure (HF), stroke, cardiac death, and revascularization procedures, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 26.

HTN is defined as clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg in repeated assessment 27. DM is diagnosed based on the American diabetes association (ADA) 2020 guidelines 28. Dyslipidemia is defined as abnormalities in TG, LDL, or HDL cholesterol. A TG level of more than 150 mg/dL is considered abnormal. HDL less than 40 mg/dL, LDL more than 100mg/dL, or is defined as dyslipidemia 29. Current smokers are defined as those who have smoked ≥100 cigarettes and smoked during the 30 days preceding the study. Former smokers have stopped smoking more than 30 days before the research 30.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows ver. 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). We described continuous variables by mean ±standard deviation. Categorical variables were described by frequency and percentage. We used repeated measure ANOVA and paired-sample t-test for normal distribution variables and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for repeated categorical variables. Pearson's chi-squared test and Kruskal-Wallis test are applied to categorical data. We controlled the effects of confounding factors by using generalized linear models and repeating analyses by different subgroups. Statistical significance was indicated when P\<0.05.

A score between 1 to 4 was considered mild, 5 to 6 moderate, and 7 to 10 severe. We also used functional class 1 to 4 to assess their dyspnea. Functional class 1 means no limitations in daily activities, functional class 2 means mild exertional dyspnea, functional class 3 indicates moderate dyspnea with daily activities, and functional class 4 figures dyspnea at rest 25. Chest pain was defined, based on the American heart association 2021, as ""noncardiac,"" ""possible cardiac,"" and ""cardiac"" 22. A history of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) during a year follow-up of COVID-19 infection and admission due to COVID-19 were also reported. MACE is defined as myocardial infarction (MI), admission due to heart failure (HF), stroke, cardiac death, and revascularization procedures, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 26. HTN is defined as clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg in repeated assessment 27. DM is diagnosed based on the American diabetes association (ADA) 2020 guidelines 28. Dyslipidemia is defined as abnormalities in TG, LDL, or HDL cholesterol. A TG level of more than 150 mg/dL is considered abnormal. HDL less than 40 mg/dL, LDL more than 100mg/dL, or is defined as dyslipidemia 29. Current smokers are defined as those who have smoked ≥100 cigarettes and smoked during the 30 days preceding the study. Former smokers have stopped smoking more than 30 days before the research 30. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows ver. 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). We described continuous variables by mean ±standard deviation. Categorical variables were described by frequency and percentage. We used repeated measure ANOVA and paired-sample t-test for normal distribution variables and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for repeated categorical variables. Pearson's chi-squared test and Kruskal-Wallis test are applied to categorical data. We controlled the effects of confounding factors by using generalized linear models and repeating analyses by different subgroups. Statistical significance was indicated when P\<0.05. All patients were informed about the details of this research and provided their informed consent.

According to previous studies, anywhere from 20-60% of breast surgery patients report mastalgia as an adverse outcome of surgery (1, 2). Although the exact mechanism has not been well defined, the pain is generally neuropathic in nature and described as a burning sensation, electric and shock like, with a stabbing quality (2,3). The large majority of post-operative mastalgia is therefore believed to be secondary to nerve damage, particularly injury to the intercostobrachial nerve, and less commonly the long thoracic, medial and lateral pectoral, and/or the thoracodorsal nerves. Other reported causes of post-operative breast pain include scarring pain, lymphedema, radiation plexopathy, and hematomas (1-5).

Increasing rates of breast surgeries, whether elective, diagnostic, prophylactic, or therapeutic, warrant a more detailed examination of this pain-syndrome, particularly as previous research in the area is rather limited and narrow. A better understanding of the potential mechanisms causing pain, as well as more accurate and current incidence rates, and comparisons of adverse outcomes among the various options available to patients can help guide physicians towards improved clinical practices and patients towards more informed decision-making. Therefore, we designed this prospective cohort study to better understand the underlying mechanisms which may cause post-operative pain after various types of breast surgeries including breast biopsy, lumpectomy, mastectomy, mastectomy with reconstruction, cosmetic augmentation, and breast reduction, as well as to compare and contrast incidence, quality, and distribution of the post-operative pain caused by these various surgical procedures.","Inclusion Criteria:

The relationship between metabolic and mood disorders may be mediated by endogenous opioid activity in limbic brain regions. We propose to examine affective state and μ- opioid system function in insulin resistant women, and change in response to insulin sensitizing treatment, through the following specific aims and hypotheses:

Establish relationship between insulin resistance, affective state, and μ-opioid receptor function.

1. Insulin resistant women will have greater μ-opioid receptor availability at baseline, and a larger response to stress challenge than non-insulin resistant women
2. Insulin resistant women will have greater negative affective state at baseline, and a greater emotional response to stress challenge than non-insulin resistant women.
3. Mediational analyses will reveal that the relationship between insulin resistance and negative affect is mediated by μ-opioid receptor function and neural activation in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens affect-regulating regions.

Examine effects of insulin regulation on μ-opioid receptor function and affective state.

1. Improved insulin sensitivity will be accompanied by decreased μ-opioid receptor availability at baseline and a reduced response to stress challenge. Degree of change in baseline receptor availability and response to stress challenge after treatment will correlate with degree of insulin regulation.
2. Improved insulin sensitivity will be associated with improved affective state at baseline, and with a reduced emotional response to stress challenge. Degree of change in affective state and emotional response to stress challenge after treatment will correlate with degree of insulin regulation.
3. Mediational analyses will reveal that the change in affective state after insulin regulation is mediated by change in μ-opioid receptor function and neural activation in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens.

The expected results would suggest a role for the endogenous μ-opioid system in mediating the relationship between metabolic function and emotional processes.","The objective of this study is to examine the role of the endogenous mu-opioid system in mediating the relationship between metabolic dysfunction and depressive symptoms in reproductive aged women.

"Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany",INDUSTRY,NCT01111084,"A Prospective, Multi-centric Observational Study to Determine the Mono-bifollicular Development in Infertile Women Subjected to Ovulation Induction With Follitropin α",Prospective Multi-centre Observational Study to Determine the Mono-bifollicular Development in Infertile Women Subjected to Ovulation Induction With Follitropin α,This is a prospective and multicentric observational study to determine the real mono-bifollicular development rate that is obtained under normal care conditions following ovulation induction (OI) treatment with follitropin-alpha filled by mass prescribed in accordance with standard practice.,"In women with infertility due to anovulation, the main purpose of ovulation induction (OI) consists in inducing the mono or bifollicular and the subsequent ovulation in order to achieve pregnancy. The availability of recombinant gonadotropins obtained using genetically engineered techniques has meant a decisive and clear pharmacological advancement. Use of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) offers a greater effectiveness (greater number of follicles/ ovocytes and a higher pregnancy rate) and efficiency (fewer number of blisters, fewer stimulation days; fewer number of cancellations and complications) in programmed coitus and artificial insemination like in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)/intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) techniques. Further advances in obtaining better products for ovarian stimulation has led to production of a recombinant FSH (follitropin alpha) filled by mass preparation. This hormone becomes the most consistent and precise gonadotropin due to improvements in its quantification process.

Today, despite having accurate and modern tools for ovulation induction, in daily practice, doctors continue to ""fight"" against two old problems of assisted reproduction: multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Application of assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) and the use of medication that induce ovulation, risk producing gestations and multiple births with a higher frequency than those observed in spontaneous gestations. One of the facts that result in the appearance of such problems is the high incidence of polycystic ovarian syndrome among the population of women who are infertile due to anovulation. These subjects are especially sensitive to ovarian stimulation, which leads to multiple follicular development, a higher risk of hyperstimulation and higher rates of multiple pregnancies.

Therefore, it seems clear that the search for developing mono or bifollicular cycles is important in ovarian induction cycles, for the purpose of preventing the above mentioned multiple pregnancy problems and the risk of OHSS. The intent of this study was to figure out the real mono-bifollicular development rate that is obtained under normal care conditions following OI treatment with follitropin alpha filled by mass prescribed in accordance with standard practice. Therefore, a measure of the efficiency of the product for achieving the development of one or two follicles. Data was collected from 56 centres of the Autonomous Communities that accepted this observational study, until achieving a total of 410 ovulation induction cycles.

OBJECTIVES

Primary objective:

* To find the real proportion of cycles with mono-bifollicular development during the provision of care involving OI with follitropin alpha filled by mass

Secondary objectives:

* To evaluate if the use of follitropin alpha filled by mass has other clinical benefits such as a reduction in the number of cancelled cycles, of the dosage and time required and adverse effects","Inclusion Criteria:

* Premenopausal women with infertility caused by anovulation, who wished to conceive and were included in an ovulation induction (OI) treatment protocol for intrauterine insemination or for programmed coitus

In women with infertility due to anovulation, the main purpose of ovulation induction (OI) consists in inducing the mono or bifollicular and the subsequent ovulation in order to achieve pregnancy. The availability of recombinant gonadotropins obtained using genetically engineered techniques has meant a decisive and clear pharmacological advancement. Use of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) offers a greater effectiveness (greater number of follicles/ ovocytes and a higher pregnancy rate) and efficiency (fewer number of blisters, fewer stimulation days; fewer number of cancellations and complications) in programmed coitus and artificial insemination like in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)/intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) techniques. Further advances in obtaining better products for ovarian stimulation has led to production of a recombinant FSH (follitropin alpha) filled by mass preparation. This hormone becomes the most consistent and precise gonadotropin due to improvements in its quantification process. Today, despite having accurate and modern tools for ovulation induction, in daily practice, doctors continue to ""fight"" against two old problems of assisted reproduction: multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Application of assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) and the use of medication that induce ovulation, risk producing gestations and multiple births with a higher frequency than those observed in spontaneous gestations. One of the facts that result in the appearance of such problems is the high incidence of polycystic ovarian syndrome among the population of women who are infertile due to anovulation. These subjects are especially sensitive to ovarian stimulation, which leads to multiple follicular development, a higher risk of hyperstimulation and higher rates of multiple pregnancies. Therefore, it seems clear that the search for developing mono or bifollicular cycles is important in ovarian induction cycles, for the purpose of preventing the above mentioned multiple pregnancy problems and the risk of OHSS. The intent of this study was to figure out the real mono-bifollicular development rate that is obtained under normal care conditions following OI treatment with follitropin alpha filled by mass prescribed in accordance with standard practice. Therefore, a measure of the efficiency of the product for achieving the development of one or two follicles. Data was collected from 56 centres of the Autonomous Communities that accepted this observational study, until achieving a total of 410 ovulation induction cycles. OBJECTIVES Primary objective: * To find the real proportion of cycles with mono-bifollicular development during the provision of care involving OI with follitropin alpha filled by mass Secondary objectives: * To evaluate if the use of follitropin alpha filled by mass has other clinical benefits such as a reduction in the number of cancelled cycles, of the dosage and time required and adverse effects Inclusion Criteria: * Premenopausal women with infertility caused by anovulation, who wished to conceive and were included in an ovulation induction (OI) treatment protocol for intrauterine insemination or for programmed coitus Exclusion Criteria: * Subjects with hypersensitivity to follitropin alpha, to FSH or to any of the excipients * Subjects with hypothalamic or pituitary tumours * Subjects with increase in the size of the ovaries or cysts that were not due to polycystic ovary disease * Subjects with gynaecologic haemorrhages of unknown aetiology * Subjects with ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma * Subjects with primary ovarian failure * Subjects with malformations of sex organs that were not compatible with pregnancy * Subjects with uterine fibroid tumours that were not compatible with pregnancy"

R-Pharm,INDUSTRY,NCT03669484,Comparative Clinical Study of Efficacy and Safety of Remimazolam and Propofol in Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery Under General Anaesthesia,International Multicenter Single Blind Randomized Clinical Study to Compare Efficacy and Safety of Remimazolam and Propofol in Patients Undergoing Elective Surgical Procedures Under General Anesthesia,The purpose of this study was to perform comparative evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety of Remimazolam and Propofol for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia.,"Only patients with scheduled operations were screened for eligibility in this study. Screening period for each patient lasted from 1 to 14 days. All patients eligible as per protocol criteria were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive investigational or reference drug. Randomisation was carried out in admission to the operating room - Day1.

For the induction of anesthesia, first there was administration of the trial drug / reference drug, then - administration of a narcotic analgesic (fentanyl at a dose of 2 mg/kg), after which after loss of consciousness, muscle relaxant was used (rocuronium bromide at a dose of 0.6-0.9 mg/kg). Tracheal intubation was performed after achieving the necessary relaxation of the muscles.

Maintenance of anesthesia during surgery was done using the trial drug / reference drug, muscle relaxant (rocuronium bromide - if necessary, during the anesthesia maintenance, the dose was selected individually) and narcotic analgetic (fentanyl, if necessary, during the anesthesia maintenance, the dose was selected individually). To control patient's condition before, during and after surgery, the significant vital parameters were monitored (level of blood pressure and heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, saturation, intraoperative ECG, bispectral index (BIS)).

After the operation patients were transferred to the postoperation room where the assessment of the operation memory, and possible presence of postoperative delirium was performed as well as on Day 2. Further treatment and determination of compliance of patient's condition with the criteria for discharge from the hospital was carried out in accordance with current practice of the center.

In 7 (± 2) days after the end of trial drugs administration, patient's condition monitoring and safety evaluation were carried out through telephone contact with the patient, during which data on adverse events and concomitant therapy were collected. Scheduled trial duration for each patient was a maximum of 24 days.

Therapy was considered ineffective, if other sedatives were required for induction (loss of consciousness was not registered after study drugs dose adjustment) and/or maintenance of the required level of sedation during anesthesia (in case of signs of awakening appeared and remained after study drugs dose adjustment).

Therapy efficacy evaluation was based on primary and secondary efficacy criteria. Effect of general anesthetic, a combined evaluation criterion consisted of the following criteria.

Treatment of eyes with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma remains a challenge. The historic standard of care for patients with unilateral disease is enucleation and for those with bilateral disease, a variety of modalities have been tried. These include radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy, periocular administration of chemotherapy, selective intra-arterial chemotherapy, and intravitreal chemotherapy. Unfortunately, all of these modalities are associated with significant morbidity and investigators are looking for new ways to treat these patients either with novel directed drug delivery methods or with new less toxic agents. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of topotecan delivered directly to the eye using a novel sustained-release topotecan episcleral plaque (also referred to as a Chemoplaque) in patients with active residual or recurrent intraocular retinoblastoma in at least one eye following completion of first-line therapy. The study intervention involves the insertion and removal of the Chemoplaque, examinations under anaesthesia (EUAs), visits to clinic to monitor for adverse events throughout, and post plaque removal toxicity evaluation. EUAs, clinic visits and laboratory tests are standard of care for retinoblastoma patients.","Inclusion Criteria:

1. Age. Participants must be \<18 years of age.

Retinoblastoma is the most common pediatric malignant intraocular tumour and originates from the retina. Treatment of eyes with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma remains a challenge. The historic standard of care for patients with unilateral disease is enucleation and for those with bilateral disease, a variety of modalities have been tried. These include radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy, periocular administration of chemotherapy, selective intra-arterial chemotherapy, and intravitreal chemotherapy. Unfortunately, all of these modalities are associated with significant morbidity and investigators are looking for new ways to treat these patients either with novel directed drug delivery methods or with new less toxic agents. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of topotecan delivered directly to the eye using a novel sustained-release topotecan episcleral plaque (also referred to as a Chemoplaque) in patients with active residual or recurrent intraocular retinoblastoma in at least one eye following completion of first-line therapy. The study intervention involves the insertion and removal of the Chemoplaque, examinations under anaesthesia (EUAs), visits to clinic to monitor for adverse events throughout, and post plaque removal toxicity evaluation. EUAs, clinic visits and laboratory tests are standard of care for retinoblastoma patients. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Age. Participants must be \<18 years of age. 2. Diagnosis and Treatment. Participants must have: (i) active residual or recurrent intraocular retinoblastoma following completion of first-line therapy (chemotherapy, systemic or intra-arterial, focal therapy or brachytherapy), or (ii) unilateral Group B, C, D or cT1b, cT2 retinoblastoma at diagnosis with no previous treatment. 3. One eye will be the Study Eye. When participants have two eyes with retinoblastoma, the eye with worst disease or best vision potential will be designated the Study Eye. There will only be one eye per child treated in this Phase I study, since treatment of two eyes would double the systemic dose of drug. The Non-study eye will be treated by standard of care, with only focal therapy during the Study Period, if required. 4. Disease status. Study eye must have vision potential and no clinical features suggestive of high risk of extraocular extension. 5. Performance status. Lansky play score ≥ 50 if \<16 years of age; Karnofsky performance scale of ≥ 50 if ≥16 years of age (Appendix I) 6. Organ function: 1. Adequate bone marrow function and platelet count 2. Adequate renal function 3. Adequate liver function 7. Pregnancy prevention. Females of reproductive potential must agree to the use of highly effective contraception during study participation and for an additional 40 days after the end of the Chemoplaque administration 8. Informed consent. All participants and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Assent, where appropriate, will also be obtained. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Disease status. Participants known to have any of the following are excluded: 1. clinical or EUA evidence of extraocular extension 2. known metastatic disease status and intercurrent illness 3. existing clinical and neuroimaging showing suspicion of, or definitive, 2. Allergy. Participants with reported allergy to topotecan, camptothecin or derivatives thereof. 3. Concomitant treatment. Participants may not receive chemotherapy or other focal retinoblastoma therapy or any other investigational agent within 3 weeks of the placement and removal of the Chemoplaque, nor while the Chemoplaque is in situ. 4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness. Participants with known uncontrolled intercurrent illness that, in the investigator's opinion, would put the participant at undue risk or limit compliance with the study requirements. 5. Febrile illness. Participants with clinically significant febrile illness (as determined by the investigator) within one week prior to initiation of protocol therapy. 6. Pregnancy and lactation. Females of reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to initiation of protocol therapy. Due to the unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study agents, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated on study. 7.
