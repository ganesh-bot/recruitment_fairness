It is a pre-malignant condition and may progress to low grade dysplasia, high grade dysplasia and ultimately esophageal adenocarcinoma which has poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of only 5-20%.Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a standard modality and well-studied endoscopic treatment for dysplastic BE. While the rate of complete eradication of dysplasia has been reported to be between 78% - 94% with RFA, the rate of complications associated with this procedure has been reported to be as high as 19.1%, and the costs are high. In a randomized clinical trial in patients with BE and low-grade dysplasia by Phoa et al in 2014, 68 patients underwent radiofrequency ablation therapy with a median of three ablation sessions per patient while 68 patients were randomized to endoscopic surveillance. In this study, a total of 13 patients (19.1%) experienced an adverse event in the treatment group versus no adverse events in the control group. Eight patients (11.8%) developed esophageal strictures which required a median of one dilation, three patients were noted to have small mucosal lacerations, one patient developed retrosternal pain treated with analgesics while one patient developed abdominal pain requiring hospitalization and treatment with analgesia. Several other studies have reported the rate of complications ranging between 5% to 19.1% and stricture formation being the most common among them.

OTHER,NCT05474079,Exercise Training & Statins for Cardiovascular Health,The Effects of Supervised Exercise Training in the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Stain-Users and Non Statin-Users,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers to any condition that affects the heart and/or blood vessels (e.g. heart attack, stroke) and is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Regular exercise and statin therapy are widely recommended as frontline prevention strategies to reduce CVD risk. Recent changes to National Health Service (NHS) healthcare guidelines state that even individuals with a relatively low risk of CVD (≥10% risk score) should take a statin. When prescribed after a heart attack or stroke, both exercise and statins reduce the risk of a CVD-related death by \~25%, with some evidence to suggest that the combination of these therapies may offer additive cardiovascular protection. However, far less is known about the combined effects of exercise and statin therapy in primary CVD prevention (i.e. before a CVD event). Poor blood vessel function represents the earliest stage of CVD, which can be measured with ultrasound at different regions of the body (limbs, brain, heart) to sensitively detect early CVD risk. Regular exercise provides a variety of cardiovascular benefits and has a direct therapeutic effect on blood vessel function. In contrast, statin therapy primarily reduces CVD risk by lowering cholesterol, which may also improve blood vessel function. Although both therapies can separately reduce CVD risk, the interaction between exercise training and statin therapy on blood vessel function has never been directly compared in the setting of primary prevention, and it's currently unknown whether a combination of both therapies offers additional cardiovascular benefit. Therefore, the main aims of this study are to (i) investigate the effect of supervised exercise training on blood vessel function (limbs, brain, heart) in individuals with a CVD-risk score of ≥10% and (ii) examine whether these exercise effects differ in individuals taking a statin compared to those not taking a statin.","Over 340,000 people in Wales live with cardiovascular disease (CVD). It causes 28% of all annual deaths and costs the Welsh NHS £469 million per year (British Heart Foundation, 2019). Physical inactivity causes a third of all CVD cases and only 53% of Welsh adults currently meet the recommended minimum physical activity guidelines (Statistics for Wales, 2019). Accordingly, Wales is the most physically inactive nation in the UK with one of the highest rates of CVD. Regular exercise is widely recommended by GPs as a frontline prevention strategy to reduce CVD-risk. Similarly, statins are also routinely prescribed as part of primary healthcare across the UK to lower cholesterol levels and reduce CVD-risk. Recent changes to NHS primary healthcare guidelines state that even individuals with a relatively low risk of CVD (10-year CVD-risk score ≥10%; QRISK3) should take a statin. When prescribed after a heart attack or stroke, both exercise and statins reduce the risk of a CVD-related death by \~25%; some evidence suggests that the combination of these therapies may offer additive cardiovascular protection. However, far less is known about the combined effects of exercise and statin therapy in primary CVD prevention.

Sensitive ultrasound techniques can be used to examine vascular, cerebrovascular and cardiac structure and function to provide a comprehensive overview of cardiovascular health. Poor vascular function represents the earliest stage of CVD and is more sensitive at detecting CVD risk than traditional risk factors. Regular exercise provides a variety of cardiovascular benefits and has a direct therapeutic effect on vascular function. In contrast, statin therapy primarily reduces CVD-risk by lowering cholesterol, which may also improve vascular function. Although both therapies can separately reduce CVD risk, the interaction between exercise training and statin therapy on vascular function has never been directly compared in the setting of primary prevention; and it is currently unknown whether a combination of both therapies offers additional cardiovascular benefit.

This study will utilise a comprehensive series of cutting-edge vascular, cerebrovascular and cardiac ultrasound techniques to examine the effectiveness of exercise and statin therapy as primary CVD prevention strategies. If results demonstrate that exercise training provides similar cardiovascular benefits to statin therapy, and/or the combination of these preventive strategies offer additive benefit, this could have considerable implications on primary prevention healthcare recommendations.",RECRUITING,,2022-07-20,2026-01-01,2025-01-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,PREVENTION,80,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Moderate intensity exercise training"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""The exercise training program will consist of individually tailored, progressive moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.

OTHER,NCT04275479,Diabetes/ Endocrine Surveillance in SDS,Endocrine Diabetes Screening in Patients With Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome DIABETES/ ENDOCRINE SURVEILLANCE IN SDS,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome(SDS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder involving primarily the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome gene located on chromosome 7q11. The gene effects function of the 60S ribosome by interfering with the function of the Guanasine triphosphatase elongation factor 1 in the release of eukaryotic initiation factor 6 from the 60 S ribosomal subunit for translation initiation. Seventy five percent of the individual affected by the syndrome have a biallelic mutation (258+2T\>C and 183-184T \> CT). The syndrome results in defects primarily in the pancreas and bone marrow resulting in pancreatic insufficiency, leukopenia with an increased risk of infection and an increased risk for acute myelocytic leukemia. Animal models that have knocked out the function of the SBDS gene in the pancreas reveals at the pancreas at birth as well as the insulin producing cells in the pancreas are normal but subsequently developed fatty infiltration and apoptosis without inflammation resulting in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with initially normal endocrine pancreatic function. The endocrine pancreatic function declines over time such that by 12 months of age these mice show a phenotype of impaired glucose tolerance. The finding of early onset diabetes is not yet considered a manifestation of this genetic defect but likely is occurring. This study is designed to assist in understanding the prevalence of glucose abnormalities in this syndrome.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency leading to diabetes is a common hallmark of cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis related diabetes. Prevalence of glucose abnormalities in diabetes is a approaching 50% by the 2nd and 3rd decade of life in this disorder. The cystic fibrosis Foundation recommend screening for diabetes utilizing an oral glucose tolerance by the age of 10. Early diagnosis of diabetes in the syndrome as resulted in improved outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis. It is my expectation that the prevalence of diabetes will be similar in SBDS patients. A small study performed I had the University of Cincinnati showed glucose abnormalities to occur in 5/20 individuals with the classic mutation.

Investigators propose to screen patients with the classic mutation for diabetes and endocrine disease utilizing continuous glucose monitoring over a 14 day period in addition to baseline fasting blood tests for insulin, GAD 65 antibody, Fructosamine, A1c and C peptide.","The purpose of the study is to learn about how common early onset diabetes and other endocrine issues occur in people who have been diagnosed with SDS.

Currently, the diagnosis of OSA relies on polysomnography (PSG) and manual scoring, which are constrained by equipment availability and personnel shortages, resulting in low efficiency, high costs, and scheduling difficulties. Additionally, PSG monitoring requires numerous contact-based sensors, leading to poor patient compliance. The lack of large-scale screening and long-term follow-up further restricts the implementation of standardized and evidence-based treatments. Developing new, effective, low- or zero-burden sleep monitoring devices to minimize sleep disruption while ensuring monitoring accuracy is, therefore, a key direction for future research.

The Five Seasons Sleep Tracking Mat (5S Sleep Tracking Mat) detects heartbeats, respiration, body movements, and snoring using ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals. The device is composed primarily of a control unit, monitoring mat, temperature/humidity sensor, power adapter, and light sensor. During operation, the device accurately captures the impact force of bodily movements at a high sampling rate of 2 kHz. It then uses proprietary signal processing and pre-trained AI models to extract heartbeat and respiratory waveforms, as well as body movements. Additionally, it automatically detects respiratory events, calculates the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and determines sleep stages. Since the monitoring mat only needs to be placed under the pillow without requiring direct contact with the body or wearable accessories, it is particularly suitable for home-based, long-term daily sleep monitoring.

The investigators will test the hypothesise that a higher resistance exercise frequency will result in greater muscle protein synthesis rates than a lower resistance exercise frequency.,"Resistance exercise is currently the most effective means of building or maintaining muscle mass. Resistance exercise guidelines generally suggest that those looking to increase muscle mass should train each muscle group once to twice per week. However, it has been proposed that it may be of greater benefit to train a muscle group with a higher frequency (i.e., four to six times per week) than currently suggested. If true, completing the same total volume of resistance exercise in more frequent, smaller bouts could prove to be a more beneficial strategy to optimally build or maintain muscle mass.

In this country, a large-scale screening of precancerous lesions with cytology is hardly possible, because of the lack of specialists and infrastructures. Visual inspection of the cervix with application of 5% acetic acid (VIA) is an inexpensive alternative but very subjective since it depends on the examiner's experience.

Objective: To assess if Smartphone may assist health-care worker (on-site) and to evaluate the diagnostic reliability and accuracy of cervical examination with smartphone photos of VIA (D-VIA) compared with conventional VIA, for women testing positive for human papillomavirus (HPV).

Material and method: On-site health care workers will be trained in VIA.

OTHER,NCT02780479,Steroids in Children Hospitalized With Asthma,Oral Dexamethasone Versus Oral Prednisone in Children Hospitalized With Asthma: A Randomized Control Study,"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children. A short (3-5 day) course of a short-acting steroid such as Prednisone or Prednisolone has long been the standard of care for asthma exacerbation. Dexamethasone efficacy in asthma exacerbation has been studied in the outpatient setting and was found to be as effective as Prednisone. Dexamethasone has the advantage of shorter course, more compliance, and more tolerable. This has led many emergency departments to provide a 1-2 dose course of Dexamethasone on discharge. Thus, many inpatients have received a first dose of Dexamethasone prior to reaching the inpatient unit, leading to confusion about the best plan for these patients. Many hospitalist pediatricians continue to give a 5-day total course with Prednisone, but some patients have begun to receive a second dose of Dexamethasone 24 hours after the first dose. To our knowledge, no studies have been done to compare the efficacy of these two protocols in pediatric patients requiring hospitalization. The hypothesis is that a second dose of Dexamethasone is as effective as four additional days of Prednisone in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbation. This is an open label, randomized control study comparing these treatments in children age 2-18 hospitalized with asthma exacerbation who have received a first dose of Dexamethasone.","Corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for managing acute asthma exacerbations. Studies have shown that systemic steroids effect decrease relapse and hospital admission. Due to its short half-life, Prednisone is usually given daily or twice daily for 3-5 days. It has been associated with poor compliance due it the prolonged course. Dexamethasone half-life is 36 - 72 hours.

Several studies have shown no difference in outcomes between 3-5 days of prednisone and different forms of dexamethasone, including single intramuscular dose or single oral dose or two oral doses 1 day apart. However, those studies were done in the emergency department (ED). Lack of response to initial asthma treatment in ED results in admission to the hospital, implying more severe exacerbation than those able to be discharged. Some clinician shift to oral prednisone once admitted to the floor for patients who have received Dexamethasone or not. Others have begin to complete the Dexamethasone course with one more dose of Dexamethasone 24 hour after the first dose. Dexamethasone has the advantage of compliance and tolerability, however, no studies investigated its efficacy in hospitalized patients. Such knowledge will improve patient's compliance and outcomes.

* Sample size calculation: Primary outcome of return to normal activities within 3 days of discharge. Based on previous studies, it is estimated that 70% of the control group will achieve this goal. Based on a minimum absolute difference of 15%, and a power of 0.80, the sample size calculated to be 117 in each arm. Assuming 20% lost to follow up, it is intended to recruit 150 in each arm (total 300 subjects).

Renal osteodystrophy is a complex disease, in which multiple mineral systems and related hormones play a role, including phosphate homeostasis. Phosphate regulation primarily depends on renal handling of phosphate, which is partly controlled by parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. However, other mediators in this system clearly exist. Recently, evidence has been accruing that one such factor may be FGF23, a protein produced by osteogenic cells. States of excess FGF23 are associated with marked phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, and inappropriately low calcitriol. FGF23 levels are measurable in healthy humans and markedly elevated in patients who require hemodialysis, although its physiologic role in either state is unknown. Some retrospective evidence suggests that FGF23 is affected by phosphate intake. We are performing a study to gather data describing the response of FGF23 to changes in dietary phosphorus intake in healthy men and women and in men and women with moderate renal insufficiency. The specific aims of this pilot study are: 1) To examine the physiologic effects of alterations in dietary phosphorus on FGF23 in healthy subjects; 2) To examine the physiologic response of FGF23 to dietary phosphorus alterations in patients with moderate renal failure; and 3) To assess whether serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D vary inversely with those of FGF23 when dietary phosphate is changed.

A Retrospective Data Analysis.","To study the correlation between colloid osmotic pressure, albumin and the loss of vascular integrity in terms of endothelial dysfunction in patients with ESLD undergoing OLT and its impact on the perioperative course, as well as on morbidity and mortality.","Patients suffering from end-stage liver disease (ESLD) are critically ill. Still, therapeutic options are limited, no organ replacement procedure is available and orthotopic liver transplantation remains the unique therapy of choice.

ESLD is associated with a myriad of comorbidities, and is characterized by imbalances in the acid-base- status, coagulopathy, metabolic disorders and activation of the pro-inflammatory cascade. ESLD represents a state of generalized systemic inflammation subsequently leading to endothelial dysfunction and capillary leak syndrome, potentially culminating in end-organ dysfunction.

Furthermore, patients with ESLD suffer from reduced regenerative and synthetic capacity/ability, which is reflected by the serum albumin deficiency. Serum albumin is the most important plasma protein, is produced exclusively in the liver, and houses various physiological functions: it owns immunological, immuno-modulating and anti-inflammatory properties, transport capacities, as well as detoxifying qualities. However, the most well known property of human serum albumin is maintaining the colloid osmotic pressure (COP). In the healthy individual, serum albumin is responsible for 75% up to 80% of the COP, whereas in the critically ill, the percentage proportion drops down to 17%. The COP itself accounts for the regulation and distribution of the plasma volume and is therefore essential in maintaining the vascular stability and integrity. Additionally, the endothelial glycocalyx is necessary in the context of safeguarding the endothelial function and regulating the vascular permeability. The glycocalyx covers the endothelium luminally and its core component is the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-1. Under various clinical conditions, like ischemia/reperfusion, inflammation, sepsis, shock, major surgery, hypervolemia, degradation to the glycocalyx may happen. These pathophysiological circumstances may lead to loss of the endothelial integrity and consecutively to capillary-leak syndrome causing a loss of albumin and fluid extravasation/shifts. Various clinical and experimental studies could show that global, as well as regional ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion-phase, both lead to glycocalyx-shedding, in terms of increased syndecan-1 plasma levels. Furthermore, a previous study from our study group clearly detected increased syndecan-1 plasma levels in patients with ESLD as surrogate parameter of glycocalyx degradation mirroring the state of chronic inflammation in this patient population.

Nevertheless, a clear correlation between colloid osmotic pressure, albumin and the loss of vascular integrity in state of endothelial dysfunction has not been studied before in patients with ESLD undergoing OLT.",COMPLETED,,2015-12-06,2016-12-06,2016-12-06,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,50,ACTUAL,[],,,1

OTHER,NCT03169179,Physical Activity Wearables in the Police Force: The PAW-Force Trial,Physical Activity Wearables in the Police Force: The PAW-Force Trial,"Policing is an increasingly sedentary occupation and high levels of physical and psychological morbidities are reported by officers and staff. Wearable fitness technology may be a feasible intervention to promote physical activity and improve health.

This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of introducing wearable fitness technology (Fitbit™ activity monitors linked to the 'Bupa Boost' smartphone app) as a motivator for increasing physical activity within the police force. Additional aims are to and to assess the potential impact of the intervention on physical activity, sedentary time, health and wellbeing, stress, sickness absence and self-perceived productivity, and to explore which motivational strategies (e.g. individual goal-setting vs. social competitions) are most acceptable and potentially effective and for which groups of staff.

A single-group, before and after, mixed methods exploratory trial will be conducted. Approximately 180 police officers and staff from two sites (Plymouth Basic Command Unit and North Dorset) will be recruited to take part. Participants will use the technology for 12 weeks initially followed by a further five months of optional use. A combination of questionnaire surveys, interviews and analysis of staff absence records will be used.

Data will be collected pre-intervention, mid-intervention (6 weeks), post-intervention (12 weeks) and follow-up (8 months). Primary outcomes are change in objectively recorded step count, self-reported physical activity and sedentary time. Secondary outcomes include general health and wellbeing, perceived stress and productivity, sickness absence, engagement with the intervention and perceived usability and usefulness.

This study will add to our understanding of the feasibility and acceptability of mobile fitness technology in a specific workplace setting, and inform a potential larger trial within the police force.","Background:

The workplace is increasingly seen as a setting for health promotion and preventive health activities, not only to prevent occupational injury, but also to improve people's overall health and wellbeing. The police force experiences higher than average rates of illness compared to the general population, including several common risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, in addition to high stress levels. Regular physical activity plays a pivotal role in the prevention and treatment of many health-related conditions and stress reduction.

The profile of crime is changing. Lower rates of street crime and increasing rates of white collar and cybercrime mean that the act of policing is becoming a more sedentary occupation. Police officers also experience a number of barriers to undertaking physical activity including long working hours, shift work, job pressures and lack of access to training facilities.

Wearable fitness technology (smartphone applications and personal physical activity monitors) provides people with accessible ways to engage with and monitor their physical activity at their convenience. There has been a recent proliferation of research into the application of such technology for behaviour change and health improvement. However, much of this research has so far been inconclusive. For studies that have reported significant effects, these have generally been modest and short-term. Remaining knowledge gaps include which strategies should be used to maintain motivation, and the impact of the technology within different populations and subgroups.

'Bupa Boost' is a smartphone application (app) run by the private health insurer Bupa. The app is a health and wellbeing tool designed for use in the workplace, which focuses on fitness, nutrition, mindfulness and relaxation. Devon and Cornwall Police and Dorset Police will work in partnership with Bupa, which will provide the app for free to staff and support research around the app. The organisations will supply a specific activity monitor (the Fitbit Charge 2™) to synchronise with the Bupa Boost app.

Bupa Boost contains several features or strategies intended to motivate behaviour change. For the purpose of this study and based on relevant theories, the features are categorised in two 'motivational frames':

1. Individual (goal-setting to earn points and virtual rewards such as badges)
2. Social (connecting with colleagues for support and to take part in competitive and collaborative/team challenges).

Objectives and Hypotheses:

This PhD project will conduct an exploratory trial to examine the feasibility and acceptability of introducing wearable fitness technology (personal activity monitors linked to a smartphone app) as a motivator for increasing physical activity within the police force. The trial will explore engagement and acceptability of the intervention in both the short and long term, including the maintenance of physical activity behaviours.

The work will include an exploratory analysis of a range of outcomes. It is predicted that the intervention will be associated with increased levels of physical activity, which will lead to improved health and wellbeing and reduced stress of staff, and an increase in productivity and reduction in sick leave and absenteeism across the organisations.

It is hypothesised that the different motivational strategies within the app (i.e. individual and social) will appeal to different individuals. Consequently, a further aim of this study is to explore which motivational strategies (i.e. individual and social) are most acceptable and potentially effective for different groups of police staff.

Secondary objectives are to gain an understanding of the wider context of physical activity within the police force through the identification of key barriers and facilitators, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention at various levels of the organisation, and to assess the feasibility and acceptability of trial methods to inform a potential larger scale trial.

Research Questions:

1. Is the wearing of a physical activity monitor (Fitbit Charge 2™) and use of the 'Bupa Boost' app a feasible and acceptable way to increase physical activity levels within the Devon and Cornwall and Dorset police forces?
2. What is the longer term engagement and acceptability of the intervention?
3. What is the potential impact of the intervention on physical activity (and sedentary time), and are physical activity levels maintained in the longer term?
4. Do increasing levels of physical activity impact positively on health, wellbeing and stress levels within the police force?
5. Are increased levels of physical activity associated with a healthier workplace, as measured by an increase in perceived productivity and reduction in sick leave and absenteeism?
6. What is the experience and impact of the different app-based motivational strategies (individual vs. social) on the level of physical activity undertaken by police staff, and are there any differences according to age, gender or occupation?
7. What are the key facilitators and barriers to physical activity within the police force?
8. What is the perceived feasibility and acceptability of the intervention at various levels of the organisation?
9. Do the findings indicate feasibility and acceptability for a larger scale trial of wearable fitness technology within the police force?

Research Methodology:

A single group exploratory trial with a pre- and post- evaluation (i.e. before and after use of the wearable fitness technology) will be conducted. Volunteer participants from two sites, Plymouth Basic Command Unit (urban) and North Dorset (rural), will receive the intervention, i.e. the Fitbit activity monitor and Bupa Boost app.

Following an initial week of wearing the activity monitor only (for baseline data collection), participants will take part in a 12 week intervention where the activity monitor will be linked to the Bupa Boost app. They will set specific goals including increasing their step count, and they will then be encouraged to engage with all of the motivational strategies within the 'individual' frame in weeks 1-6, followed by the 'social' frame in weeks 7-12. At the end of the 12 weeks, there will be a 5 month 'maintenance phase' during which participants may continue to use the device and app if and when they desire.

Participants will be instructed to use only the device they are given (Fitbit Charge 2™) and Bupa Boost, and to use only the features that relate to the 'individual' or 'social' motivational frame as appropriate. Data on step count will be directly collected by the device; participants will send this electronically to the researcher at four different time points - pre-intervention (baseline), mid-intervention (6 weeks), post-intervention (12 weeks) and follow-up (5 months post-intervention). They will also complete a range of online questionnaires relating to their physical activity levels, health and wellbeing, stress, perceived productivity and absenteeism at the same time points.

The duration of the study will be approximately 12 months and is part of a 36 month PhD. A small pilot study will be undertaken to ensure the data collection methods are acceptable.

With participants' permission, some data will also be collected from staff occupational health records. This will include sickness and absence time, and most common reasons for sickness absence before and after the intervention.

In addition to quantitative data, there will be a parallel qualitative study to gain an understanding of participants' expectations (before the intervention) and experiences (after the intervention) of the wearable fitness technology, and facilitators of and barriers to its use and participating in physical activity. This will involve interviews with a small sample, including participants who showed various levels of engagement. There will also be a small survey with managers, commissioners and occupational health staff within the police force to assess their perceptions of the usefulness, acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.

Analysis Plan:

A pre- and post-trial analysis will be undertaken. Baseline data will be compared with post-intervention and follow-up outcomes. An appropriate statistical method (e.g. paired t-test, repeated measures analysis of variance) will be selected for the primary outcome of step count. Inferential analysis will be used for key secondary outcomes (International Physical Activity Questionnaire outcomes, SF-12 health survey, Perceived Stress Scale, absenteeism and presenteeism) where possible.

Changes in outcomes between the two motivational frames will also be compared to assess their impact, and subgroup analysis will be used to explore any potential associations between varying effectiveness and sociodemographic factors (i.e. age, gender, occupation). All statistical analyses will be performed in Stata (version 14).

All interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed and a thematic and framework analysis will be undertaken.

Contribution and Justification of Benefit:

This research has the potential to fill some of the gaps in the existing evidence surrounding mobile fitness technology, including:

* Application of the technology to promote physical activity in a specific workplace setting;
* Identification of the preferred and potentially effective motivational/behaviour change strategies in this context;
* Sub-group differences - impact of the intervention and strategies according to age, gender and occupation;
* The study of both physical activity and sedentary behaviour (as the latter is an independent risk factor for poor health);
* Provide further insight into adherence to the use of wearable devices and mobile health technology and the longer-term impact on maintenance of physical activity

OTHER,NCT00253279,Alterations in Protein Synthesis Rates of Burn Patients Measured Over Time Using PET Scans,A Quantitative Study of the Metabolic Alterations in Protein Synthesis Rate That Occur in Burn Patients Over the Time Course of Their Injury Using Positron Emission Tomography.,Our specific aim is to gain an understanding of protein synthesis rates in burn patients at various times during their injury and recovery by using PET scans. This will be compared with healthy volunteer controls. We hope this will help optimize nutrition and care regimens for future burn patients.,"The purpose of this study is to understand how muscles are built up and broken down (metabolism) in both burn patients and healthy people.The studies will help us understand how muscle metabolism is different for burn patients and healthy subjects. We hope to find ways to help the body of a burn victim heal without losing too much muscle.

Protein is an important part of our daily diet. Normally, the body breaks down the protein we eat into smaller pieces called amino acids. It uses the amino acids to make its own proteins. It uses these proteins to heal wounds, fight infections, and provide energy.

After a burn injury, the body speeds up the pace of its life activities. It needs more energy just to stay alive and recover from the burn. The body often gets the extra energy it needs by breaking the protein in muscles down into amino acids. The amino acids are then made into new proteins. If too much muscle is broken down, it is harder for the body to function. This can make recovery slower or possibly lead to death.

For Healthy Volunteers, this study will require no more than 6 hours of time in total. This time will be spread out over two visits, a Screening Visit and a Scan Visit.

In this way it is possible to know which embryo or embryos have greater implantantion capacity and will be transferred to the uterus to obtain a viable pregnancy. However, these observations can produce deleterious effects on embryo development due to changes in temperature, pH and osmolarity of the culture media, as well as a negative effect of direct light microscope for observation. This project aims to test the hypothesis that non-embryonic observation produces a beneficial effect on embryo quality until day 5 of development (blastocyst stage) and, therefore, on rates of implantation and ongoing gestation, compared with the conventional protocol of observations under the inverted microscope on days two, three and five of development.","The present study is a prospective double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) approved by a local Ethics Committe. Summarily, in the control group we did three embryo observations outside the incubator as we usually do in our conventional protocol: day 2, day 3 and day 5, just before ET; in the study group we performed a unique embryo observation on day 5 before ET. All the subjects that participated in the study were informed and gave us their consent to take part on it.

The inclusion criteria of the study were: first cycle of ART treatment with conventional IVF or ICSI with donated eggs, normal uterine cavity and a single or double embryo transfer, always performed on day 5 at blastocyst stage.

The exclusion criteria were the following: patients above 50 years old, patients that were diagnosed with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and/or recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) or uterine pathologies, body mass index \>30 kg/m2, the use of seminal samples coming from donors or testicular origin and cycles that included preimplantational genetic testing (PGT).

LBR was the main outcome of our study, defined as the number of deliveries that resulted in a live born neonate, expressed per 100 embryo transfers (Zegers- Hochschild et al., 2009). Secondary efficacy endpoints were positive hCG rate (\>5 mUI/mL, assessed in serum 14 days after oocyte retrieval), implantation rate (number of gestational sacs observed divided by the number of embryos transferred, expressed as a percentage, %), ongoing pregnancy rate, defined as a pregnancy with a detectable heart rate at 12 weeks of gestation or beyond and miscarriage (loss of a pregnancy after 12 weeks of gestation).

In addition, we assessed the next IVF laboratory parameters: fertilization rate, blastocyst formation rate on day 5, blastocyst quality, number of transferred embryos and number of usable blastocysts (number of blastocysts transferred and frozen).

The sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome. We assumed a live birth rate of 40% in the control group, compared to 50% in the non-observational group deduced from previous studies. By applicating the sample size calculation program, 776 patients (388 per group) were required in order to detect a risk difference (RD) of 10% between the two groups in the final analysis, with a power of 80% at a two-sided, adjusted alpha-level of 0.05.

End-points evaluated at the end of each study period include urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE, mean of three 24-hrs collections), 24-hrs blood pressure (ABP); and GFR (51Cr-EDTA).","Aim:

The primary aim of our study is to evaluate the antiproteinuric effect of irbesartan 300, 600 and 900 mg once daily in type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. Secondary to evaluate the effect on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary TGF beta excretion, and markers of endothelial dysfunction, and finally to evaluate the association between treatment response and genotypes with possible implications for the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Patients 60 type 2 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria (at least two out of three 24-h urinary collections with albumin excretion between 30 and 300 mg/24-h).

Duration of study 38 weeks (8 weeks wash-out and 30 weeks of double-blind randomized cross-over (treatment with irbesartan 300, 600 and 900 mg for 10 weeks at each dose level)).

Design The study consists of an eight week wash-out period followed by a double-blind randomized three 10 week treatment period cross-over trial (please see enclosed flow chart).

Wash-out period: Eight weeks prior to randomization all previous antihypertensive medication is discontinued and replaced by hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily throughout the entire study period. Hydrochlorothiazide is added to reduce blood pressure elevation and edema formation during the trial and to eliminate the influence of varying dietary salt intake on the effects of irbesartan during the double blind treatment periods.

Double-blind cross-over periods: All patients receive treatment with irbesartan 300, 600 and 900 mg once daily in random order, without wash-out between treatment periods. All treatment periods are of 10 weeks duration. They consist of an initial two week titration period on irbesartan 300 mg o.d. to minimize the risk of adverse events including hypotension during cross-over in doses followed by an eight week period on the full dose for the given treatment level.

For safety reasons blood pressure, serum potassium and serum creatinine will be measured 4 weeks after the beginning of each treatment period (two weeks after the full dose of the treatment period is reached).

End-points are evaluated after the wash-out period (baseline) and at the end of each treatment period.

Methods Albuminuria is assessed by turbidimetry in three 24-h urinary samples. 24-h ambulatory blood pressure by the Takeda TM-2420/2421 device. GFR by plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA. DNA will be extracted from a venous sample to determine genotypes with possible implications for the risk of cardiovascular disease. Initially we will evaluate the influence of the ACE/ID- , Angiotensin II type I receptor (A1166C) - and the angiotensinogen (M235T) polymorphisms.

Researchers hope to use the results of this study to design more effective online health programs to provide middle and high school students with up-to-date information about tobacco use, meditation, and general health and well-being.","Participants complete up to 2 separate parts.

Part 1:

For Part 1, participants complete a survey about their mental and physical health and their opinions concerning health information and the internet. The survey takes about 15-20 minutes to complete.

Part 2:

If the results of the survey show eligibility, participants complete Part 2 of the study. For Part 2 participants are randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 2 study groups. Participants have a 1 in 3 chance of being assigned to receive standard care. Participants have a 2 in 3 chance of being assigned to use the ASPIRE website. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

If participant assigned to receive standard care, he or she is shown a website that has the same information presented in ASPIRE, but in text form.

Participants in both groups sit in front of a computer and go onto a website. Both the ASPIRE website and the text-based website have been designed for middle and high school students. The ASPIRE website has videos, activities, and health information facts about the effects of smoking, the benefits of meditation, and healthy living. The text-based website only has health information facts about smoking, the benefits of meditation, and healthy living. Participants complete 3 to 4 sessions using either the ASPIRE website or the text-based website throughout their first semester. Each session lasts about 40 minutes.

The use of the websites will be videotaped.

Follow-Up Surveys:

Participants complete a follow-up survey about their opinions concerning health information and the internet immediately after they complete their last session on the website. The follow-up surveys take about 15 minutes to complete.

Length of Study:

Active participation on this study is over after participants complete the follow-up survey. If participant does not continue onto Part 2 of the study, their active participation is over after they complete Part 1 of the study.

Other Information:

Participants take part in this study at their school during their after school program.

During the use of the website, each study participant is individually videotaped and audio recorded. The videotapes and audio recordings are used to help the research staff analyze each participant's use of the websites. The video tapes and audio recordings are stored on a password-protected encrypted hard drive that is stored in a locked office at MD Anderson. Only the study researcher and authorized members of the research staff are allowed to use the videotapes and audio recordings (for research purposes).",COMPLETED,,2013-12,2021-02-01,2021-02-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,700,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Surveys"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""At baseline participants complete survey about their mental and physical health and their opinions concerning health information and the internet.

OTHER,NCT04294979,Exercise Therapy in Multiple Sclerosis,"Study on the Interaction Between Immune, Autonomic and Central Nervous Systems as a Target of Exercise Therapy in Multiple Sclerosis","Exercise or active rehabilitation is a non-pharmacological approach increasingly used for people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), in support of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), with the aim of improving the quality of life and engagement in daily activities. Exercise improves several disease outcomes, like cardiovascular and neuromuscular functions and walking abilities. However, its disease modifying potential is poorly explored. Exercise might target two relevant disease hallmarks that are interconnected, such as the dysregulated immune system and the inflammatory synaptopathy. Exercise might act through the activation of the autonomic part of the vagus nerve, which is an important modulator of both the innate and adaptive immune system, through the so-called cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway-CAP.

This study aims to address the effect of exercise in reducing peripheral inflammation that drives the synaptic pathology and neurodegeneration occurring in the brain of MS patients. Patients will undergo a therapeutic exercise program, consisting of 3 hours of treatment per day, 6 days/week for a total of 6 weeks. The treatment will include both passive and active therapeutic exercises targeted to restore or preserve muscular flexibility, motor coordination and ambulatory function. The day of recruitment (time 0) patients will undergo neurological and mood examination and blood withdrawal to analyze peripheral markers of immune function. Moreover, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used to measure synaptic transmission, while the heart rate variability (HRV) test will be performed to explore vagal function. The effect of exercise will be evaluated at the end of rehabilitation (after 6 weeks-time 1), on the above parameters. A follow up will be included (time 2, 8 weeks after the end of the treatment) to address long-term effects on neurologic and mood measurements as well as peripheral marker levels.","Clinical manifestations of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) indicate the involvement of motor, sensory, visual systems, cognition and emotion, as well as peripheral autonomic system (PAS). Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) are immunomodulatory drugs designed to dampen the immune reaction occurring in MS. Indeed, MS pathogenesis is supposed to rely on the break of immunological tolerance against myelin epitopes, which trigger an inflammatory cascade that leads to chronic inflammation, axonal loss and neurodegeneration. T cell population in MS presents several metabolic dysfunctions, such as glycolysis alterations that can be attenuated by DMTs. Studies of synaptic transmission conducted on both MS patients, via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and EAE mice, via electrophysiological recordings of single neurons, showed an early synaptopathy characterized by an impairment of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmissions. Such synaptopathy is independent of demyelination and caused by inflammation. Importantly, TMS cortical excitability measures positively correlate with disability in MS patients. Moreover, chimeric experiments obtained incubating MS T cells and murine brain slices, clearly indicate that T cells drive synaptic damage during MS, suggesting that interfering with T cell-neuron crosstalk could be a possible therapeutic target.

Due to the complexity and the heterogeneity of the disease course and the clinical symptoms, the search for the appropriate personalized treatment and the disease management remains a challenging issue. It is increasingly recognized that a multi-disciplinary approach in MS treatment, including non-pharmacological interventions is required to treat MS. Active-rehabilitation or exercise has been proven effective in the improvement of cardiovascular functions, aerobic capacity, muscular strength and ambulatory performance, while some data indicate that other outcomes, like balance and depression can be positively influenced by exercise. Symptoms of sympathovagal imbalance, like altered heart rate variability (HRV), previously shown to depend on inflammatory bulk in MS, may be positively modulated by exercise, which is known to regulate both the peripheral nervous system and the immune system. However, the mechanisms involved in exercise-beneficial effects as well as the impact of exercise on MS pathophysiological hallmarks, especially those regarding the immune-synaptic axis, are still poorly elucidated.

This longitudinal, interventional, non-pharmacological study is designed to enrol 44 MS patients and 30 healthy controls matched by gender and age to the MS group. The MS patient group will undergo a conventional 6-week rehabilitation program. Physical therapy will be performed for 6 days/week for 6 weeks and will consist of 3 hours of treatment per day. The rehabilitation program will be planned by a physician specialized in physical and rehabilitation medicine and will consist of both passive and active therapeutic exercises specifically aimed at restoring or maintaining muscular flexibility, range of motion, balance, coordination of movements, postural passages and transfers, and ambulation. According to the patient's disability status, different therapeutic exercises will be performed by qualified physiotherapists. Intensity of exercise will be tailored to the level of patient's disability. Furthermore, advanced robotic therapy such as Lokomat® exoskeleton (Hocoma AG, Volketswil, Switzerland), Biodex® Stability System (BSS, Biodex, Inc, Shirley, NY), G-EO System™ (Reha Technology AG, Olten, Svizzera) and Indego® Therapy (Parker USA), will be used to standardize rehabilitation treatment and obtain more objective indices of motor function and will be applied according to clinical indications. Three time-points (t) of evaluations are included in the study: t0 (before starting the rehabilitation period), t1 (soon after rehabilitation) and t2 (follow-up, after 8 weeks by the end of rehabilitation). Therapeutic efficacy will be evaluated at the end of the exercise program (t1) by repeating evaluations performed at t0, which include neurological and psychological assessments, together with measures of brain synaptic activity and vagal function and immune function. At t2, analysis will be limited to neurological and psychological assessments and immune function. Thus, blood samples will be collected at t0, t1 and t2 to study changes in immune function that might correlate with clinical parameters described as primary and secondary outcomes at the different time-points.

Statistical analysis will be performed by IBM SPSS Statistics 15.0. Data will be tested for normality distribution through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences between pre- and post-values will be analyzed using parametric Student's t-test for matched pairs, or if necessary, nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched pairs. Changes in categorical variables will be assessed by McNemar test. Correlation analysis will be performed by calculating Pearson or Spearman coefficients as appropriate. Changes in categorical variables will be evaluated by the test McNemar. Data will be presented as the mean (standard deviation, sd) or median (25th- 75th percentile). The significance level is established at p\<0.05.

Sample size calculation was performed according to the following criteria. Assuming that in MS patients the cytokine values in particular the TNF level after exercise therapy decrease in a manner similar to that showed in the study by Hedegaard et al (2008). Based on these results, calculating an average difference between pre and post exercise values of TNF equal to 1365.1 pg / ml (sd = 2570), d = 0.53, in order to appreciate a moderate effect with a statistical capacity of 95% and assuming a two-tailed a = 0.05 and applying a Wilcoxon rank test for paired values, the investigators estimate a total number of patients equal to 40. Analysis was performed with the G \* POWER v3.1.9.2 program. Considering possible drop-outs, the investigators estimate to increase the number of patients recruited by one percentage equal to 10%, meaning 4 subjects. Moreover, using Power Analysis d=0.61, it has been calculated that the number of healthy volunteer subjects needed to be recruited for the study of the immunophenotype and secretoma will be 30 subjects per experimental group, in order to be able to refuse the null hypothesis that the two groups are equal with a test power of 95% and appreciate a difference of 1600.9 pg / ml between the means of the experimental groups (healthy control vs MS) (standard deviation equal to 2599), d = 0.61.

(b) Traditional physical therapy programme:

All patients will receive a traditional physical therapy programme consisting of 45 minutes per session of a supervised and individualized exercise programme for three sessions per week for eight weeks which will include:

1. Stretching exercises for calf and hamstring muscles by using the hold relax technique:

   - To achieve this, the limb will be placed at its limit of range and an isometric contraction will be sustained (for 5 to 10 seconds), followed by a voluntary relaxation of the tightened muscles. The limb will then be passively moved into the new range and sustained the stretch for 30 seconds for 3 repetitions at each time.
2. Strengthening exercises for hip, knee, ankle, and foot muscles:

   * One repetition maximum test (1RM): The patients will be tested to determine the amount of weight or load that will be used during the first week (of the 8 weeks program) as baseline loads.
   * To improve strength, free weights will be used for all exercises. During the first week, 50 to 60% of their individual 1RM will be set as the starting weight. Then, from the second week to the sixth, the weight will be increased to 70%-75% of their individual 1RM. The training amplitude will be then raised to 80%-85% of their individual 1RM that will be continued through weeks 7 and 8, holding 5 seconds at the end of the range. (Number of repetitions: 3 sets,10 repetitions in each).
3. Deep friction massage for scar management:

Measuring equipment:

a)Lafayette hand-held dynamometer (HHD): Hand-held dynamometer (HHD) is a convenient, reliable and valid instrument for muscle strength assessment.

in this study, Lafayette manual muscle testing (model 01163 USA) will be used for objectively quantifying the maximum isometric muscle strength of knee extensors and knee flexors.

knee extensors and flexors will be assessed while participants will be in a sitting position, hips and knees 90° flexed. The dynamometer will be positioned above the ankle joint, on the anterior aspect of the shank for assessing knee extensors, or on the posterior aspect of the shank for measuring knee flexors (b) Berg balance scale (BBS): Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is one of the most widely used tools for balance assessment. this scale has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure of balance.

The BBS consists of 14 items and has a maximum possible score of 56 points. It uses an ordinal scoring system in which each detail is rated, 0 being the lowest and 4 being the highest level of function.

(c) Arabic version of lower extremity functional scale (LEFS): The Arabic version of lower extremity functional scale will be used to assess lower limb functions. LEFS is an excellent patient-reported outcome measure that can be used in clinical practice and for research purposes to assess the level of activity limitation. The validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the LEFS have been established for musculoskeletal disorders. LEFS has 20 items each scored on 0-4 Likert scale and the overall score on the scale is produced by summing scores on all items. LEFS scores range from 0 to 80 with higher score indicating better functional ability.",COMPLETED,,2023-07-01,2024-03-01,2024-03-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,76,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Pilates exercises"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Pilates exercises:\n\nThe subjects will receive Pilates training (3 sessions/week) for 8 weeks.

OTHER,NCT00405379,Trabecular Metal Mesh Tibial Monoblock RSA,"A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Using Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis of Trabecular Metal Mesh Tibial Monoblock Knee Arthroplasty Component ""TMM"".",Trabecular Metal(TM) is a relatively new technology and its use in knee replacement is quite different from the more conventional total knee replacement (arthroplastie). The aim of incorporating TMM into the material used for the knee replacement (tibial prostheses) is to improve initial fixation of the prosthesis at the time of implantation (surgery) and to improve long term prosthesis survival by encouraging and improving bone ingrowth.,"Hip and knee replacement arthroplasty are profoundly successful operative interventions, however, some joint replacements do fail and the life expectancy of a hip or knee arthroplasty is finite (Malchau et al. 1993, Knutson et al. 1994, Herberts et al. 1997, Garellick et al. 1998). This fact has largely been responsible for the continued development of new devices and techniques for joint arthroplasty surgery. Unfortunately, the introduction of new technologies and devices is not a benign process, and even subtle changes to existing implants can have a disastrous effect on patient outcome (Sudmann et al. 1983, Herberts P. 1986, Ohlin et al. 1989, Wedderkopp et al. 1997, Howie et al. 1998, Nilsson et al. 1998).

The fact that new technologies and devices can lead to poor results has led some authors to advocate a phased introduction of new technologies (Gross 1988, Gross 1993, Malchau 1999). A key component of the phased introduction approach advocates the use of roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) early in the testing process (Malchau 1999).

RSA is a highly accurate radiographic technique developed in Lund, Sweden and has for some time been the gold standard in Europe for assessing the stability of implants within bone (Selvik 1990, Ryd 1992, Catani et al. 1998, Alfaro-Adrian et al. 1999). It is at least ten times more accurate than conventional radiography (Ryd et al. 1986). RSA involves the insertion of small tantalum markers (0.8mm) into the bone and prosthesis at the time of surgery (Ryd 1986, Ryd et al. 1986, Ryd et al. 1989, Selvik 1990, Ryd 1992). By using a calibrated cage with additional markers and simultaneous bi-planar x-rays, micromotion at the prosthesis-bone interface can be very precisely determined (Selvik et al. 1983). Two types of micromotion can be investigated: migration, i.e. gradual motion over time, and inducible displacement, i.e. instant motion in response to external forces (Ryd et al. 1986). The pattern of micromotion exhibited by various prostheses and fixation techniques within the first post-operative year has been shown to be predictive of the long-term fixation of the component to bone, especially when considering the tibial prosthesis-bone interface (Ryd 1986, Ryd et al. 1986, Ryd 1992, Ryd et al. 1995). The value of this precise radiographic technique is that new technologies and techniques can be introduced in vivo while limiting their exposure to as few patients as possible. RSA is a proven, safe and invaluable method for assessing methods of tibial component fixation as well as different design concepts (Ryd et al. 1987, Nilsson et al. 1991, Ryd et al. 1992, Ryd et al. 1993, Hilding et al. 1995, Onsten et al. 1998, Nilsson et al. 1999).

Until recently, RSA technology has been cumbersome and expensive. However, significant advances have made the system more applicable due to the fact that digitized films are being used, and computer programs have been written and can run on small personal computers that will allow for automatic capture and interpretation of x-ray markers and implants (Vrooman et al. 1998).

Trabecular Metal(TM) is a relatively new technology and its use in tibial knee arthroplasty components represents a significant departure from conventional total knee arthroplasties. TM has a high co-efficient of friction and high affinity for bone ingrowth (Bobyn et al. 1999a, Bobyn et al. 1999b, Hacking et al. 2000), subsequently, the aims of incorporating TMM into tibial prostheses is to improve initial fixation of the tibial prosthesis at the time of implantation and to improve long term prosthesis survival by facilitating bone ingrowth. Such advantages remain, however, theoretical, and have yet to be demonstrated in vivo for total knee arthroplasty. With conventional study techniques, a definitive answer to the effect of the prosthetic design on fixation of the tibial component would require a large number of patients and approximately 10 years of follow-up (Ryd 1992, Ryd et al. 1995). RSA provides a means of accurately assessing the tibial component fixation, both immediate and long term, on a relatively small number of patients within two years of the onset of the study. It is critical at this stage to determine the long-term effect of this design concept on component fixation so that any deleterious effects can be addressed and any advantageous effects can be disseminated to the orthopaedic community.",COMPLETED,,2002-07,2007-02,2006-08,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,67,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Trabecular Metal Mesh Tibial Monoblock Knee Arthroplasty"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""new porous metal tibial component with potential to result in improved bone in-growth and implant integration with proximal tibia"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE,trabecular metal mesh tibial monoblock knee arthroplasty,1

Consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) has dramatically increased worldwide and is more prevalent in women than men. Similarly, obesity rates have continued to rise, most notably in minorities. Since NNS consumption has been linked to obesity, we propose studying NNS effects specifically in minority women.

NNS are frequently consumed in combination with prescription medications. This necessitates the study of possible NNS-drug interactions. The hypothesis that NNS may affect drug absorption and metabolism is based on a rodent study. In 2008, Abou-Donia et al reported that sucralose increased the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a membrane transporter involved in absorption and distribution of a wide range of pharmacologic compounds, and CYP3A, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme important to the first-pass metabolism of many drugs.

So far, NNS effects in clinical studies were mostly observed after acute (one time) or short term exposure. For example, we and others found increased incretin and insulin concentrations in response to sucralose alone or in combination with acesulfame-potassium prior to a glucose load. The effects were most pronounced in obese African American women. We also found upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in subcutaneous fat biopsies of obese individuals who reported consumption of NNS compared to non-consumers. Whether these hormonal and tissue responses persist after prolonged exposure needs to be investigated. NNS have also been shown to influence the microbial composition of the oral cavity and the gut. However, most data were generated in mice and do not exist in humans.

Aims:

Primary Aim: To determine the effects of sucralose (4 mg/kg/day) administered to overweight and obese minority women for 28 days on drug metabolism using digoxin and midazolam as probes for P-glycoprotein and CYP3A, respectively.

Secondary Aims: To investigate the effects of sucralose on

1. glucose metabolism and incretin secretion
2. lipid metabolism
3. intestinal microflora

Methods:

The study consists of 3 periods. In the first period (run-in, 7 days), participants will be instructed to avoid all NNS (including NNS in cosmetics or health care products). During the second and third periods (14 days each), participants will be randomized to consume either sucralose containing capsules (4 mg/kg/day) or placebo. At the end of each period, the following measurements will be obtained during an overnight hospitalization:

1. Serial measurements of plasma concentrations of midazolam and digoxin for 24 hours following a single oral dose of each drug
2. Frequently sampled 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to measure glucose, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, and other gut hormones.

At the end of P1 (run-in, no intervention) and after P3 (sucralose exposure x 4 weeks), subcutaneous fat biopsies will be performed.

OTHER,NCT05827679,Creation and Validation of a Clinical Evaluation Scale for Abdominal Condition of the Premature (ECAP),Creation and Validation of a Clinical Evaluation Scale for Abdominal Condition of the Premature,"Every year in France, 60,000 children are born prematurely (before 37 weeks of amenorrhea), and present an immaturity of their various systems, in particular the digestive system. This can result in feeding intolerance, which is expressed by abdominal distension, regurgitation or vomiting, irregular transit and abdominal discomfort. This feeding intolerance influences the length of hospitalization and can lead to necrotising enterocolitis, a major complication.

In the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Clermont-Ferrand hospital center, abdominal massages have been performed by physiotherapists for several years in order to improve the condition of the digestive system. However, the indication for abdominal massage is very dependent on the caregivers in charge of the newborn and the evaluation of the abdominal condition remains subjective with a great variability between examiners. Thus, some newborns will receive massage multiple times a day while others will not.

Developmental care is essential for these premature infants, especially to avoid over-stimulation. It is important not to add care, such as massage, if it is not needed. It is therefore essential to properly assess the digestive status of premature babies in order to determine whether they have feeding intolerance and whether they require treatment with abdominal massage.

To date, the investigators have not found measurable criteria or existing scales that can describe the digestive status of newborns. The main objective of the study is therefore to create and validate a clinical assessment scale for the abdominal status of preterm infants.","This is an observational study with longitudinal follow-up regarding the validation of a scale that the investigators have created.

This pilot triol has the primary goal of demonstrating the safety of transferring viruses and proteins from healthy term infants to preterm infants born between gestational age (GA) 26 + 0 and 30+6. The long-term goal is to develop a safe and effective treatment to prevent the severe gut disease called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

NEC is a common disease in neonatal intensive care units affecting 5-10% of all admitted patients. 15-30% of the affected children die from the disease, and many of the survivors suffer from the effects of extensive gut surgery.

While the disease is caused by many different factors, recent research has shown the gut microbiome to be a central factor in the development of NEC. Furthermore, in the recent years special viruses called bacteriophages have shown potential in the treatment of various diseases.

By collecting feces from healthy, term infants and filtering it thoroughly, the investigators can provide a treatment that contains practically only viruses, proteins and nutrients. It is our belief that giving the preterm infants a mix of viruses including bacteriophages will prevent NEC.

To do this, the investigators will go through 3 stages:

1. Recruiting and following healthy donor infants to study the microbiota and use feces from them to donate in stage 2 and 3
2. Examining the safety of the treatment as well as how it works in preterm piglets
3. Testing the treatment in preterm infants. 10 preterm infants will receive the treatment and 10 preterm infants will receive placebo. The investigators expect to see no serious side effects to the treatment. The investigators hope, but do not expect to be able to see a beneficial effect of the treatment.

If this pilot trial shows promising results, it will be followed be a larger clinical trial.","PrePhage - Fecal bacteriophage transfer for enhanced gastrointestinal tract maturation in preterm infants

This pilot trial aims to investigate if fecal filtrate transfers (FFT) to preterm infants is safe and tolerable. To investigate this, the investigators will recruit 20 donor infants and their mothers from time of delivery, and both will be subjected to a novel screening program including blood, urine, breastmilk, fecal screening and standard clinical investigation. Donor fecal samples will be collected from time of birth and with varying intervals for consecutive 3 years for 3 purposes: 1) to conduct safety studies in preterm piglets before transfer to preterm recipient infants, 2) to conduct FFT to preterm infants, and 3) to map normal microbiota development in healthy infants. The feces used for donation will be collected between 2-4 weeks after birth. After 1 year, donated feces will be released for FFT to preterm, but only if the donor infant at this time has been healthy and normally developed. Donors are followed up for consecutive 3 years after birth. Maternal fecal samples will be compared to infant samples, to investigate maternal to infant transfer of microbiota, as well as changes in infant microbiota in response to environment.

20 preterm infants with gestational age between 26 +0 - 30+6 weeks + days, are block randomized to either FFT or saline placebo within 24 hours after birth and the following 3 days, in total 4 donations. The recipients are clinically and biochemically closely monitored by attending staff and the group of investigators according to best clinical practice and predefined clinical observation. The recipients are followed up for consecutive 3 years to evaluate potential late side-effects and to monitor change in fecal microbiome after transplant or placebo.

The primary endpoint is to assess safety of FFT to preterm infants with expected no increase in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis and death in the intervention group. The secondary endpoint is to assess if, FFT treatment will reduce incidence of feeding tolerance and improve healthy gut development in recipient preterm infants. The investigators expect to find FFT safe and with fewer cases of NEC and sepsis. The investigators do not expect to prove the effect of the intervention in this study. However, the investigators aim to follow up with a double-blinded multicenter randomized control trial - powered to document our hypothesis - that when colonizing with a healthy microbiome, it is possible decrease incidence of NEC in premature infants.",RECRUITING,,2023-11-07,2025-12-31,2025-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,EARLY_PHASE1,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,20,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Fecal Filtrate Transfer"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Treatment with donated fecal samples filtered to contain practically no bacteria and mainly viruses, including bacteriophages"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Placebo"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Saline solution"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER;OTHER,fecal filtrate transfer;placebo,0

OTHER,NCT06918379,Eye-tracking Working Memory Training in Children and Youth With Severe Cerebral Palsy,Eye-tracking Working Memory Training in School-aged Children and Youth With Severe Cerebral Palsy,"People with severe cerebral palsy (CP) who are nonverbal and unable to control conventional computer interfaces due to the severe limitations in hand control benefit from eye-tracking technology as access method to Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices and to computers for education and leisure. Research has put forward the large demands that the use of AAC puts on working memory (WM), defined as our ability to temporarily store information that is no longer perceptually present, allowing us to manipulate it for meaningful goal-directed behaviour.

People with CP show significant WM deficits, which affect learning capacities and academic achievement, including impaired language and reading comprehension, and arithmetic difficulties. Cogmed WM training (CWMT) is a computerized software with a great potential to boost WM capacity and overall cognitive functioning. Its effectiveness is influenced by the theory of neuroplasticity due to repeated mental tasks.

To date, no prior study investigated the effectiveness of CWMT in children and youth with severe CP who rely on eye-tracking technology for daily-life functioning. This is the first trial that aims to explore the impact of a 5-week CWMT on WM capacity and its near-transfer effect (trained and untrained WM tasks), far-transfer effect (other cognitive abilities, quality of eye movements and behaviour) and retention 3-months post intervention.","Working memory (WM) is one of the core executive functions (EF) which encompass higher-order cognitive abilities, critical for optimal daily-life functioning. WM is defined as our ability to temporarily store information that is no longer perceptually present, allowing us to manipulate it for meaningful goal-directed behaviors, such as decision-making, problem-solving and reasoning. WM includes verbal WM and (nonverbal) visuospatial WM, two main components defined by content. Verbal WM is responsible for temporarily storing verbal information such as letters, words, numbers or nameable objects, and is a strong predictor of language development and reading comprehension. Visuo-spatial WM is a fundamental component of the eye movement system, visual perceptual functioning and it is a strong predictor of arithmetic performance. WM is related to active long-term memory aiding the retrieval of stored information from past experiences to successfully execute the task at present. WM is practically involved in most (if not all) daily-life activities, from simple tasks like remembering a phone number or following instructions, to highly complex tasks associated with learning, academic achievements in literacy, numeracy and science, or language comprehension.

One of the central limitations of human cognition is the restricted WM capacity, i.e., the amount and duration of information that can be stored and manipulated at once. Low WM capacity affects approximately 15% of all children, from which over 80% are at very high risk of educational underachievement. In terms of its neural basis, prior work consistently put forward an important role of fronto-parietal networks in WM performance with some variation depending on stimulus type. In typically developing (TD) people, WM continues developing throughout childhood and peaks in adolescence along with a number of structural maturational processes in the brain. Significant WM deficits have been described in an array of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of severe physical disability in childhood with a prevalence of 1.6-3.4 per 1000 livebirths. It comprises a group of developmental impairments of movement and posture attributed to nonprogressive lesions in the developing fetal or infant brain. CP is categorized into spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic and mixed forms, and functioning of individuals ranges from mild to severe levels of limitations. In CP, 41% of all people are not able to walk independently, 23% are unable to handle objects using their hands, and 32% are nonverbal. The motor impairments are frequently accompanied by impairments of cognition and behaviour. EF in CP are underreported to date, particularly in the non-ambulant and non-verbal cases of CP where these impairments tend to be overlooked due to challenges in finding appropriate assessment tools that do not rely on motor and verbal skills. Namely, only 36.8% of children with severe motor impairments in CP have their cognitive functioning assessed, compared to 96.5% of children with mild CP. Both verbal and visuospatial WM deficits seem to be present in all forms of CP and more so as severity of functional limitations increases. In CP, WM deficits are associated to impaired reading comprehension and arithmetic difficulties. Learning difficulties are present in around 40% and visual-perceptual impairments in 40-50% of all people with CP.

In addition to central neural alterations, children with CP also show altered functioning of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), as evidenced by inherent reduced heart rate variability (HRV). In TD population, higher performance of WM (and EFs in general) is strongly associated with increased HRV, an established marker of parasympathetic ANS drive (facilitating 'rest and digest'). This suggests that HRV also forms an important marker indexing effective cognitive function. In TD, increased HRV is accompanied by increased resting-state functional brain connectivity. Investigations into the relative contribution of HRV differences in CP and their relation to EF deficiencies and to core functional connectivity networks previously identified as related to WM have not been addressed in any prior study.

People with CP with severe motor impairments benefit from eye-tracking technology as an access method to assistive and alternative communication devices (AAC) and to computers for education and leisure. Eye movements are tracked by an infrared sensor and translated to cursor movements on the screen by which children can navigate and select icons of interest. Nonverbal children with CP have significantly impaired language comprehension, especially prominent in spastic CP. Eye-tracking technology leads to increased communication outcomes, and it has a positive impact on quality of life through increased activity levels, participation levels, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. With its undeniable benefits in mind, the use of AAC puts large demands on WM. For example, to express wants and needs, these children need to remember the symbol of interest, all the while navigating through an array of symbols not all of which are simultaneously present, remembering the most efficient path, inhibiting possible distractions and finally locating and selecting the target symbol. The use of AAC systems can be a real challenge for children with low WM capacity, likely leading to technology discontinuance, and loss of opportunities and benefits. People with CP also show lower quality of eye movements compared to TD people, however, eye movement accuracy can be improved through intensive eye-tracking training. In addition, eye-tracking methods have been previously used to successfully index WM, a method which has not yet been investigated in people with CP, but may hold important clinical implications.

Computerized WM training emerged as a novel, non-invasive treatment option with great potential to boost WM capacity and overall cognitive functioning. EF share capacity constraints and have overlapping neural systems, which explains the generalized effect of WM training to other cognitive functions. A recent systematic review synthesized the existing evidence about cognitive interventions in CP, highlighting, among others, the low quality of existing evidence in WM training programs and the need for future, more robust studies in CP. Previous research in cognitive interventions (in general) spans from activity interventions to boost cognitive abilities (i.e. climbing, dancing, hippotherapy) to specific training programs, such as Mi-Yoga mindfulness-based movement program, Move-It-to-improve-it (Mitii), and Cogmed WM Training (CWMT). Due to the severe motor impairments, the goal group of severe CP (GMFCS levels IV-V) are not able to perform the activity interventions of climbing, dancing, hippotherapy. Furthermore, they are not able to perform the movement-based programs, such as the Mi-Yoga and Mitii, leaving the CWMT program as the most feasible training program for children and youth with severe CP who can access their computers using eye-tracking devices. Other computerized intervention training programs include SMART (in the developing stages, not specific to WM training thereby not useful to meet the project's goals), and NeuronUp (https://www.neuronup.com/; not specific to WM training but rather of executive functions in general), for which there is currently only a published study protocol of an RCT in mild CP, however, the authors have not yet published any results so there is no evidence to support its use to boost cognitive abilities in general, and of WM in specific.

CWMT is currently the most used training software with the most empirical evidence available on its effectiveness in different populations. The software itself relies on adaptive training using algorithms, that is, the difficulty of the WM tasks is constantly kept at the highest to challenge WM capacity but still fit to the abilities of each user. WM Training is strongly influenced by the theory of neuroplasticity which relies on repeated and tailored training, hence the adaptive algorithm. Neuroplasticity changes have been reported after in different populations as well as in premature children (including few participants with CP). In spite of extensive research using CWMT, the general conclusion is that the increased WM capacity as a result of the training has repeatedly shown near-transfer effects but inconclusive far-transfer and retention effects, the latter largely dependent on age, population, training type and duration. CWMT is the best WM training software to use in this project for various reasons: (1) it is designed specifically to boost WM capacity, which is not the case for the other computerized training programs that aim to improve executive functions in general (including cognitive flexibility, attention etc.); this is a critical point to consider as the main goal of this project is to assess any changes primarily in WM capacity, and then if any skills are transferred to the other executive functions; (2) CWMT program has substantially more evidence for its positive impact on WM capacity explored in high quality studies, (3) training is structured with 25 sessions in total, and tasks within each session are adapted to the participant's abilities, offering a targeted and customized training experience which is crucial given the heterogeneity that characterizes CP as a diagnosis; (4) CWMT sessions can be performed using eye-tracking devices, which is critical for the goal group of children and youth with severe CP.

The effectiveness of WM Training in CP remains largely unexplored. To the researchers knowledge, the only study that used CWMT (as a training program with the most empirical evidence to date to improve WM capacity) in children with spastic CP reported significant improvements post-training in both near-transfer and far-transfer skills, including in visuo-spatial skills, inhibition and phonological processing. Two studies using the CWMT in extremely-low and very-low birth-weight children (each study included two participants with CP) also reported both near- and far-transfer effects, retained at 6-months follow-up. Although with promising results, these studies excluded children with CP with severe motor impairments, leaving a gap in knowledge of importance to be explored.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2024-11-04,2025-04-30,2024-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,5,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Cogmed Working Memory Training (CWMT)"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""This is an intensive, eye-tracking working memory (WM) training in school-aged children and young adults with severe cerebral palsy.

Patients most commonly have small AVMs called telangiectases on the tongue, face, hands, mouth, and throat and the mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. Recurrent nosebleeds are a hallmark of the disease. Large AVMs can also occur in various organs, causing sudden and life-threatening complications.

The study will examine how patients think and feel about their condition and what actions they take to screen for internal symptoms of the disease.

Men and women 18 years of age and older who have HHT may be eligible for this study. Participants fill out a 30-minute questionnaire, available in print or online, that includes questions about the participant s

* actions taken to screen for internal symptoms of HHT
* experience with HHT
* current health status, family history and demographic information","The proposed study aims to understand the factors that influence screening behaviors of adults with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is a chronic condition, but with early diagnosis followed by adherence to recommended screening guidelines, the major complications of this disorder can be avoided and disability or even death can be prevented. Yet, it has come to the attention of healthcare professionals that the recommended screening is not commonly followed by individuals with HHT, even when the risk of serious complications is known. Nonadherence to screening recommendations is not unique to HHT. It is rather common across chronic conditions, and genetic diseases, such as HHT, are no exception. However, HHT may have an added barrier to screening and treatment adherence in that it is a rare and underdiagnosed condition. Inadequate knowledge of healthcare providers may be a serious barrier to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The Health Belief Model (HBM) can be used to frame this study of HHT screening. The HBM posits that preventive health behaviors will be acted upon if individuals regard themselves as susceptible to the threat, they believe the consequences to be severe, and the perceived benefits outweigh the perceived barriers. In addition to the HBM constructs, this study will also consider the role of illness representations which provide a more personal view of the lived experience of individuals with HHT. A cosss-sectional design will be used to investigate the relationships among the domains of illness representations, HBM constructs (perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, response efficacy, cues to action), and HHT-specific screening guidelines. Participants will be recruited from the HHT Foundation International, Inc., an outline HHT Awareness social group, and HHT Clinics. Participants will be asked to complete either a web-based or a paper survey.

Participants: Around 150 Down Syndrome people from Cordoba, Malaga y Granada who belong to The Down Syndrome association and 150 parents, family, tutors, teachers etc.

Consent process: Before designing the survey, consent was requested from the management team Down of Córdoba, Malaga and Gradana associations, as well as family members, parents, tutors, teachers, etc.

Standard Operating Procedures: First, RC (author) gathered as much information as possible about the subject under study and selected the most important topics related to the research focus. After that, the questionnaire was designed modifying the KidsLife-Down Scale. The questionnaire will be divided into three parts.

An introduction to the questionnaire describes the instructions, structure, the reasons for the study and confidentiality in accordance with the Spanish Organic Law 3/2018 on the Protection.

The first part of the questionnaire will assess self-perception from people with Down about their social skills. The second will evaluate the opinion of this issue from other people who know them well (at least for six months) and who have the opportunity to observe the person evaluated for extended periods of time (parents, family, tutors, teachers etc.). Finally, for the third part, it will be used the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for the purpose of collecting information about the types of physical activity do in their daily routines. The questions will be referred to the time they have been physically active in the last 7 days.

Second, the questionnaire was sent to the Down Syndrome Association of Córdoba (DSAC) so that they reviewed the possible mistakes made when defining the questions and validate it. After that, Down Malaga and Down Granada Association found the questionnaire understandable and acceptable.

Third, they gave the corresponding feedback that served to formulate the questions in the appropriate way to avoid confusion in the surveyed.

The questionnaire will be sent by e-mail to the Cordoba Association and a paper version will available for participants. From Córdoba, it will be spread to Málaga and Granada Associations in order it will be distributed among associates.

Analysis of results: Estimated outcomes will be percentages of agreement with each answer. Data from all surveys will be analyzed. The statistical study will be carried out with the SPSS 24.0 program. The mean value and standard deviation (± SD) of each item will be calculated on a numerical scale. Statistical analysis will be performed with parametric tests, t-Student for related samples. The level of statistical significance will be calculated.

Two of the authors (RC and JC) will analyse de data, and results will be discussed among the work team.

Conducting a pilot test or pre-test before applying the survey will help to detect possible failures and optimize the results of our survey. Despite its importance, should not consider the pilot study as a substitute for a careful wording of the questionnaire.

OTHER,NCT04957979,Minnesota Care Coordination Effectiveness Study,Comparing Two Approaches to Care Coordination for High-Cost/High-Need Patients in Primary Care,"Medical care has improved greatly over the past 50 years. Treatments for most medical conditions can help us lead longer and healthier lives, but there are still problems. Many patients with two or more conditions see many different doctors and sometimes take more medications than needed. These patients can feel lost and confused. In addition, non-medical issues involving housing, food, transportation, employment, income, support from others, and language barriers can have a large impact on our health.

In Minnesota, many primary care clinics are using a method called care coordination to improve the health of patients who have a number of chronic diseases (some examples of chronic diseases include diabetes, heart disease, asthma and depression). With care coordination, a nurse in the clinic helps the various doctors, clinics, and specialists to work together, in the interest of the patient. In some clinics, a social worker also helps with care coordination. These social workers help with issues like housing, transportation, or employment. Care coordination can help reduce patient confusion. It also can improve health and lower patient burdens and costs of getting medical care.

To help find out what types of care coordination are most successful, we are proposing a study. Our plan is to track the health of patients receiving care coordination and compare two types:

A. Care coordination done by a nurse or other clinic staff B. Care coordination where a licensed social worker also assists the patient

In this study, we will measure many things, including:

1. Control of chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and depression
2. Hospitalizations
3. Emergency department visits
4. Use of medications and diagnostic tests
5. Use of specialty care
6. General health status
7. Patient satisfaction and access to care
8. Use of shared decision-making (where the doctor and the patient make treatment decisions together)
9. Patient burden (how much time and effort the patient spends trying to get healthy)
10. Patients' out-of-pocket medical costs

This project will be important to patients because it could reduce confusion and fragmented care while improving all the items above. Those improvements will be more likely because this project takes advantage of engagement with patients and others. We have four patient partners who will help conduct the study and interpret and broadly share the results. The project was developed with the input from patients, clinic leaders, people from state government, and experts on health and quality care.

By measuring a wide variety of outcomes for the adults receiving coordination services in these clinics, we hope to identify the specific actionable information that will allow these and other clinics to improve their services for these patients with complex needs.

Throughout the project, we will communicate our findings to clinics and health systems.

Untreated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to be a key risk factor for the transition from acute pain to chronic pain. However, few published studies have addressed the issue of preventing the transition from acute to chronic pain via PTSD reduction. This project will aim to test whether trauma-related PTSD symptoms can be reduced using either Stellate Ganglion Block (SGB) treatment or Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), and whether reducing PTSD symptoms can prevent the transition from non-injury based acute pain to chronic pain.","Untreated PTSD appears to be a key risk factor for the transition from acute pain to chronic pain. Thus, reducing PTSD symptoms during an acute pain episode may potentially decrease the likelihood of transitioning to chronic pain. CPT is an evidence-based trauma-focused cognitive behavioral treatment that is hypothesized to reduce PTSD symptoms via reducing negative trauma-related cognitions about oneself, others, and the world. SGB treatment is an injection of a local anesthetic into the stellate ganglion, which is a bundle of nerves located at the base of the neck that is part of the sympathetic nervous system.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well genistein works in treating patients with prostate cancer.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine whether genistein treatment will decrease the number of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in the peripheral blood as measured by qRT-PCR for PSA performed on RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the natural history of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in a cohort of subjects prior to and post radical prostatectomy.

II. Compare the measurement of PSA between three separate methods: in CPCs by qRT-PCR, in serum by the standard clinical chemistry assay (i.e., ELISA), and in plasma and serum by the nano-PSA assay.

III. Measure the effect of genistein on gene and protein expression in prostate tissue by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, for the following genes and their respective protein products: HSP27, MMP-2, ALK-2, BASP1, and HCF2.

OUTLINE:

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive oral genistein once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.

ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.

The decline in muscle mass is estimated to be 0.2-0.5% per year from 60 years old onwards in healthy subjects with the decline worsened by chronic illness, poor appetite and diet, and reduced physical activity in the elderly. Increased morbidity is demonstrable with as little as a 5% loss of muscle mass - therefore, treatments that can prevent or slow the progression of muscle loss with aging are much desired.

A major cause for loss of muscle mass in advanced age appears to be an impaired ability to stimulate the synthesis of muscle protein in response to increased levels of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and insulin as occurs after eating because of low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance in muscle of old persons. We propose that long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oil) slow the loss of muscle mass because fish oil has anti-inflammatory properties and increases the sensitivity of muscle protein synthesis to insulin and amino acids.

Data will be included from previous cohort studies from four countries: United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Denmark, and France.","This is a retrospective non-interventional cohort study of women with sPPH who were treated with NovoSeven® or other standard of care. The analyses will be done utilising data that were collected for other purposes in four countries. The data include four previously established cohorts from the UK, France, Denmark and The Netherlands. In short, these population-based studies collected data, using enhanced systems, from the medical records of the women who met the case definition for each of the respective studies. Data are available from approximately 1260 (Netherlands, 39 exposed to NovoSeven®), 1655 (France, 18 exposed to NovoSeven®), 245 (DK, 28 exposed to NovoSeven®) and 162 (UK, 13 exposed to NovoSeven®) patients with persistent PPH.

Information regarding patient characteristics, concomitant treatment and outcomes in PPH women treated with NovoSeven® is limited in many countries. The current study will therefore include a description of women with PPH treated with NovoSeven®, or standard of care in each of the four cohorts. This will also include an assessment of the comparability of the cohorts and the overall rate of clinical outcomes in the study population. To aid in this assessment propensity scores will be calculated and used to match the women with an event of sPPH treated with NovoSeven® and those that are not.

The UK and Danish datasets were national and the datasets from Netherlands, and France were from multiple regions. The TeMpOH-1 study in the Netherlands collected data from 75% of national births. The EPIMOMS study in France collected data from six regions: Alsace, Lorraine, Auvergne, Rhone-Alpes, Ile-de-France and Basse-Normandie and these regions represented 18% of national births.

Data come from the below described cohorts.

Denmark: The Danish data were identified and collected using the Danish Medical Birth Registry (DMBR) and the Danish Trans-fusion Database (DTD). During the period 2001-2009, women who had a birth identified in the DMBR and had transfused 10 or more units of red blood cells (RBC) within 24 hours identified from DTD were included in study. The DMBR collects information on all births in Denmark and this includes clinical and demographic data from each birth. The DTD is a national database and contains information of the quantity and type of blood products transfused and the time of each transfusion. Additional data were extracted from the patient charts (Study II in the PhD thesis(PubMed ID 29510809)).

France: This study included data from the EPIMOMS study (PubMed ID 33423750). This is a population-based study that prospectively identified cases of severe maternal morbidity from 6 regions in France: Alsace, Lorraine, Auvergne, Rhone-Alpes, Ile-de-France and Normandy. Cases were identified for a year between 2012-2013 from 113 intensive care units and 118 maternity units. Selected maternal morbidities were identified by a local reporter in each hospital. Data concerning demographics, previous medical history, current pregnancy, causes, management and maternal and perinatal outcomes were collected from the patient charts of each woman. Major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) was one of the severe maternal morbidities in the EPIMOMS study. To be included as a MOH case, women had to be at least 22 weeks of gestation or more and had to meet one of the following criteria: 1. ≥1500mls blood loss; 2. blood transfusion ≥ 4 RBC; 3. uterine artery embolisation, ligation or compressive uterine sutures; 4. have an emergency peripartum hysterectomy; 5. Haemorrhage with organ dysfunction as per EPIMOMS definition.

The Netherlands: TeMpOH-1 was a national retrospective cohort study conducted between January 2011 and January 2013 in the Netherlands, which included 75% of all hospitals. Women were identified using records from blood transfusion services and birth registries of participating hospitals. Data were collected from medical records and included information about previous medical history, current pregnancy, causes of haemorrhage, haematological parameters, blood components, fluid resuscitation and surgical and medical management(PubMed ID31730187 and 30784827). Women who experienced an obstetric haemorrhage and had received at least one of the following were included: 1. four units or more of RBC ; 2. multicomponent blood transfusion (RBC and fresh frozen plasma and/or platelet concentrates); 3. plasma in addition to RBCs as a result of obstetric haemorrhage.

United Kingdom : Data from UK comes from a national surveillance system used to identify cases of massive transfusion from consultant led obstetric units nationally in the UK. Reporters were asked to complete a data collection form using the medical records of the women. Data were collected anonymously. During the period between June 2013 to July 2014, information on women who fulfilled the following criteria were included: 1. received 8 or more units of RBC transfused within 24 hours ; 2. 20 or more weeks of gestation. The United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System was used to identify the patients (https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/downloads/files/ukoss/forms/UKOSS-Major-Obstetric-Haemorrhage.pdf).

The primary objective will be answered using propensity score matching to ensure exchangeability between sPPH patients treated with NovoSeven® and those that were not across data from the Netherlands, Denmark and France (if these are comparable).

For exposed women: Time0 is defined as time of first administration of NovoSeven®. It occurs x minutes after onset of sPPH. For every exposed woman, all unexposed and eligible women are evaluated at this time=time0. The ones with similar propensity score are selected for matching (up to four will be selected). Thus, for unexposed women (matched controls): Time0 is the timepoint used when they were selected for matching. It is equal to the period from onset of sPPH to time of first administration of NovoSeven® for the patient for which they are a matched control. In this way exposed and unexposed women are comparable because they have similar propensity score at the same (specific) Time0.

Generally, the following approach will be taken:

* Propensity score models and matching will be performed separately by country
* Matching will be done within patients with the same delivery mode
* Pooling will be done after matching including all countries which allows formal analysis - this will be the primary population
* The primary analysis will be based on the pooled data - meaning there we will have 1 (primary) p-value for the primary endpoint
* Subgroup-analyses of the primary endpoint will be done by country - there we will have 1 (supportive) p-value per country

Propensity score matching will be performed to ensure comparability between women with an event of sPPH being exposed to NovoSeven® with women with an event of sPPH that are not exposed to NovoSeven at the matching timepoint. In this approach, the propensity score will reflect the estimated probability of being administered with NovoSeven® during the course of severe PPH. A propensity score for every woman with sPPH will be estimated by an appropriate analytic model with NovoSeven® as the dependent variable. Covariates associated with initiation of NovoSeven® administration will be included in a model to calculate propensity scores. Characteristics considered to be potential confounders for the association between use of NovoSeven® and the outcome or characteristics considered to be risk factors for the occurrence of the primary outcome measure alone will be included as covariates in the propensity score model.

Characteristics that could be included as covariates are (not an exhausted list): gestational age, multiple pregnancy, cause of PPH, volume of blood loss at time of intervention, and haemostatic drugs used (other than NovoSeven®) that had already been applied at the time of intervention. A matching algorithm for the propensity score will be used to match women with an event of sPPH exposed to NovoSeven® with women with an event of sPPH that are not at that timepoint. Women will be censored when they have been hysterectomised, dies, or stopped having PPH.

Matching will be done by up to 1:4 with a calliper of 0.1. If this is not possible a calliper of 0.2 will be used instead. The criteria for switching to 0.2 will be described in the SAP.

The estimand will address the relative effect of NovoSeven® compared to propensity score matched controls on the occurrence of invasive procedures in women with an event of sPPH. The five attributes of the estimand can be seen below. The estimand is defined from the following five elements outlined in the ICH E9(R1):

A. The treatment conditions are NovoSeven® vs. propensity scored matched controls not receiving NovoSeven®.

B. The treatment effect will be estimated for women with an event of sPPH defined by the inclusion criteria in the four cohorts exposed to NovoSeven® and their matched controls.

C. The treatment effect is assessed by the occurrence of invasive procedures within 20 minutes to 24 hours following time0.

D. Intercurrent events will be handled by a hypothetical strategy or a treatment policy strategy (further details in protocol Table 1).

E. The treatment effect will be quantified by the odds ratio.",COMPLETED,,2020-05-01,2021-01-31,2021-01-01,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,3322,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Eptacog alfa"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Recombinant coagulation factor VII activated"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Standard of care"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Patients have been treated according to local routine clinical practice at the discretion of the treating physician."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG;OTHER,eptacog alfa;standard of care,1

The end goal is to provide supporting documentation for the SpO2 accuracy validation of the ReNewal sensors.

It is required that the Accuracy Root Mean Square (ARMS) performance of the ReNewal pulse oximetry sensors will meet a specification of 3 or better in non-motion conditions for the range of 70 - 100% SaO2 thereby demonstrating an acceptable SpO2 accuracy performance specification.","An oximeter is a device used to transmit radiation at a known wavelength(s) through blood and to measure the blood oxygen saturation based on the amount of reflected or scattered radiation. Pulse oximetry monitoring is considered a standard physiological measurement and is used by clinicians in everyday situations to estimate arterial oxygen saturation. Because an arterial sample of blood is not required to make the measurement, the pulse oximeter can provide non-invasive real time information. The clinical use of pulse oximeters has reduced the frequency and necessity of invasive arterial blood sampling and has helped to improve patient safety by providing continuous information to clinicians about patients' oxygenation status.

The Medline ReNewal Reprocessed pulse oximeter sensors are indicated for single patient use when continuous noninvasive arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate monitoring are required. Following clinical use, each sensor is returned to Medline ReNewal where it is cleaned, disinfected, and packaged for an additional clinical use. Each sensor is tracked through the reprocessing cycle to monitor the number of times the sensor has been reprocessed. The purpose of this study will be to test the accuracy of the SpO2 component of the devices.

The SpO2 accuracy performance of ReNewal pulse oximetry sensors will be evaluated during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 and compared to arterial blood samples assessed by CO-Oximetry. A minimum of 10 healthy adult subjects, ranging in pigmentation from light to dark, will be enrolled in the study to meet the study design requirements defined by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 80601-2-61:2011 and by the FDA's Guidance for Pulse Oximeters (March 4, 2013). The subjects will have an arterial catheter placed in the radial artery to allow for simultaneous blood samples during stable plateaus of induced hypoxic levels. The investigational devices will be placed on the fingers of both hands for the test sites per the instructions for use. Simultaneous data collection will be set up for each of the systems under test. For the data analysis, the control oximeter will be used to assess the stability of each data point. Data that is found to be unstable will be removed prior to the comparative analysis. Next the CO-Oximeter data will be reviewed to make sure it does not contain any anomalous values such as elevated, low or inconsistent carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), methemoglobin (MetHb), or total hemoglobin (tHb) data. Anomalous values will be removed from the analysis prior to pairing of the SpO2 and SaO2 data. The Accuracy Root Mean Square (ARMS) calculation is used to determine the SpO2 accuracy performance. Success will be achieved with an ARMS of 3 or better showing equivalence to the Gold Standard Reference CO-Oximetry providing documentation to support SpO2 accuracy claims for the investigational device(s).

The secondary objectives are to correlate the dominant metabolic dependencies of TNBCs with pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy, and with the cancers' molecular signaling pathways assessed via NGS and RPPA.","One of the recognized hallmarks of cancer cells is deregulated cellular metabolism, characterized by enhanced metabolic autonomy compare with non-transformed cells. Tumor cells typically display an overall increase in glucose metabolism, associated with enhanced aerobic glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by a requirement for a high rate of protein, nucleotide, and fatty acid synthesis to provide the raw materials for cell division. 13C-glucose is a non-radioactive stable isotope tracer that has been widely used in vitro, in vivo, and in patients in a variety of disease settings to study glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, at steady state and following intervention. \[1,2-13C\] glucose can provide additional information on the activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway versus glycolysis. Administration of intravenous 13C-glucose is a convenient and affordable approach to analyzing the metabolomics of human cancers in their native microenvironments.

The metabolic dependencies of the various breast cancer subtypes are poorly understood. Importantly, in depth analyses of the in situ metabolic processes utilized by triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) using state-of-the-art in vivo \[1,2-13C\]-glucose infusions in patients with TNBC has never been done. In TNBC, oncogenic activation of key signaling pathways leads to altered metabolic programming resulting in an increased dependence on exogenous nutrients such as glucose and glutamine. These data further suggest a hypothesis that TNBCs may employ a cellular mechanism called macropinocytosis to ingest and degrade interstitial albumin to accumulate glutamine. This process may then be exploited for therapeutic gain through enhanced uptake by cells that utilize macropinocytosis to meet their metabolic requirements.

In this study, administration of \[1,2-13C\]-glucose to patients with TNBC will be done prior to patients undergoing a biopsy of their breast cancer as well as blood sample collection which will allow for in depth evaluation of glycolysis as well as lipid and amino acid metabolism by Joshua Rabinowitz, PhD, at Princeton University who is an international expert in cancer metabolomics.

The disorder presents with emotional, cognitive, behavioural, and somatic symptoms during the final premenstrual phase and subsiding a few days after menses begins. About 75% of women of reproductive age experience a mild form of PMS (Campbell, Peterkin, O'Grady, \& Sanson-Fisher, 1997). The more severe form of PMS, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD; American Psychiatric Association (APA), 1994) is considered to affect up to 8% of women of reproductive age. This severe form is associated with severe disruptions in normal functioning in work, family, or social relationships (Halbreich, Borenstein, Pearlstein, \& Kahn, 2003). The defining characteristics of both-PMS and PMDD- are the cyclic pattern of symptoms, which must be confirmed by prospective daily self ratings of symptoms (PMS-Diary) over two consecutive menstrual cycles (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), 2000). PMS and PMDD differ according to the number, severity, duration, and quality of symptoms.

As a first-line intervention, the ACOG suggests pharmacotherapy, in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; ACOG, 2000). However, the side effects of SSRIs are intolerable to many women, leading to high rates of withdrawal from treatment (Busse et al., 2009; Dimmock, Wyatt, Jones, \& O'Brien, 2000). Thus, cognitive behavioural treatments (CBT) have been suggested as an additional treatment approach (Busse et al., 2009). First studies showed promising results for CBT interventions for PMS (Busse et al., 2009; Hunter et al., 2002). However, too few randomized controlled trials have carefully investigated the efficacy of CBT for PMS.

The aim of the current study is thus to develop a CBT-oriented self-help treatment programme for women suffering from PMS or PMDD. The treatment programme consists of psychoeducation (e.g., information about PMS/PMDD and its aetiology), cognitive strategies (e.g., assessing and restructuring dysfunctional cognitions), and suggestions for lifestyle changes (e.g., sports, balanced diet, relaxation). The programme is internet-delivered (iCBT) and participants work on different chapters for eight weeks in a row. In addition to written information, participants receive e-mail feedback from a psychologist on a weekly basis. Participants are required to have sufficient knowledge of German in order to be able to read the treatment materials. After a careful diagnostic assessment (including two months symptom diary), eligible patients are randomly assigned either to the treatment group or a waitlist control group. Participants assigned to the waitlist receive the treatment after the end of the waiting period (eight weeks). Follow-up assessments take place six months after the end of the treatment.",COMPLETED,,2013-07,2018-04,2017-07,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,174,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Internet-based CBT for patients with PMS"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Internet-based cognitive-behavioural self-help treatment"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Waiting list"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""During the waiting period, participants receive no treatment."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BEHAVIORAL;OTHER,internet-based cbt for patients with pms;waiting list,1

OTHER,NCT00822679,Eszopiclone and Inflammatory Mediators in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome,Eszopiclone and Inflammatory Mediators in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome,"The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of Eszopiclone, a sleep aid, on inflammatory mediators and coagulability in patients with a recent myocardial infarction.","Abnormalities of sleep are common in hospitalized patients, but the mechanisms and consequences are not well understood. In many of these patients, sleep is very disrupted, occurs during the daytime, and circadian rhythm is diminished or lost. Hospitalized patients experience more frequent arousals and awakenings than is normal and show decreases in rapid eye movement and slow wave sleep. The degree of sleep fragmentation is at least equivalent to that seen in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. About 20% of arousals and awakenings are related to noise, 10% are related to health care personnel and care-related activities, and the cause for the remainder is not known, although severity of underlying disease is likely an important factor.

In studies of sleep following acute myocardial infarction, marked disturbances have been found in patients, whether in the ICU and on the wards. These disturbances include long periods of wakefulness; poor sleep efficiency, and disruption of REM sleep. The fact that there is also a loss in circadian rhythm in these patients may indicate a widespread disruption of bodily homeostasis which, in turn, may be related to the infarct itself, to a more generalized physiological response to stress or to other factors. Sleep disruption can induce sympathetic activation and elevation of blood pressure, which may contribute to patient morbidity.

It has been shown that there is an increased level of some inflammatory and coagulation factors in the recovery period following an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Post MI patients have higher levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and tissue plasminogen activator as well as lower levels of antithrombin III and protein C.

The aim of this study is to determine whether the sleep-aid Eszopiclone can improve sleep, decrease inflammation, and decrease pro-coagulation factors in patients who have recently suffered myocardial infarction when compared with a control group without sleep aids. Eszopiclone is a benzodiazepine receptor agonist which improves sleep quality by reducing the time to sleep onset and reduces wakefulness during the sleep period. Unlike benzodiazepines, it does not affect the deeper stage 3 and 4 sleep. The result is that it provides a more nearly normal night sleep than other sleep aids. It is hoped that improved sleep patterns will result in more rapid normalization of inflammatory and coagulation factors and perhaps more rapid recovery.",COMPLETED,,2007-10,2010-01,2009-08,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,5,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Eszopiclone"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Subject receives Eszopiclone for 3 consecutive nights. 3 mg orally at bedtime for patients age 64 and under, and 2 mg QHS for patients age 65 and older."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Placebo"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Subjects are given placebo for 3 consecutive nights"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG;OTHER,eszopiclone;placebo,1

OTHER,NCT04085679,Multidisciplinary Mobile Unit for Preventing Hospitalization of Nursing Home Residents,Implementation of a Strategy to Prevent Hospital Admission in Nursing Home Residents: Protocol of a Quasi-experimental Study,"Elderly patients residing in nursing homes are particularly at risk of experiencing urgent medical problems needing admission to the Emergency Department (ED). This circumstance contributes to ED overcrowding, increases the risk of ward admission of elderly patients, and puts them at an even higher risk of hospitalization-related adverse events. The study hypothesis is that a complex intervention, delivered directly in nursing homes by hospital physicians in case of urgent medical problems, would contribute to reduce hospitalization of older nursing home residents.

The intervention consists in a hospital-based ""multidisciplinary mobile unit"" (MMU), composed of a hospital specialist and a resident in emergency-urgency medicine who are coordinated by a senior physician serving as ""flow manager"". The team is active on work days, 8 am to 6 pm, and is activated by general practitioners of nursing homes, in case of urgent medical needs of one of the residents. The activation is made by a phone call to the ""flow manager"", who triages the clinical needs of the case. The output of the phone consultation may include therapeutic advice provided by phone, immediate on-site visit by the MMU team (specialist and resident), scheduled visit by the MMU team, or direct admission to the hospital unit where MMU is based, avoiding ED visits. The MMU team is provided with a portable ultrasound system, an essential set of drugs and medical devices useful in a urgency setting (central venous lines, nasogastric tubes, rectal tubes, bladder catheters). During on-site visits, the MMU team performs diagnosis, stabilization and therapeutic advice, with the mission of avoiding ED visits and hospital admissions whenever possible.

The MMU intervention is already active in two nursing homes, since December 2018. The aim of this prospective, pragmatic, multicenter, quasi-experimental study (sequential design with two cohorts) is to test the effects of the implementation of the MMU care model in terms of reduction of unplanned hospitalization rates (primary outcomes), mortality, health service use and costs (secondary outcomes).

Two nursing homes (i.e., the ones who already benefit from the intervention) will serve as study group, and two nursing homes with similar geographical location will serve as control group. All residents of the participating nursing homes will be eligible for study inclusion. The study will last for 18 months, and a number of 338 residents is planned for inclusion.","The study is based in the University Hospital of Parma, which has a catchment area of more than 400,000 inhabitants, of whom 22.3% is over 65 years old. It provides the only Emergency service of the district, and it ranks fourth in Italy by number of ED visits (yearly average of over 110,000). The average admission rate of the adult ED population is 18%, of which 65% concern people older than 65.

In the last two decades, the University Hospital of Parma has implemented several innovative initiatives to manage the hospital flow of frail multimorbid patients and their complex needs. These initiatives included bed management to avoid ""bed-blockers"", physician accountability for the discharge process, and creation of a dedicated hospital unit, organized by intensity of care to anticipate the needs of these patients preserving high performance indices. This unit, called Internal Medicine and Critical Subacute Care Unit, performs over 3,500 urgent admissions of frail multimorbid elderly patients per year, with an average length of stay that in 30% of cases is lower than 3 days.

Participating nursing homes are public facilities which ensure the presence of nursing staff 24 hours a day and of a physician at least 4 hours a day (high-intensity care facilities). The possible role of distance to the hospital is considered by including in each group one nursing home located next to the hospital and one located \>5 km of distance.

This study follows a multimethod approach, based on the MRC framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions, including the development, feasibility assessment, and evaluation phases.

1. Development of the intervention First, the different types of approaches reported in the literature, described above, were considered. The ""prevention approach"", interventions conducted in nursing homes, was chosen as the most suitable strategy to integrate the hospital's organizational model already in place, as it can target both hospitalization rates and ED overcrowding, allowing to intervene before the person accesses the hospital.

   Available evidence also prompted us to opt for a multicomponent approach. In fact, data from qualitative interviews reveal that the decision to transfer residents to hospital may be influenced by different factors, such as staffing and skill mix in the nursing homes, treatment options available in the facility, end-of-life decision-making, and communication and bureaucratic requirements. This multifactorial association means that a multicomponent intervention is likely to be more effective than a single-component intervention.

   The choice of employing a mobile geriatric specialist service was supported by the positive results obtained by the two controlled studies which examined similar interventions. One study evaluated a service where a physician did regular and on-call visits intended to provide services otherwise associated with hospitalization. The other study evaluated an ambulant team with a nurse and a physician, doing comprehensive geriatric assessments of residents as well as reviewing medications and providing support to staff. The proposed intervention does not involve a nurse, unlike the second of the mentioned studies, because in the participating facilities nursing staff is available 24 hours a day. Unlike the experience of the second study, moreover, periodic visits on site will not be performed in the present investigation, since routine clinical management and scheduled follow-up is already performed by nursing home physicians.

   Finally, medical hospital staff was preferred to community geriatricians, on the assumption that older patients may feel more comfortable being handled by physicians who may have already cared for them at the hospital. Moreover, hospital staff enables direct patient referral to the ward. Finally, this allows the use of diagnostic technologies available at the hospital, which can be used immediately without the need for hospital admission.

   The MMU care model intervention The model hinges on the strong collaboration between hospital and nursing home staff to provide residents with patient-centered care. It entails a multicomponent intervention which is integrated in standard care and comprises three steps: 1) MMU team activation, 2) on site visit by a team of physicians with geriatric expertise, 3) interdisciplinary care planning.

   Step 1: MMU team activation

   Patient selection is necessary to ensure that available resources are used for patients who may really benefit. To this end, the nursing home physician contacts by phone the ""flow manager"", a skilled internist with strong clinical expertise, organizational attitude and managerial training, during the 8 a.m.-6 p.m. time frame, Monday to Friday. The phone consultation is reported on a form containing the description of the patient's clinical condition and a summary of the conversation. The form also indicates which decision was reached among the following 6 not mutually exclusive options:
   1. The patient can be managed by nursing home staff, therapeutic advice is provided by phone
   2. Remote reassessment is scheduled after a number of hours agreed upon by the team
   3. The MMU team is dispatched for evaluation, treatment and stabilization on site
   4. A significant change in vital parameters is observed which requires immediate activation of emergency services
   5. Direct hospital admission is considered necessary
   6. Ambulatory outpatient visits or tests are planned

   Step 2: on site visit by a team of physicians with geriatric expertise Visits at the nursing home are performed by two members of the MMU team: an expert hospital physician chosen on a case-by-case basis among the clinical staff of the Internal Medicine and Critical Subacute Care Unit, which comprises internists, gastroenterologists, geriatricians, specialists in clinical nutrition, depending on the disease or clinical problem that must be treated, and a specifically trained resident in Emergency Medicine.

   The team is provided with a car to reach the nursing homes, a portable ultrasound system, and an essential set of drugs and medical devices useful in an emergency setting. The ultrasound system is equipped with three probes (convex, linear, and phased-array) for performing thoraco-pulmonary, cardiac, vascular, abdominal and soft tissue ultrasound, when required. Available drugs include those that can be administered intravenously for treating urgent conditions (e.g. loop diuretics, steroids, fluids, antibiotics). Devices include central and peripheral venous lines, naso-gastric and rectal tubes and bladder catheters. Blood tests can also be performed.

   Step 3: interdisciplinary care planning. Based on the results of the visit and of any performed investigations, the MMU team formulates personalized advice and referrals, and discusses these with the nursing home physician. If stabilization on site is not deemed possible, the MMU team plans a direct admission to the Internal Medicine and Critical Subacute Care Unit, thus avoiding ED access. The planning and the final outcome of the intervention are recorded in the second part of the form.
2. Feasibility assessment A pilot phase of 5 months (December 2018-April 2019) was conducted in two nursing homes in order to look at feasibility of the MMU care Model described above. Before the intervention was introduced, meetings were held with nursing home staff to agree on activation modalities.

   In this period, 99 phone calls were received, of which 84 required MMU team onsite visits, and 15 were managed with remote consultancy. Of the latter, 3 required direct admission after remote phone consultancy. Only 4 of the 84 patients visited onsite required direct admission. One patient was sent to the ED for massive intestinal bleeding.

   This phase demonstrated the feasibility of the intervention, and did not highlight any need for modifications.
3. Evaluation phase Aim and objectives The study aim is to verify the effects of the implementation of the MMU care model tested in the pilot phase.

Primary objective is to verify reduction of unplanned hospitalization rates in the nursing homes of the intervention group compared to the nursing homes in the control group. Secondary objectives are to measure the effects of the intervention in terms of mortality, health service use, and costs.

Study Design. This study is a prospective, pragmatic, multicenter, quasi-experimental study (sequential design with two cohorts), in which usual nursing home care is compared to care provided by applying the MMU model.

Study Population. All residents of the participating nursing homes are eligible, regardless of their clinical status. Residents who do not provide informed consent will be excluded.

Usual Care. Patients in the control cohort receive usual care, which means the actions to take are decided by the nursing home staff. Generally, this implies that patients who are clinically unstable, or require urgent instrumental tests, will be sent to the ED.

Measures. Baseline variables. Demographic data on gender and age are collected by chart review.

Outcome variables. The primary outcome is hospitalization rate, considering at the numerator all unplanned admissions occurred during a 1-year period, and at the denominator the sum of the person-time of the at risk population (days of stay at the nursing home). For the intervention group, the numerator corresponds to options c) and d) defined in ""Step 1: MMU team activation"".

Secondary outcomes:

* Crude all-cause Death Rate (CDR): the number of deaths during a 1-year period on person-time of the at risk population
* Hospital Mortality rate: the frequency of patients who die while in the hospital (death rate/1000)
* Length of stay (LOS): the duration of a single episode of hospitalization. Inpatient days are calculated by subtracting day of admission from day of discharge.
* Adverse events or complications: frequency of events occurred within 48 hours from MMU team activation and subsequent patient stabilization, for which hospital access becomes necessary.
* Costs analysis, comparing the cost differences in the two groups

Data Collection. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics are collected at baseline to describe the study population and determine factors associated with hospital rate. Participants' files and electronic data are stored securely at the study site (e.g. locked area, password protected hard- and software). Data integrity will be scrutinized with several strategies (e.g. valid values, range checks, consistency checks). Patient data are only identifiable with the unique participant's number. Personal information will be collected and saved in a separate file (on a different server) which can only be accessed by the Principal Investigator (PI). This information will be used by the PI to retrieve data on any hospital admissions (length of stay, in-hospital death ...) from administrative databases (discharge summaries, ED data, Death Registry). Residents' identification data will be deleted once the study is completed, making the dataset anonymous. All study protocol authors will have access to the anonymous dataset.

Cost analysis. The investigators will identify the changes in net costs associated with one-year exposure to the intervention, consisting in the induced costs due to incremental resource inputs for carrying out the intervention and hospital health service utilization costs. Staffing costs will be calculated considering the time spent by the professionals involved in the intervention. Non-staff running costs include expenses of MMU staff travelling to and from the nursing home. The health service utilization costs will be identified based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) system.

Statistical Methodology. Sample size calculation. The number of subjects to include was estimated using the findings of one study, a large quasi-experimental trial. Thus, considering 56 cases vs 32 cases per 100 residents, and using a 2-sided, large-samples z-test of the Poisson incidence rate difference at a significance level of 0.05, and with a power of 0.90, overall 338 residents should be enrolled.

Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize patient populations and will be presented as means and standard deviations (SD) when normally distributed, or as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR).

For the primary analysis the investigators will used Poisson regression with robust standard errors (SEs) to evaluate relative differences in hospital rates among the two cohorts while adjusting for demographic characteristics.

Concerning the secondary outcomes, the following analyses will be performed:

* Rates will be compared considering the quotient between the intervention and control groups
* A lognormal model will be used to compare in-hospital LOS.
* Chi square tests will be conducted for categorical data as adverse events or complications
* For costs, the investigators will use the following equations to summarize the annual net costs associated with the implementation of the intervention. Any costs with negative values mean ""savings"" and any costs with positive values mean ""losses"". Net costs ˆ A...(intervention costs) +‡ B (Costs for differences in hospital health service utilization) where: A= intervention: staffing costs+intervention: non- staff costs and B= Costs for differences in inpatient care utilization. Therefore, the net costs arising from one-year implementation of the intervention as compared with the current practice will be obtained, where a negative value of net costs represents ""cost-saving"" and a positive value represents ""not cost-saving""

The demographic and clinical variables which influence the outcome with a p value\<0.20 in the univariate analysis will be included in the Poisson regression model.

The analyses will be performed using SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and STATA-SE 11 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA).",TERMINATED,The local Healthcare authorities extended the planned intervention to all nursing homes of the district after the emergence of multiple outbreaks of severe COVID-19 in several nursing homes.,2020-01-15,2020-12-30,2020-12-30,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,13,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Multidisciplinary Mobile Unit (MMU)"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""MMU is called in case of urgent clinical situations involving patients residing in nursing home"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER,multidisciplinary mobile unit (mmu),0

It has been determined that dyspnea that persists three and six months after hospital discharge is associated with peak oxygen consumption in hospitalized and discharged COVID-19 patients, while peak oxygen consumption decreases in patients with dyspnea.The effects of inspiratory muscle training have been investigated in different lung diseases. In these studies, it was reported that inspiratory muscle training increased respiratory muscle strength and endurance, exercise capacity and quality of life, and decreased fatigue and dyspnea. In addition, it has been found that high-intensity interval aerobic exercise training increases exercise capacity in patients with lung disease and heart failure.In heart failure patients, it was found that high-intensity interval aerobic exercise training increased peak oxygen consumption more than moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise training.Patients need exercise training because symptoms such as lung involvement, decreased exercise capacity, dyspnea and fatigue continue after the disease in patients who have had COVID-19.

OTHER,NCT05879679,Pilot Study on the Validity of the Metacognitive Hub Model of Craving in Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and Binge Eating Disorders (BED),Pilot Study on the Validity of the Metacognitive Hub Model of Craving in Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and Binge Eating Disorders (BED),"Craving is defined as an irrepressible urge to consume certain products and represents one of the key factors in severe substance use disorders, as illustrated by its recent inclusion as a diagnostic criterion in the most recent fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5). However, the pathophysiological models of craving remain debated.

The ""metacognitive hub model"", a conceptual, experimental and clinical approach to craving, proposes that craving should be considered as the embedded consequence of the interaction between three components (the reflexive, automatic and interoceptive systems), each of which has an implicit and explicit element. This model links the three components by suggesting that metacognitive abilities, the ability to understand one's own cognitive functioning, may be a skill of individuals that allows them to make the three sub-components explicit or not.

To date, the conception of eating disorders is increasingly similar to that of addictive disorders. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the symptomatology of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder can be considered in part as an ""food addiction"" and would fit the diagnostic criteria of an addictive disorder. Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder (DSM 5) characterized by a cycle of binge eating and compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting that tend to negate or compensate for the effects of the binge eating. Binge eating disorder (DSM 5) is characterized by a cycle of binge eating, but without the compensatory behaviors seen in bulimia nervosa. In addition, there are common neurological aspects as well as similar cognitions between these eating disorders and addictive disorders. Given the importance of craving in addictive pathology, it seems essential to address this issue in bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. The cognitive difficulties of patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, which are close to the difficulties observed in patients with addictive behaviors, suggest that the ""metacognitive hub model"" could provide a clear and measurable theoretical framework of the different dimensions of craving.

The overall objective of this project is to explore the relationship between the level of craving induced by food picture exposure and the level of impairment of the reflexive, automatic, interoceptive, and metacognitive systems in women with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder and to compare these impairments according to the nature of the eating disorder (i.e., binge eating versus bulimia nervosa).

Our hypotheses are:

1. the induction of food craving will affect the reflexive, automatic, and interoceptive systems of patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.
2. the magnitude of the effect of food craving induction on implicit craving and explicit craving will be modulated by the participants' metacognitive abilities.",,RECRUITING,,2024-01-08,2025-10,2025-09,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,60,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Food craving induction"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Standardized craving induction procedure will be used, based on exposure to food-related images (https://www.lippc2s.fr/food-cal-pictures/).

Randomized trials were performed up to doses of 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Nevertheless, the five-year biochemical relapse rate still was approximately 35% in the high-dose arm. Therefore further dose escalation seems to be required. A feasibility study up to appr. 85 Gy on the entire prostate has already been performed and showed acceptable toxicity when combined with adequate position verification. Higher doses to the entire prostate are expected to increase severe toxicity. As local recurrences only occur at the site of the primary macroscopic tumour area the next step in increasing the dose should be an ablative boost to the macroscopic tumour alone, while electively irradiating the rest of the prostate to the current gold standard dose. Feasibility of this approach has been shown for an ablative dose of 95 Gy to the macroscopic tumour within the prostate.","Objective:

* Primary study objective: To demonstrate the superiority of the ablative microboost dose schedule regarding 5-year biochemical no evidence of disease rate compared to the current standard of care.
* Secondary study objectives: Establish and compare the rates of treatment-related toxicity, quality of life and disease-free survival.

Study design: Single blind prospective randomized controlled phase III trial.

Study population: Patients with intermediate or high risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Intermediate or high risk is defined according to the Ash et al. 2000 criteria as:

* One (intermediate-risk) or more (high-risk) factors: T2, or Gleasonscore=7, or iPSA 10-20 ng/mL
* One or more (high-risk) factors: T3, or Gleasonscore \>7, or iPSA \>20 ng/mL

Intervention: The standard arm receives the current gold standard, namely 77Gy to the prostate in 35 fractions of 2.2 Gy, 5 times per week. In the experimental arm patients receive in addition to the current gold standard of 77 Gy to the prostate an integrated boost to the macroscopically visible tumour to reach a total dose of 95 Gy in 35 fractions of 2.7 Gy, 5 times per week.

Main study endpoint: To decrease the five-year biochemical relapse rate with at least 10%.

Long term exposure of arsenic causes keratosis of palm which reduce working capacity of patient. It also causes invasive skin lesions like Bowen's disease which has a risk to develop squamous cell carcinoma. Brinjal peel is well known for its antioxidant and anticancer properties. So this study will be conducted to identify the compound from brinjal peel extract and to see its outcome on keratosis and Bowen's disease.,"Arsenicosis is a major health problem in Bangladesh. About half of the population are chronically exposed to high concentration of arsenic through contaminated drinking water. In arsenicosis, keratosis of palm and sole occur which reduce the working capacity of the patient and affect the socioeconomic condition. It also causes invasive skin lesions like Bowen's disease, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. Bowen's disease usually appears as a persistent reddened scaly patch on the skin and has a risk (3-5%) to develop squamous cell carcinoma. Keratosis can be treated by different topical preparations like salicylic acid, propylene glycol and oral antioxidant, zinc and folic acid, but treatment by these medicines require a longer time to relieve and thus reduce patient's compliance. On the other hand, treatment options available for Bowen's disease are expensive. Brinjal is a common vegetable which contains steroidal alkaloids, steroidal glycosides, delphinidine, nasunin and other biologically active compounds. These biologically active compounds are effective against human cancer cells by various mechanisms. One study shows that a topical cream prepared from brinjal peel extract is effective in keratosis and skin carcinoma. So, this study will be conducted to see the outcome of brinjal peel extract in severe palmar arsenical keratosis and Bowen's disease and to identify the compound that is responsible for the effect.

Aim of study:

Predictive value in mortality of ECG abnormalities in patients with isolated Traumatic brain injury (TBI).","Traumatic brain Injury (TBI) is a brain affection occurring due to whether external blunt or penetrating trauma applied to the head. It may results from gun-shot, car accident, falling, assault or even suicide. Recently, TBI is considered one of the major leading causes to disability and death . Also variant neurological diseases e.g. neurodegenerative and demential diseases are reported as long term complication of TBI . According to Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) TBI is defined as an external force applied to the head that causes varying degrees of damage to the brain and classified into mild, moderate and sever types according to Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Globally in 2014, epidemiological estimations reported 2.53 million TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits from CDC documentation and in 2019, incidence of TBI was 27.16 million accounting for 346 per 100,000 populations and affecting the global economy what made it a major public health problem.

As TBI is a comorbid, disabling and a significant factor in world-wide morality; a lot of research papers are conducted concerning pathophysiology, epidemiology, risk factors, management, and treatment especially in neurosurgical field. From etiological view, falling is the most common factor for TBI followed by motor and motor-cyclic accidents. Concerning of age, the most vularnable group is elderly people who aged above 65 years followed by pediatrics aged below 4 years .

Epidemiologic estimates about TBI and its mortality rate faces difficulty because of some mild cases don't go to ED and some of sever cases died after accident.

in the last decade, research papers reported electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and abnormalities in patients with brain injury whether it is pathological as stroke or traumatic by external force.

One of the most common negative consequences of aging is the decline in muscle mass, strength and power. This is most notable in lower limb muscles. These muscles are required for the performance of daily activities including walking, stair climbing and standing up from sitting. Regular exercise is considered one of the most effective measures to slow, and even reverse the progression of muscle weakness. Nevertheless older adults may notice a decline in their capability to undertake regular exercises, this may be due to a decline in their muscle's ability to buffer pH. Carnosine (made by bonding β-alanine and histidine) has been suggested to contribute to the extension of physical performance, counteracting the decline the muscle's ability to buffer pH. Yet this pH buffering process it largely restricted by the amount of β-alanine available in the human body. β-alanine is already known to decline in older individuals due to a reduction in food products (meat, fish and poultry). Yet through either consumption of β-alanine rich food, or through short-term supplementation, β-alanine is raised, increasing carnosine concentrations. Improved β-alanine levels can potentially advance exercise performance, for example significant improvements in time to exhaustion on both a constant (37%) and incremental (12%) treadmill tests have been demonstrated. It is therefore proposed that via β-alanine supplementation, an individual's perception of their frailty, maintenance of health and independent living can be improved in older individuals.

OTHER,NCT02944279,Neutrophil Elastase and Elafin as Prognostic Biomarker for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,,"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by alveolar flooding with protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid, is one of the most common disease in the intensive care unit (ICU) throughout the world. In recent years, much effort has been focused on the biological markers for their potential values to diagnose ARDS and outcomes.

ARDS is generally accompanied by the disruption in alveolar-capillary barrier permeability, which subsequently caused an influx of neutrophils into the interstitium and alveolar space. It was reported that the aggregation, adhesion activation and release proteases of neutrophils are the key pathogenesis of ARDS pulmonary edema. Neutrophil Elastase (HNE), the most crucial protease generated in neutrophil azurophilic granules, plays an important role in various inflammations, especially the lung injury. The destructive action of HNE on almost all extracellular matrix influences cell signaling through cleavage of surface receptors. Once released in circulation, HNE is rapidly inactivated by conjugation with PI3. This local inhibitor reduces HNE mediated tissue injury and inflammation. Thus, the investigators plan to conduct a cohort study with repeated measures to examine the diagnostic and prognostic value of HNE and PI3 for ARDS.",,COMPLETED,,2011-01,2014-08,2014-08,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,500,ACTUAL,[],,,1

The investigators hypothesis is that LumaScan will be comparable for cancer detection to conventional histopathologic evaluation of the same areas of breast tissue. The real time, intraoperative images provided by LumaScan will help improve BCS and lessen the need for BCS re-excision surgeries which can lead to higher cost, poor cosmetic outcomes, reduced survival rates, and loss of confidence in the tissue conservation surgery procedure.","LumaScan is an innovative polarization microscope that uses Polarization Subtraction Imaging (PSI) technology to provide real time, intra operative, digital images of the surface of tissue removed during BCS for breast cancer. PSI uses polarized visible light for optical sectioning and geometric imaging of the superficial layers of the surgically removed tissue while rejecting surface scatter and light from deeper layers. By rejecting light from deeper tissues PSI is able to exclusively focus on the superficial tissue layers. This also results in higher resolution images than are possible with standard optical imaging. PSI is used in both reflectance and fluorescence modes. Reflectance detects morphologic abnormalities that occur in tumor progression such as increased nuclear density, angiogenesis, cellular infiltration and crowding while fluorescence detects early biochemical changes.

To enhance the contrast of tumor at the margins the investigators will use Methylene blue (MB), a dye that has been commonly used in breast surgery for mapping sentinel lymph nodes. MB can be administered peritumorally and is quickly taken up by cells in only a few minutes of exposure and its presence does not interfere with or preclude later histopathology on the same tissue specimen. A tumor specimen may also be dipped in MB post-excision to achieve tumor margin contrast enhancement and not interfere with pathologic assessment.

Previous research using PSI technology has demonstrated the value of PSI in mapping tumor boundaries of breast cancer in excised tissue specimens and in non-melanoma skin cancers and these boundaries in side by side comparisons correlate well with those marked by a pathologist on representative sections prepared using standard H\&E staining procedures.",UNKNOWN,,2014-01,2015-11,2015-09,INTERVENTIONAL,EARLY_PHASE1,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,40,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""LumaScan Image Guided Surgery"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE,lumascan image guided surgery,0

The management of postoperative pain and agitation after AT is still a controversial issue. Safety considerations limit the use of opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, leading to inadequate control of the high levels of postoperative pain experienced by AT patients. Along with pain killers, non-pharmacological strategies have remarkable impact on pain management in children. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet in 2015 on adult patients suggest that auditory stimulation with music in the perioperative setting, and even when patients are under general anaesthesia, can reduce postoperative pain, anxiety, and analgesia needs. The authors concluded that there is sufficient evidence to implement auditory stimulation in the treatment of all adult surgical patients, regardless of the mode of administration. Up to now, no research has investigated the effects of intraoperative auditory stimulation on pain and agitation upon awakening after AT in the pediatric population.

II. Study setting and location:

National Cancer Institute, Cairo University after approval by the institutional review board.

III. Study population:

Adult patients undergoing unilateral nephrectomy under general anesthesia.

Patients will be randomly assigned to the groups using online random number generator.

Erector Spinae Plane Block technique:

Informed consent, including the risks and benefits of the procedure, should be obtained before carrying out an ESP block. A peri-procedural ""timeout"" should be performed to confirm the type, side, and location of the procedure and ensure that there are no contraindications.

Standard patient monitoring should be in place, including continuous ECG monitoring, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure measurement in at least 5-minute intervals. Patients should be prepped and draped in sterile conditions. Sterile gloves and surgical cap and a mask are necessary, and the ultrasound probe is placed into the sterile ultrasound probe cover for imaging. The ESP block will be performed at the level of T 10 paraspinal level. The ultrasound transducer should be placed in a cephalocaudal orientation over the midline of the back at the desired level. The probe should then slowly be moved laterally until the transverse process is visible. The transverse process requires differentiation from the rib at that level. The transverse process will be more superficial and wider, while the rib will be deeper and thinner. Erector spinae muscle should be identified superficial to the transverse process. The needle should be inserted superior to the ultrasound probe using an in-plane approach in the cephalad to caudal direction. Once the needle tip is below the erector spinae muscle, a small bolus of local anesthetic should be given through the needle. The erector spinae muscle should be visualized, separating from the transverse process. This separation from the transverse process confirms the proper needle position.

The local anesthetic should then be injected in 5 ml increments, with aspiration after every 5 ml to prevent intravascular injection. Block will be performed preoperatively in the preoperative holding area.

Heart rate and blood pressure to be recorded preoperative, intraoperative and postoperatively

Assessment of pain:

Pain assessment will be done through Visual Analogue Scale. Patients should be informed preoperatively about it and how to use this scale. Starting from recovery time, pain assessment is done by asking the patient to mark the intensity of pain perceived and express it on a 10 cm horizontal scale ranging from no pain at one end to the worst possible pain at the other end.

Assessment of pain is to be done in the recovery unit and at 0,2,4,8,12,18, 24 and 30 hours postoperatively.

Total amount of opioid needed in first 24 hours to be recorded.

Rescue Analgesia:

Intraoperative rescue analgesia will be done by giving fentanyl at dose of 1 mic/Kg.

Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial (Wheat vs Placebo) for Bio-markers Identification of NCWS and Understanding Its Pathogenetic Mechanisms.,"The aim of the investigators' study is to evaluate biochemical, immunological and histological characteristics of patients affected with the so-called ""gluten (or wheat) sensitivity"" who suffers from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms.

As it is not known what component of the cereals causes the symptoms in so called ""gluten-sensitive"" patients, the investigators prefer to speak of ""not-celiac wheat sensitivity"" (NCWS).

NCWS patients may be defined as ones, neither celiac or allergic to wheat, who develop symptoms following wheat consumption, that improved on wheat/gluten free diet (GFD). For our research, we will select adult patients, both genders, affected with suspected NCWS (i.e. with symptoms/signs which disappeared on GFD and worsen on a gluten containing diet, testing negative for celiac disease \[anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, anti-tTG, and anti-endomysium antibodies, EMA, and with biopsy Marsh 0-1\] and wheat allergy \[serum specific IgE for wheat\]). The patients will be recruited at the Department of Internal Medicine, 'Giovanni Paolo II' Hospital of Sciacca (Agrigento), and of Internal Medicine of the University of Palermo, from January 2012 to October 2013, for IBS-like symptoms.

At the time of the recruitment, the patients will be on GFD by at least one month and must be asymptomatic. A more restricted elimination diet (with the exclusion of cow's milk, egg and other foods) could be prescribed in patients who are suspected to suffer from multiple food hypersensitivity. The patients will be randomized to undergo a double-blind placebo-controlled study, assuming wheat flour or placebo, administered daily for 15 days. Before and after the challenge, the investigators will evaluate gastrointestinal (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, GSRS) and the investigators will collect blood and fecal sampling and biopsies from endoscopic evaluation (both esophagogastroduodenoscopy and rectoscopy, with multiple biopsies), for the identification of possible markers (serological, biochemical, immunological, histological features, expression of cytokines and other constitutive mucosal proteins from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mucosal lymphocytes and fecal biomarkers) that may be of help to diagnose the condition of NCWS and to understand its pathogenesis.","Gluten is the most important protein component of some grains, notably wheat, rye, and barley, which are the basis for a variety of wheat-derived alimentary products consumed throughout the world (bread, pasta, pizza etc). However the ""engineering"" of gluten-containing grains created the conditions for human diseases related to gluten exposure. These forms of gluten intolerance represent a heterogeneous set of conditions, including celiac disease, wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity (GS), that, combined, seems to affect about 10% of the general population. The frequency of not-celiac GS is however still unknown, even though it is possible that this condition have been undiagnosed and under-diagnosed by the physicians for a long time. The immune responsiveness to wheat antigens represents a complex process, and its establishment and maintenance are not completely elucidated. The most frequent diseases caused by wheat ingestion are T cell-mediated disorders, i.e. celiac disease and IgE-mediated allergic reactions. However, besides celiac disease and wheat allergy, there are cases of gluten reactions in which neither autoimmune nor IgE-mediated allergic mechanisms are involved. These are generally defined as GS. Some subjects, who experience symptoms when eating gluten-containing products and show improvement when following a gluten-free diet (GFD), may have GS instead of celiac disease or wheat allergy. GS patients are unable to tolerate gluten and develop an adverse reaction when eating gluten, that, usually, and differently from celiac disease, does not lead to small intestinal damage. Gastrointestinal symptoms in GS patients may resemble those associated with celiac disease, but the overall clinical picture is generally less severe and is not accompanied by the occurrence of autoantibodies (i.e. anti-tTG or EMA) or autoimmune disease (i.e. Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Typically, the diagnosis is made by exclusion, and an elimination diet and an ""open challenge"" (i.e., the monitored reintroduction of gluten-containing foods) are most often used to evaluate whether health improves or worsen with the elimination or reintroduction of gluten in the diet, respectively. Gluten-sensitivity can cause both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms; among the former, the most frequent are IBS-like symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation and alternate bowel habit. However, as it is not known what component of the cereals causes the symptoms in so called ""gluten-sensitive"" patients, we prefer to speak of ""Not-celiac wheat sensitivity"" (NCWS). Furthermore, in our experience, NCWS patients can suffer from multiple food hypersensitivity and need of a more restricted diet with the elimination of cow's milk, egg and other foods, in addition to wheat. For these reasons, before to undergo the gluten challenge, the patients will undergo an oligoantigenic diet.

This study has two major aims:

1. Evaluation of the effective dependence from the wheat of the IBS-like manifestations presented by subjects with suspected NCWS. The study will be done after a period of GFD, comparing two groups of suspected NCWS subjects: administering wheat flour or placebo (for 15 days).
2. Identification of possible markers (serological, biochemical, immunological, histological features, expression of cytokines and other constitutive mucosal proteins from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mucosal lymphocytes and fecal biomarkers) that may be of help to diagnose the condition of NCWS. In particular, the investigators will search for markers of NCWS in the colon mucosa of the patients with IBS-like symptoms.",RECRUITING,,2012-01-01,2026-12-01,2016-01-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,DIAGNOSTIC,100,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""wheat flour"", ""type"": ""DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT"", ""description"": ""wheat flour is administered three times per day for 15 days"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Xylose"", ""type"": ""DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT"", ""description"": ""Xylose will be administered three times per day for 15 days"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT;DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT,wheat flour;xylose,0

Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is usually defined as a reduction in nociceptive thresholds in the peripheral field of the sensitized fibers \[Koppert et al., 2003\], and it is associated with increased pain and higher demand for postoperative analgesia \[Guignard et al., 2000\]. This phenomenon adversely impacts pain control, and has been suggested to occur in the peri-operative context, especially associated with the use of remifentanil, a short-acting opioid \[Guignard et al., 2000\].

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hyperalgesia phenomenon, but the most important seems to be the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors \[Célèrier et al., 2000\]. Ketamine is a NMDA receptor antagonist that has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and the need for postoperative anesthetics and analgesics. Therefore, it is proposed that ketamine could prevent hyperalgesia, resulting in more effective and long-lasting postsurgical analgesia \[Célèrier et al. 2000\].

The results of studies of low dose of ketamine in the prevention of remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia are controversial. Joly et al. \[2005\] demonstrated a reduction in the consumption of opioids and in hyperalgesia assessed with monofilaments. However, Engelhardt et al \[2008\] showed no differences in pain scores or in postoperative opioid consumption.

In addition, some authors observed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, associated with increased pain in mice receiving chronic opioid (morphine) infusion \[Johnston et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2008\]. Also, administration of proinflammatory cytokine inhibitors reduced phosphorylation of NMDA receptors \[Zhang et al., 2008\]. However, no study has examined the relationship between the use of remifentanil, the most frequently implicated opioid in OIH \[Guignard et al., 2000\], ketamine (drug capable of inhibiting NMDA-receptors and cytokines) \[Dale et al., 2012\], and the inflammatory response.

The aim of this study was to determine if the addition of ketamine reduces remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, improves its analgesic effect, inhibits IL-6 and IL-8 (inflammatory cytokines), and stimulates IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) in patients submitted to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a procedure with an usually neglected potential for postoperative pain and that has been poorly investigated in association with OIH.",COMPLETED,,2010-09,2012-09,2012-09,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,PREVENTION,60,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Ketamine"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Patients in group ketamine was administrated ketamine (5mcg/kg/min) during the surgery."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Saline"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Patients in group N (placebo) was administrated saline during surgery."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG;DRUG,ketamine;saline,1

Surgical and radiation therapy in the head and neck, as well as deficiencies such as poor coordination, mistiming, or obstructing lesions may prevent the food bolus from safely entering the esophagus and instead diverting toward the trachea.

A number of patients with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia are not able to tolerate any diet without risking aspiration and subsequent pneumonia, often to a degree severe enough that they cannot manage to safely swallow their secreted saliva. These patients depend on a gastrostomy feeding tube in order to obtain adequate daily nutritional requirements and must suction or spit out their saliva to prevent aspiration and a sensation of asphyxiation.

（1）Case selection： Patients requiring elective surgical treatment in the Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease Hospital of General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University.

Inclusion criteria: Patients were gender-neutral and aged ≥18 years.

（2) Clinical study protocol： Patients were admitted to the operating room to establish intravenous access, connected to ECG monitoring, EEG monitoring, 4L/min mask oxygenation, and real-time video recording of the entire anesthesia induction process using a video recorder for postoperative integration of various data. Propofol was pumped in at 100 mg/kg/h, and the anesthesiologist with propofol assessed the degree of sedation of the patient until the patient was deeply sedated and the MOAA/S score was 0, and the pumping of propofol was stopped.

(3) Observation indicators： Demographic information and general preoperative data were collected, including patients' gender, age, weight, height, ASA classification, body mass index (BMI), and past medical history (hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, respiratory disease, stroke).

Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, finger pulse oximetry (SPO2), electroencephalogram waveforms, the dosage of propofol administered from the start of anesthesia induction to MOAA/S = 0, and the time of administration of propofol were recorded for all the basic and extended monitoring parameters, respectively, after the patient was admitted to the operating room and at the time of the 0 score of the MOAA/S score.

(4) Evaluation methods of each item Depth of anesthesia assessment: MOAA/S depth of sedation was used for assessment, and MOAA/S score of 4-5 was classified as mild sedation, which indicated that the response to calling names in normal tone was sensitive or slow; 2-3 was classified as moderate sedation, which indicated that there was a response to calling names loudly or repeatedly, or there was a response to slight pushing and vibration; ≤1 was classified as deep sedation, which indicated that there was a response to pain stimulation; 0 was classified as general anesthesia, which indicated that there was a response to pain stimulation; 0 was classified as general anesthesia, which indicated that there was a response to pain stimulation. ≤1 is classified as deep sedation, indicating a response to painful stimuli; 0 is classified as general anesthesia, indicating no response to painful stimuli.

EEG feature extraction: use python MNE (https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) module package for analysis, MNE can read most common physiological signals in raw data format, the specific methods are as follows: ① Data extraction: import data → electrode positioning → reject useless electrodes → re-reference → filter → drop sampling rate → run ICA → batch processing → segmentation and baseline correction → interpolation of bad conductance and rejection of bad conductance → removal of noise components → rejection of bad segments; ② Data division: the data of the required EEG monitoring points are divided to include wakefulness and sedation; ③ Feature extraction: time domain, amplitude square root value, kurtosis, skewness, burst suppression rate/minute, frequency domain, and entropy index are obtained by Fourier transform.

OTHER,NCT04610879,"Changing Agendas on Sleep, Treatment and Learning in Epilepsy","Randomised Factorial Design Controlled Trial Comparing Carbamazepine, Levetiracetam or Active Monitoring Combined With or Without Sleep Behaviour Intervention in Treatment Naive Children With Rolandic Epilepsy","Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common type of epilepsy. Children with RE have seizures and can often find that their learning, sleep, behaviour, self-esteem and mood are affected.

As part of standard NHS care, children diagnosed with RE may be treated with standard anti-epileptic medicines, like carbamazepine, or no medicine at all. The medicines used to treat epilepsy often slow down a child's thinking and learning. In the past, doctors believed this was an acceptable price to pay to reduce seizures. However, with RE, where the seizures usually stop in teenage years, investigators do not know if it is better to treat these children with medicines or not, especially if the medicines might have a negative effect on their learning.

A newer medicine called levetiracetam has also been found to work in children with RE and has shown less problems with thinking and learning in adults. However, it is still no known if this is also the case for children and it has not been proven which of the three options (carbamazepine, levetiracetam or no treatment) would be best for RE patients. The CASTLE study aims to find this out.

In addition, it has been found that seizures often happen when a child has had poor sleep and they often come at night or early in the morning. It has been shown that sleep can be improved through practice without the need of medicines. There are established guidelines to help toddlers go to sleep, but nothing available that helps young people with epilepsy and their parents improve their sleep quality. In the CASTLE study, a sleep training plan has been developed for children with epilepsy and the trial aims to find out whether following this sleep training plan results in less seizures than using no sleep training at all.","The trial is a phase IV randomised factorial design controlled trial comparing carbamazepine, levetiracetam or active monitoring combined with or without sleep behaviour intervention. A factorial trial design has been used as this approach enables the efficient simultaneous investigation of AED (carbamazepine; levetiracetam; no AED) and sleep behaviour intervention (vs standard care) by including all participants in both analyses. In a factorial trial it is also possible to consider both the separate effects of each intervention and the benefits of receiving both interventions together (for example levetiracetam and sleep intervention).

The CASTLE trial will take place in NHS out-patient paediatric epilepsy and general paediatric clinics in the United Kingdom (UK).

Once consent has been obtained from the appropriate adult, and assent from the child if appropriate, by the delegated member of the research team the eligibility assessments will be completed, full eligibility confirmed (confirmation must be by a medically qualified doctor) and baseline data will be collected prior to randomisation.

Randomisation will be performed via a web based tool accessed by research team at site. This system is generated centrally by the Clinical Trial Research Centre (CTRC) using a computer algorithm concealed from the investigators and research teams/trial management group. In order to balance the groups, minimisation for variables believed to influence disease outcome and end points will be built into the randomisation algorithm.

Participants will be randomised to treatment with carbamazepine, levetiracetam or active monitoring. Where randomised to drug treatment, the randomised treatment should ideally begin on the day of randomisation or within 14 days of randomisation at the latest. Randomised treatment will continue for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 48 months. All treatments will be procured, prescribed and issued as per routine NHS practice.

Clinical data capture will be in the form of paper copies of Case Report Forms (CRFs) that will be returned as an on-going process from each centre to the CTRC. Patient/parent reported data will be collected directly on paper at each outpatient visit with the exception of CANTAB, which will be collected on iPads at the centre.

Objectives

Our primary study aim evaluates the immediate effect of CAP on agitation at 3 months. Our hypothesis is that PwD receiving CAP will manifest a lower caregiver rated frequency and severity score on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-(NPI) subscales of agitation+aggression (21 items), compared to those in the control intervention.

Three secondary aims are to evaluate: 1) effects of CAP at 6 months on agitation and quality of life in patients. Hypothesis: Patients receiving CAP will manifest lower caregiver rated frequency and severity scores on the NPI-C agitation + aggression subscales and better quality of life in comparison to patients receiving the control intervention from baseline to 6 months; 2) effects of CAP at 3 and 6 months on CG wellbeing, (burden, skill acquisition, efficacy using activities), and time spent providing care. Hypothesis: Caregivers receiving CAP will report enhanced wellbeing and less time caregiving compared to those in the control intervention at 3 and at 6 months; and 3) cost effectiveness of CAP expressed as an incremental cost outcome achieved in the form of CG burden reductions and willingness to pay for burden reductions at 3 and 6 months. Hypothesis: CAP will be cost effective compared to the control intervention at each test occasion.

To further understand treatment effects and enhance translation, we propose exploratory aims to evaluate: 1) Impact of CAP on psychotropic medication use in treatment and control conditions at 3 and 6 months by comparing proportion of PwD who require dose increases or incident use of psychotropic medications (negative outcome) and proportion of PwD who reduce or eliminate medication use because agitation improved (positive outcome); 2) Whether treatment effect on agitation differs at 3 and 6 months by cognitive status; 3) Whether CAP reduces total NPI scores as rated by CGs at 3 and 6 months, 4) If at 6-months CGs receiving CAP are using prescribed activities and with what frequency; and how CGs use any personal time gained; and 5) Extent to which treatment receipt and enactment (frequency/duration of sessions and use of activities) affects NPI-C scores. If proven efficacious and cost effective, CAP has potential to transform the current paradigm of dementia care that relies primarily on the pharmacologic management of agitation. It will offer clinicians and families a proven nonpharmacologic approach to enhance quality of life that can be replicated, has reimbursement potential, and resonates with medical treatment guidelines and health care reform efforts aimed at reducing pharmacologic use and helping older adults be cared for at home.

Background

This proposed trial specifically builds upon and extends the pilot phase testing of the proposed intervention with 60 dyads (NIMH R21 grant # R21 MH069425). This pilot phase evaluated program acceptability, identified behaviors most responsive, and evaluated magnitude of change for NPS and CG burden. Dyads were interviewed at baseline, randomized to intervention or wait-list control, and then reassessed at 4-months. After 4-months, the wait-list control group received the intervention and was reevaluated at 8 months (within group comparison 4 to 8 months). Main outcomes: At 4-months, a statistically significant treatment effect was found for frequency of NPS overall (p=.010; Cohen's d=.72) using the 16-item Agitated Behavior Inventory for dementia. Specifically, 77% of CGs in treatment reported improvements in NPS compared to 40% in the wait-list group; 23% in treatment reported worsening of NPS compared to 60% in wait-lists. As untreated agitation worsens over time in a significant proportion of patients, our pilot data suggests that worsened agitation was less common in the intervention group; the intervention also appeared to help reduce likelihood of worsening in patients whose agitation was destined to worsen without treatment. It appears unlikely that the intervention caused an adverse effect of worsening. However, as this is a possibility, it is listed in the consent form as a possible risk. Reductions for intervention group also occurred for specific behaviors reflecting agitation and behaviors of most concern to this CG sample; shadowing (p=.003, Cohen's d=3.10), and repetitive questioning (p=.023, Cohen's d=1.22), with slight increases (worsening) found for the control group. As shown in Figure 2, we also found a statistically significant reduction in prevalence of caregivers reporting agitation (p=.014, Cohen's d=.75); 14.8% in treatment vs. 44.8% in control reported PwD agitation at 4 months. A similar pattern was found for argumentation (p=.010, Cohen's d=.77). Also, CG in treatment reported that PwD demonstrated better engagement (p=.029, Cohen's d=.61), more pleasure (p=.045, Cohen's d=.690), and improved ability to keep positively busy (p=.017, Cohen's d=.71). Equally significant were reductions in CG objective burden as measured by NIH REACH vigilance items hours ""doing things"" for PwD (p=.005, Cohen's d=1.14); and hours ""on duty"" (p=.001, Cohen's d=1.01) with those in intervention reporting 5 hours less and those in control reporting spending 3 hours more on duty. Control group participants demonstrated similar benefits from 4 to 8 months. Medication Use: Of 60 PwD, 78.3% were on an anti-dementia medication (cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine), 32% were on psychotropic medication for NPS, and 45% were on antidepressants at study entry. Use of medications did not impact the primary outcome (e.g., frequency of behavioral symptoms). In separate regression analyses, we entered baseline use/non-use of 3 medication-types (e.g., anti-depressant, other psychotropic medication, and anti-dementia medications) as a predictor and found no impact on treatment outcome or effect size. This shows that medications are common, yet NPS persist. It also suggests the importance of assuring that PwD are on a stabilized dose prior to entering a trial so that treatment effects are not confounded by medication use. Cognitive Status: We found no difference in treatment effect by cognitive status: both high (\>10) and low (\< 10) MMSE groups benefited similarly with regard to the reduction of behavioral frequency. However, the high MMSE group also showed a reduction in the number of behaviors occurring at 4 months (p=.028). Cost: We also calculated preliminary incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), expressed as cost to bring about one additional unit of benefit measured by CG hours per day ""doing things"" and hours per day ""being on duty"" and decision tree and Monte Carlo analyses tested robustness of economic models. Average intervention cost was $941.63 per dyad. ICER showed that CGs in treatment saved one extra hour per day ""doing things"" at a cost of $2.37 per day; and one extra hour per day ""being on duty"" at a cost of $1.10 per day. Monte Carlo showed that the intervention was cost-effective 79.2% of the time for ""doing things"" and 79.6% of the time for ""being on duty."" Varying cost assumptions did not change cost-effectiveness. In summary, this pilot phase demonstrated proof of concept; high acceptability by PwD and CGs, preliminary positive outcomes, preliminary cost effectiveness, and that benefits were for PwD agitation and no adverse events. It also provides guidance for trial design considerations including importance of assuring dyads on medications have a stabilized dose prior to study enrollment and evaluating relationship of cognitive status to outcomes. Our proposed trial advances this pilot phase by: a) testing efficacy with a larger, diverse sample that will be well characterized as to diagnosis, disease severity, and behaviors using standard clinical assessments, b) comparing CAP to a control intervention condition receiving equivalent attention and social contact, controlling for unknown effects of empathy, validation and attention provided in CAP; c) examining cost effectiveness prospectively from a societal perspective, and d) evaluating a broad range of other outcomes and moderators (dose, intensity, activity use) to support future translational efforts.",COMPLETED,,2013-11,2017-11-23,2017-08-23,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,250,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Tailored Activity Program"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""TAP is designed to tap into spared or residual abilities and provide an environment supportive of these abilities.

It has been developed to standardize the process of vitrification and to increase the safety of the procedure. It has been demonstrated that the novel semiautomated, closed vitrification system providing standardized equilibration prior to cryopreservation can produce similar results in terms of recovery rate and Embryo development up to the blastocyst stage as compared to the commonly used Manual Cryotop® open vitrifcation system when applied in a mouse model.

Furthermore, its application has resulted in first pregnancies after transfer of vitrifiedwarmed biopsied human blastocyts. Due to limitations of the preliminary studies (application in mouse model; absence of a larger clinical Trial assessing pregnancy and live birth rates in human model etc.) it is of paramount importance to compare the GAVI® vitrification method to the routinely used Cryotop® method in a human IVF setting employing randomization and a-priori sample size definitions.

The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of vitrification using the semi-automated GAVI® closed system over the so-far routinely used manual Cryotop® open system in terms of post-thawing survival rate of 2PN oocytes.

The secondary objective of this trial is to study differences in embryo development, clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate and live birth rate.

Furthermore, differences in procedure duration and convenience will be evaluated.","One hundred and eighty (n=180) patients presenting more than 2 surplus 2 PNoocytes for vitrification or patients having all available 2PN oocytes electively vitrified will be randomly allocated (1:1) on day of fertilization check (day 1 after ovum pickup) to either procedure. In the study group, 2PN oocytes will be cryopreserved utilizing the semi-automated GAVI® open vitrification/warming technique.

In the control group, 2PN oocytes will be cryopreserved utilizing the manual Cryotop® open vitrification/warming technique.

The participation in this study will be limited to one cycle per patient. The study population consists of infertile couples undergoing IVF or ICSI treatment.

The study duration will be minimally 6 months per subject, e.g. the main study on the Primary outcome 2PN survival will be closed 6 months after randomization of the last patient.

Data from pregnancy and live birth outcome will be reported in addenda to the main clinical study report, as appropriate.

Before initiation of the study, all study sites will have investigators sufficiently trained.

The study will be performed in at least three sites within Germany. Patient recruitment will be competitive between study´centers.

The number of patients having oocyte pick-up during the time frame of the study conduct will consist of the population screened for inclusion.

In general, patients complying with the inclusion and exclusion criteria are eligible for inclusion and randomization.

There are no restrictions on the ovarian stimulation protocol and type or dose of ovulation induction agent (hCG or GnRH-agonist). Ovum pick-up is usually performed by transvaginal ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration 36±2 hours after hCG administration.

IVF or ICSI procedure is performed according to the investigator site´s standard operating procedure.

Fertilization check is performed on day 1 after ovum pick-up (OPU) 17±1 hours post insemination. The number of regularly fertilized oocytes, defined as oocyte presenting 2 pronuclei and 2 polar bodies, is assessed.

Patients presenting ≥ 2 surplus regularly fertilized oocytes for cryoperservation on day 1 and patients undergoing elective cryopreservation of all available 2 PN oocytes are are allocated to one of the two 2 procedures.

Randomization will be performed on day of fertilization check (day 1 after OPU) by lab staff by opening a numbered, opaque sealed envelopes. The random sequence will be software-generated and blocks will be used. All randomized patients will be logged in a paper- based randomization log with initials, DOB, study number, date, study group, name and signature of staff. Randomization will be stratified by Center and by indication (surplus 2PN oocyte cryopreservation vs. elective cryopreservation of all available 2PN oocytes).

All vitrification and warming procedures will be performed according to the manufacturer´s instructions.

In order to investigate the differences in vitrification procedure duration, the time span between starting with preparations needed for vitrification and transferring the vitrification device(s) into the liquid nitrogen tank for storage will be recorded.

Depending on the investigator site's cryo embryo transfer policy, in a subsequent natural or programmed cycle vitrified/warmed embryos will be replaced. Within site, all patients will undergo the same cryoprotocol for preparation of the endometrium.

There are no specifications on the protocol to be used. The number of 2 PN oocytes to be warmed will be decided by the investigator on a case by case basis. Embryo culture will be performed in all cases in individual microdroplets covered with culture oil up to the day of scheduled embryo transfer.

The day of embryo transfer and the number of embryos to be transferred will be decided by the investigator on a case by case basis.

In order to investigate survival rate, warmed 2PN-ooytes will be assessed immediately and 2 hours post warming procedure. Survival will be confirmed by the presence of an intact oolemma and regular cytoplasm 2 hours after the warming procedure and/or when embryonic cleavage is observed.

In order to investigate potential differences in development and quality of vitrified/warmed embryos cleavage and morphology will be assessed as followed:

day 2 (44±1 hours post insemination) : cell number, blastomere size, grade of fragmentation

The primary objective of this study is to determine if the addition of pembrolizumab to blinatumomab improves the Complete Response Rate (CR) and Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh) relative to blinatumomab alone in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with high bone marrow lymphoblast percentage (\>50% lymphoblasts).,"This is a Phase I/II study of blinatumomab in combination with pembrolizumab in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-lineage ALL (B-ALL). The primary objective of this study is to determine if the addition of pembrolizumab to blinatumomab improves the Complete Response Rate (CR) and Complete Remission with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh) relative to blinatumomab alone in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with high bone marrow lymphoblast percentage (\>50% lymphoblasts).

Mechanisms of resistance to blinatumomab are not well understood although inhibition of or suboptimal T-cell activation may play an important role. Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Programmed Death-Ligand 2 (PD-L2) expression and upregulation in lymphoblasts and the bone marrow microenvironment at baseline and in response to cytokines including those released upon blinatumomab exposure may inhibit T-cell function through the Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) receptor and lead to resistance to blinatumomab. The investigators hypothesize that part of the resistance to therapy with blinatumomab is mediated by the exuberant cytokine release seen with higher disease burden leading to increased expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Enhancing T-cell activity through use of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is predicted to augment the activity of blinatumomab and convert more patients to complete remission and prolong remission durations. This study will also act to expand knowledge of PD-L1 and PD-L2 dynamics in response to blinatumomab. It will also be a paradigm for the addition of checkpoint inhibitors to therapy with bifunctional T-cell engaging antibodies currently in development for targeting other liquid and solid tumors.

The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4/kappa) isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.

The study will be conducted in 2 stages:

Stage 1 is to ensure safety of pembrolizumab in combination with blinatumomab.

It is considered to be the most fatal and aggressive primary cardiac malignancy. This international registry aims to establish a large multicenter database of patients with cardiac angiosarcoma. Our objectives are:

1. Collect clinical data, including demographics, medical history, treatments, and outcomes, to build a comprehensive database.
2. Analyze data to evaluate and identify genetic, environmental, or lifestyle risk factors for cardiac angiosarcoma.
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of various treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation) to inform best practices.
4. Develop evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management based on registry data.","Primary cardiac angiosarcoma arises directly within the heart, unlike secondary cardiac tumors that originate from elsewhere in the body. While it predominantly affects the right side of the heart, particularly the right atrium, it can also impact other cardiac chambers and structures. The characteristic feature of cardiac angiosarcoma is the rapid formation of abnormal blood vessels that invade the myocardium, leading to the destruction of healthy heart tissue.The five-year survival rate for patients with primary cardiac angiosarcoma (PCA) is reported to be around 14%. In contrast, familial variants of this malignancy exhibit even more severe outcomes, with a mean survival rate of only 4 months.

Establishing an international registry for cardiac angiosarcomas is crucial for several reasons:

* The registry will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the clinical characteristics, treatment responses, and outcomes associated with cardiac angiosarcoma. By collecting data from diverse populations, researchers can identify patterns and factors that influence survival rates. It is crucial to better understand the growth rates and risk factors associated with cardiac angiosarcoma and to make the disease more manageable.
* The international registry will enable the latest advancements in oncology and related medical fields to be incorporated into clinical practice. It will provide a platform for developing and conducting clinical trials aimed at improving treatment strategies and increasing survival rates for patients with cardiac angiosarcoma.
* Finally, with data from various institutions and countries, the registry will promote collaboration among healthcare professionals, researchers, and institutions dedicated to improving outcomes for patients with this rare malignancy.

Creating an international registry for cardiac angiosarcoma is crucial for better understanding this aggressive cancer. It will help address the rising cancer burden and support research and treatment advancements that could improve patient survival rates and prevention.

These processes include adhesion of the blastocyst to the endometrial surface \& trophoblastic differentiation \& invasion.

A recent Cochrane review hinted towards research to study the possible effects of the local (uterine), \& NOT SYSTEMIC application of heparin during Assisted reproductive technology (ART). Based on the above evidence the investigators hypothesize that low molecular weight heparin given intrauterine at mock embryo transfer after oocyte pick up will help improve pregnancy rates in patients undergoing ART.","Following ethical approval of the committee of Egyptian IVF-ET center, a pilot prospective randomized controlled study will include 40 patients, in which the study arm (group A ) will be injected with LMWH intrauterine during mock embryo transfer, just after ovum pickup, while the control arm (group B) will be injected intrauterine with similar volume tissue culture media (G.2 plus ref. 10132, Vitrolife) also after ovum pickup. Admission into either group will be through randomization after inclusion \& exclusion criteria have been met and before start of controlled ovarian stimulation protocol.

The standard long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist protocol will be used for patients with predicted normal response based on clinical \& hormonal profile ; 1 mg of leuprolide acetate daily s.c injection (Lucrin ®; Abbott, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) is applied from the mid luteal phase onward till the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) injection.

Gonadotropins in the form of human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) (Merional ®, IBSA, Institut Biochimique SA, Lugano, Switzerland) will be given by intramuscular injection (IM) from the 2nd day of menstruation, The starting dose range from 150 to 450 IU depending on the basal follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level, Antral follicle count (AFC) , Patient's age and body mass index (BMI).

In all protocols, stimulation is monitored by trans vaginal ultrasonography and serial estradiol (E2) measurements starting from day 7 of the cycle and the gonadotropin dose is adjusted individually according to follicular response.

After the development of at least three leading follicles≥18 mm, 10,000 unit of HCG (Choriomon, IBSA, Institut Biochimique SA) is given IM, and a trans-vaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is performed 36 hours later.

After scheduled oocyte pick up, a mock embryo transfer will be done using labotec catheter (Labotec, Gottingen Germany), and an injection of Enaoxaprin sodium (LMWH) (Clexane® Sanofi S.A Paris, France) will be given intrauterine in group A patients.

LMWH is safe in pregnancy, category B drug , and given empirically sometimes in luteal phase and in early 1st trimester without reported problems, it has a half life of 4 Hours, and therefore it should not have any negative effects on developing embryos as it will not be present at the time of transfer while already performing it s desired effect on the endometrium.

The dose of LMWH given was calculated comparatively according to the work done by our group Mansour et.al, 2011, where intrauterine administration 500 IU of HCG improved the implantation and pregnancy rates.

Given the fact that this has not been attempted before, the best way to compare two different drugs is through biological activity. So if the investigators want to use 500 IU of LMWH, and knowing that In the in vitro purified system, enoxaparin sodium has a high anti Xa activity (approximately 100 IU/mg), so to get 500 IU of LMWH we need 5mg. Clexane 20mg is packed in a 0.2ml syringe, And therefore the investigators need to inject 0.05ml intrauterine using labotec catheter. (1/4 OF THE ORIGINAL SYRINGES CONTENT..i.e 5mg).

The control arm (group B) will be injected intrauterine with similar volume of tissue culture media (G.2 plus ref. 10132, Vitrolife) Oocytes are then fertilized in vitro using ICSI and after three to five days embryo transfer will be done using labotec catheter (Labotec, Gottingen Germany) with ultrasound guidance.

Progesterone pessaries 400 mg twice daily (Cyclogest 400mg ®Actavis plc. Dublin, Ireland) is given as a luteal support starting from the day of embryo transfer and continued for 16 days after.

Pregnancy is defined as the occurrence of a positive β-HCG \>10 IU on day 12 after embryo transfer and a second higher value 2 days later, followed by ultrasonography confirmation of cardiac activity at 6 weeks gestation

A third party not involved in the actual study will moniter progress of the results and record them. Study will be stopped if more than 10 consecutive patients fail to get pregnant in the LMWH group.

Midwives should take psychological approaches in order to reduce the negative feelings of women before cesarean section. Considering all these, it is thought that Emotional Freedom Technique, which does not require any invasive intervention, is inexpensive and easy to apply, will contribute to women's feeling better by reducing pre-cesarean anxiety, surgical fear and traumatic birth perception.","Although childbirth is a normal physiological event for the female body, it causes stress for the woman and brings with it many risks. Cesarean section, which is one of the birth types; It is a surgical procedure that enables delivery to occur through an incision made on the abdominal wall and uterus of the mother. Although the cesarean rate recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) is 15%, the rate of cesarean section in our country is 52.1% according to the Turkey Demographic and Health Survey.

Every surgical procedure to be performed, the decision of surgery and the waiting period may cause anxiety in individuals. Anxiety and fear experienced before surgery; It can cause individuals to experience uneasiness, restlessness and dissatisfaction due to the uncertainty they are in. Preoperative pain, fear of death, the thought that the body will be harmed and suffering, fear of losing consciousness and control due to anesthesia, and the uncertainty associated with anesthesia may cause fear of surgery. Anxiety before cesarean section is multifaceted, and it has been reported that the pregnancy process increases anxiety. In studies, it was determined that the anxiety level of mothers before cesarean section was high. The extreme degree of anxiety and fear plays a very important role in the formation of traumatic perception towards birth.

Many methods are used to reduce negative emotions in the prenatal period. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), which is one of these methods, is a method used to resolve emotional blockages in the energy body of the person. EFT aims to reveal all the points where there is a possibility of negative emotion experienced in the past and stuck in a part of the body. By focusing on the emotions that negatively affect the person in EFT, the energy flow is regulated with stimulations often made by touch. When administered to pregnant women, it may contribute to a decrease in post-traumatic stress disorder and to reduce the level of anxiety and fear.

For inoperable patients or residual tumor after surgery, standard of care would be palliative chemotherapy. For a small subset of patients (good performance status, small radiation fields) re-irradiation can be performed. In this study the established concept of re-irradiation with photons will be transferred to proton radiotherapy. Proton therapy has the advantage of a steeper dose gradient to normal tissues, thus-theoretical advantages for lower toxicity.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary: Evaluation of late toxicity of re-irradiation with protons, for patients with head and neck cancer in a previously (\> 50 Gy) irradiated field.

Secondary: Evaluation of the efficacy (local control) and acute toxicity (after 24 Months) of re-irradiation with protons up to a dose of 60 Gy, for patients with head and neck cancer in a previously (\> 50 Gy) irradiated field.

OUTLINE This is a single center observational study. In-house standard of care for patients (good performance status and with small tumors) with head and neck cancer in a previously (\> 50 Gy) irradiated field is to irradiate the tumor with a hyperfractionated schedule and concurrent cisplatin up to a dose of 66 Gy.

However, many cancers can hide from white blood cells making white blood cells less effective in killing tumors. In this study the investigators plan to boost the activity of patients white blood cell by making tumor cells more visible to the white blood cells. This will be done by injecting antibodies and a new drug that together can make white blood cells inside tumors more active. The investigators plan to recruit sixteen people with advanced lung cancer to make sure that this treatment, which has not been done in any humans, is safe and well tolerated.","This is a phase 1b, a first-in-humans, study to examine the safety and feasibility of administration of intratumor (IT) IVIG + poly-ICLC (Hiltonoll®), and intramuscular (IM) poly-ICLC (Hiltonoll®) for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Veterans without targetable mutations. The investigators will employ the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design 1, with dose escalation, de-escalation endpoints to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in IT injections (IVIG + poly-ICLC) and IM poly-ICLC in 16 subjects while receiving front line Immune Checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as the standard of care (SOC). All patients continue to receive ICIs. If safe, a future phase II randomized-controlled study will be designed to determine if treatment with IT injections (IVIG + poly-ICLC) and IM injections (poly-ICLC) results in improved progression free survival.

Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and determine the MTD as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 6 (CTCAE v. 6) of IT injection of IVIG + poly-ICLC, and IM poly-ICLC given in combination with ICI in Veterans with stage IV NSCLC.

Secondary Objective: To quantitate systemic and tissue-specific immune responses in patients who receive intertumoral IVIG + poly-ICLC, and IM poly-ICLC while receiving ICIs.

Primary Endpoint: Assessment of an MTD dose for IT injection of IVIG + poly-ICLC, and IM injection of poly-ICLC given in combination with ICI in patients with stage IV NSCLC. The primary safety endpoint includes short term and long-term dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and observing less than 25% grade 3 toxicity.

Secondary Objectives: To investigate familial aggregation of prostate cancer in blacks and whites. To determine whether screening behavior differs in men diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer versus those with later stage disease as well as to determine if screening behavior differences exist between blacks and whites.

Primary Outcomes: The primary outcomes are pesticide, occupational and chemical exposure, and dietary history. Other major endpoints include: 1) familial aggregation of prostate cancer; 2) weight, weight history, and weight cycling; 3) subject's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about prostate cancer; and 4) treatment choices.

Intervention: N/A

Study Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men. Among African Americans the incidence and mortality from prostate cancer is even greater. Although incidence rates in the Southern United States tend to be only slightly higher than that of the nation, a clear discrepancy exists between national mortality rates and those in the Southeastern United States. Notably high rates, particularly among African Americans are observed and in North Carolina the prostate cancer mortality rate among African Americans is the highest of any state in the nation. In spite of these statistics, very little is known about racially based differences in the etiology of this disease.

This study hypothesizes that racial differences in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer may be a result of multiple factors including those that are socioeconomic, environmental, dietary and genetic. This research will provide insight into gene-environmental interactions that initiate and promote prostatic neoplasia as well as address whether there are differences in patterns of care which impact morbidity and survival. The results of this study will also be compared to findings in non-veterans that are being generated through an NCI-funded sister study of these issues under the direction of co-investigator, Dr. JoEllen Schildkraut of Duke University.

Subjects are identified from pathology reports extracted from VISTA. It has been determined that pathology reports alone are not a sufficient source of identifying cases because not all patients coming to VA for treatment have diagnostic pathology completed at the Durham VA. Therefore, we have added additional protocols for subject identification such as reviewing radiation/oncology clinic records for those subjects referred for radiation treatment. To-date, 78 cases and 66 controls have been enrolled in the study. To increase accrual rates, in-home visits have been used when necessary, and the Richmond, VA and Asheville, NC VAMCs have been added as participating study sites. Due to patient accrual problems and project staffing changes, the Durham ERIC has granted this study a six-month, no-cost extension through 7/31/2001.",COMPLETED,,1998-02,,,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,0,,[],,,1
OTHER,NCT00553579,The Relationship of Residence Time and Visual Effect of Optive and Systane in Dry Eye Subjects,The Relationship of Residence Time and Visual Effect of Optive and Systane in Dry Eye Subjects,"The benefits of artificial tears to relieve dry eye symptoms include, but are not limited to: stabilizing the tear film layer, fluid supplement action, improving visual acuity, and comfort. Studies have found a relationship between some of these benefits. For example, stabilization of the tear film is important not only to increase the tear break up time (TBUT), but is key in improving and maintaining visual acuity. These studies have alluded to the fact that there may or may not be a relationship between residence time and visual performance. Viscosity is one reason behind the uncertainty. Some solutions contain polymers which influence the ocular surface when contacted. This can impact residence time and ultimately visual performance. No prior research has explored the direct relationship between residence time and visual performance.

Residence time refers to the duration at which the artificial tear resides on the eye. Methods have been developed to assess residence time by admixing fluorescent tracers to the solution and then measuring the amount of fluorescence over time. The caveat to methods using certain tracers has lead to uncertainty in elimination measurements due to corneal penetration or differing molecular weights (MW) from the active vehicle ingredient in the solution. For example, low-MW tracers can be eliminated at a different rate than higher-MW polymers. In addition, the low-MW tracers may be able to penetrate the corneal epithelium giving a false pre-corneal residence time. Meadows, Paugh, Joshi, and Mordaunt addressed this issue by developing a technique using a polymer which did not penetrate the cornea and had the same MW as the active ingredient in the solution FITC-dextran. Based on the assumption that similar weights are eliminated at the same rate, this technique has shown to be more economic, manageable, and amendable than previous procedures measuring residence time.

Any ophthalmic drop has the potential to impact visual acuity upon instillation due to the effect it has on the tear layer components. Studies have observed that taking artificial tears continuously over time tends to stabilize the tear layer thus minimizing the immediate drop in contrast sensitivity upon instillation. Measuring the visual effect of artificial tears, using contrast sensitivity as a measure, provides valuable information about the therapeutic effect of artificial tears that are meant to stabilize the tear film, thus improving visual acuity in dry eye patients.

But what about the patient? There is a difference between residence time and retention of effect- which is often what matters the most for patients. Retention of effect refers to the beneficial effect of the drop. Currently there is no real measure of retention of effect. Doctors can assess the tear film objectively, but there have been no strong correlations between subjective dry symptoms and tear film stability. A possible reason for the lack of correlation may be due to the fact that subjectivity is difficult to quantify. However, scales like the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) have been established in an attempt to quantify subjective experiences such as visual quality. We will be using the NRS to gauge the comfort of the drop upon the initial application to get a general idea of the comfort the drop provides to the user.

Although there have been several studies done on residence time and visual effect of ophthalmic formulations separately, there is no current research correlating these two aspects of therapeutic efficacy. This study will be the first to concurrently investigate residence time (using FITC-dextran) and visual effect of an ophthalmic formulation.",,COMPLETED,,2007-06,2008-05,2008-05,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,18,ESTIMATED,[],,,1

It is a small device, easy to use, and suitable for home measurements as well as hospital settings. When used correctly, the measurements cause no discomfort and can be performed repeatedly. The Eforto® device connects to a smartphone application that provides verbal test instructions to the participant. The app will guide the participant during the test and automatically provide motivational cues via audio. The test results are aggregated and stored in a cloud platform where the researcher can manage subjects, access the test data and export it for further analysis.
2. Mobile application that ensures connectivity and collection of data from the Eforto® device and by which multiple guided tests for the locomotor (maximal grip strength, respiratory muscle strength, muscle fatigue resistance test \& self-perceived fatigue questionnaire), sensory (hearing test (signal to noise technology) \& vision test (rotating E test), cognitive (orientation test, object naming from description, animal naming \& 10-words immediate and delayed recall), and psychological (resilience questionnaire) domains of intrinsic capacity can be completed. The app allows offline data collection and to synchronize with the third component, the remote monitoring platform. It serves as an interactive guidance and can be used by the subject/patient at home or assisted by a (formal or informal) caregiver.
3. The remote monitoring platform serves mainly as a dashboard for monitoring the older end-users. Its main purpose is to centralize and monitor the collected data.

Procedures:

The study will be approved by the institutional review board's and all participants will sign informed consent.

After informed consent is given, the eligibility assessment and T0 (baseline) measurements will take place. These measurements will be re-assessed after 2 months and 4 months.

During this test moments the participant will be asked to perform the ISHA-tests (intrinsic domains: vitality, locomotor, sensory, cognitive and psychological). Other tests that will be assessed are: anthropometry (body weight \& height and waist \& hip circumference), health status (medical history, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), fall incidents, hospital admissions, Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and orthostatic test), Frailty (Fried Criteria), functional dependency tests (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), basic activity of daily living (ADL) (Katz), instrumental ADL (Lawton) and Short Physical Performance Test (SPPB)), questionnaires (Sarcopenia Quality of life questionnaire (SarQol), Eq-5D-5L, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), health-economic questionnaire and general health questions) and technical problem/ usability, feasibility and expectations questionnaires. In the context of eligible check, the smartphone experiences and personal data e.g. sex, birth day date, living situation will be asked.

After an individual information session with training on the ISHA test battery and instructions for ISHA use in self-test mode, the participant will be instructed to perform the ISHA measurements for 4 months at their home (if needed with assistance by an (in)formal caregiver). Preferentially, the healthcare professional (occupational therapist, physical therapist, study nurse) will install the ISHA application on the smartphone of the participant. If during the individual information session, the participant is unable to correctly operate the ISHA tool, the healthcare professional will explore together with the participant whether a (informal or formal) caregiver could aid, and eventually the participant will be re-invited together with his/her informal caregiver for another information/training session. If correct use of the ISHA system by the participant and/or assistance by a caregiver is impossible, the participant will be excluded for further participation in the study.

The self-test measurements will be continued for 4 months or until withdrawal of the participant. The self-tests will be performed:

* weekly on 2 consecutive days per week for vitality capacity;
* once every two weeks for locomotor capacity, and
* once every month for sensory, cognitive, and psychological capacity.

The application will give a reminder to the participant every time he/she needs to do the ISHA measurements.

During the study, participants will be contacted every month by a researcher to register any changes in health situation as well as technical issues encountered during the self-testing.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-04-01,2025-04-01,2025-04-01,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,120,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""ISHA"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Participants will be provided with an Eforto® device and ISHA mobile application to self-monitor intrinsic capacity for 4 months (if needed with assistance by an (in)formal caregiver)."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE,isha,0
INDUSTRY,NCT02558179,Diagnosing Bacterial Vaginosis/Vaginitis (BV) Using the Gynecologene Test Method,Prospective Multicenter Cross Sectional Study of the American International Biotechnology (AIBiotech) Gynecologene Test for the Evaluation of Bacterial Vaginosis/Vaginitis in Symptomatic Women,"This study is designed as a prospective evaluation of the diagnostic performance of the multiplex nucleic acid-based genetic test (Gynecologene Next-Generation Sequencing test) to identify known significant causative organisms in bacterial vaginosis/vaginitis and other major pathogens and normal commensals in symptomatic women during the reproductive years. Vaginal fluid samples will be split and tested with the comparator methods and Nugent score, with the results evaluated according to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Laboratorians performing each test will be blinded to the clinical history and any prior test results to minimize ascertainment bias.

Each subject will be followed routinely for up to 6 weeks after initial visit for vaginosis/vaginitis by telephone or office visit at the discretion of the treating physician.","Bacterial vaginosis (BV, or vaginal bacteriosis) and vaginitis are the most common vaginal infections of women during the child-bearing years, with BV alone accounting for 27-41% 1 prevalence in Americans. BV is characterized by replacement of the healthy lactobacillus-dominant microbiome by a diverse polymicrobial overgrowth of multiple taxa of commensal facultative anaerobes and other pathogenic bacteria. Molecular-based phylogenetic analyses, including the newly-completed Human Microbiome Project and other next-generations sequencing (NGS) studies, revealed the complexity of the vaginal microbiome in health and disease. BV does not appear to be a single entity, but rather consists of multiple bacterial community clusters. Clusters are dominated by Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, or anaerobic combinations with or without Lactobacillus spp. (species) in varying proportions. In addition, multiple significant BV-associated pathogens were discovered that had escaped notice with other detection methods such as cultures; previously overlooked were Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners and other Lactobacillus spp., and multiple Lachnospiraceae spp (Bacterial Vaginosis Associated 1, Bacterial Vaginosis Associated 2, and Bacterial Vaginosis Associated 3; BVA1, BVA2 and BVA 3 respectively). This multisite study proposes to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Gynecologene Next-Generation Sequencing test in women with symptoms of vaginitis/vaginosis. To the investigators' knowledge, the Gynecologene is the first commercially-available comprehensive NGS-based laboratory-developed test available to assist with diagnosis and clinical management of BV.

This multisite site study compares the diagnostic performance of the Gynecologene Next-Generation Sequencing test with the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis/vaginitis (Nugent score). The second objective is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Gynecologene Score with the Nugent Score for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis/vaginitis. The third objective is to identify the prevalence and diagnostic thresholds of bacterial loads with the Gynecologene test.

Women between 18-55 years of age will be eligible for this study when diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis or vaginitis confirmed using the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) diagnostic gold standard of Nugent score; Amsel criteria will also be recorded. Other inclusion as well as exclusion criteria exist. A minimum of 5 geographically different sites will be enrolled in the study. Co-investigators will follow the protocol to enroll participants and collect 2 vaginal swabs and 1 slide smear. The patient has no financial gain nor responsibility within this protocol.

Overall, the study will have 90% power at a significance level of 0.05 to detect ± 5% positive percent agreement of the study device with the predicate device. To achieve this level of power, 100 total samples will be assayed per group to account for withdrawals and treatment failures. Samples that contain more than one targeted organism can be counted twice as the analyses for each organism are independent of each other. The provision of treatment, including type, dose, and duration, is solely at the discretion of the clinician according to his/her current routine procedures to reflect typical contemporary practice.

AIBiotech will serve as a central medical diagnostic laboratory for this trial. Results of all analytical tests will be provided to the Principal Investigator.

Data for analysis will be blinded for patient identification and other PHI (protected health information) by the study administrator. Data will be analyzed and reported.",UNKNOWN,,2015-09,2018-07,2017-03,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,300,ESTIMATED,[],,,0
OTHER,NCT01159379,Safety of Ertapenem in Beta-lactam Allergic Patients.,Cross-reactivity and Tolerability of Ertapenem in Patients With IgE-mediated Allergy to Beta-lactams,The purpose of this study is to assess cross-reactivity and tolerability of ertapenem in patients with IgE-mediated allergy to at least one beta-lactam molecule.,"Ertapenem is a new carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase which has a broad antibacterial activity. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action and it has a long half-life of 4.5 hours; for this reason it can be developed as a single daily dose carbapenem.

In literature, no cases of IgE-mediated allergy to ertapenem have been described until now. However, a single study put in evidence a 47% rate of cross-reactivity between imipenem-cilastatin and beta-lactams in a group of patients affected by IgE-mediated allergy to these drugs. For this reason carbapenem administration to beta-lactam allergic patients has always been considered potentially harmful. Other studies reported lower cross-reactivity rates (from 7 to 11%) between imipenem-cilastatin and beta-lactams but patients of these studies did not undergo any allergy testing in order to demonstrate the pathogenesis of the reactions.

Recent studies put in evidence that imipenem has a very low cross-reactivity rate with other beta-lactams and they have a very good tolerability among patients with IgE-mediated allergy to beta-lactams: Romano et al. found a cross-reactivity rate of 0.9% between imipenem and penicillins in 112 penicillin-allergic patients (mean age 44.56 ± 15.66 ys.); Atanasković-Marković et al. found a cross-reactivity rate of 0.8% in 124 paediatric patients (age range 3-14 ys.) between imipenem and penicillins. In both groups imipenem was well tolerated by patients with negative allergy testing.

Meropenem showed to have a good tolerability too in penicillin allergic patients: Romano et al. found a cross-reactivity rate of 0.9% between penicillins and meropenem in penicillin-allergic patients (mean age 47.83 ± 15.8); Atanasković-Marković et al. found a cross-reactivity rate of 0.8% in 109 paediatric patients (age range 3-14 ys.) between meropenem and penicillins. In both groups meropenem was well tolerated by patients with negative allergy testing.

No data regarding the cross-reactivity of ertapenem with other beta-lactams and its tolerability among patients with IgE-mediated allergy beta-lactams are available in literature.

Aim of the study On the basis of those data, we decided to investigate the cross-reactivity of ertapenem with other beta-lactams in patients suffering from IgE-mediated allergy to at least one beta-lactam molecule and its tolerability in a group of a patients with negative allergy testing with ertapenem.",UNKNOWN,,2011-01,2011-12,2011-09,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,,30,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""ertapenem"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""intravenous, 1 gram, once"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,ertapenem,0

OTHER,NCT00228579,Assessment of Changes in Abdominal Fat,Assessment of Changes in Abdominal Fat and Metabolic and Tissue Biomarkers During a Bariatric Surgery Weight Loss Intervention Program,"In this study, we propose to determine the effect of weight loss on amount of body fat, and on body fat distribution, in severely obese patients. We also want to determine what measurements (waist, hip or thigh circumference) best show the changes in body fat and fat distribution in this group. Most importantly, we want to relate the changes in body measurements to changes in health indicators (blood cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugars, liver function). With the findings of this study, clinicians should be able to predict an improvement in health based on a change in waist, hip or thigh size. Because this is a pilot study, we will focus on women, who make up the bulk of our clinic population. We will also focus on racial differences between Caucasians and Blacks.","Severe obesity affects 4.7% of the U.S. population. A significant number of these individuals suffer from impaired glucose tolerance and type II diabetes due to insulin resistance (IR). Although it is generally accepted that the accumulation of intraabdominal (IA) fat increases the risk of developing IR, the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are not yet understood. In addition, the role of subcutaneous (SC) fat towards the etiology of IR - protective, inert or detrimental - is still under debate. This is because SC adipose tissue releases adipocytokines (IL-6, leptin, TNF-a) that have been demonstrated to impair insulin action. In individuals who are severely obese, hyperinsulinemia may induce an exaggerated production of adipocytokines from IA compared to SC fat stores. Our specific aims are: (1) to determine relative contribution of abdominal SC fat versus IA fat to systemic levels of IL-6, leptin and TNF-a in lean and in severely obese individuals; (2) to determine the effects of systemic adipocytokine concentrations on whole body as well as tissue sensitivity to insulin. Hypothesis: (a) In the context of severe obesity, IA fat produces increased quantities of IL-6, leptin and TNF-a compared to SC fat; (b) In severely obese patients undergoing weight loss, whole body and tissue IR can be predicted by changes in systemic adipocytokines. Methods: Adipose tissue content of IL-6, leptin and TNF-a will be determined by ELISA in biopsies obtained from IA and SC fat stores in lean and severely obese patients. Computer tomography-determined areas of IA and SC fat will be related to changes in systemic adipocytokines at baseline and 6-mo following weight loss therapy. Changes in systemic IL-6, leptin and TNF-a will be assessed from measurements made at baseline and following 6-mo weight loss. For this time period we will also determine changes in whole body (via IVGTT) and tissue sensitivity to insulin (via glucose uptake into muscle and fat). Relationships between systemic adipocytokines and IR will be assessed using uni- and multivariate correlation analysis. These novel studies will determine whether hypersecretion of adipocytokines by IA versus SC adipose tissue induces IR in patients with severe obesity.",COMPLETED,,2003-06,2020-12,2020-12,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,60,ESTIMATED,[],,,1

Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse.The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse.,"Background: Intimate partner abuse is very common among university students. Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse. An intervention with evidence-based applications to post-traumatic stress caused by intimate partner abuse and posttraumatic growth, using web-based applications that young people are familiar with, is considered important in order to protect the physical-mental health of university students, to increase their academic success, and to ensure that they establish healthy intimate partner relationships in the future.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse.

Methods: The randomized controlled study that did not use blinding employed a 2x5 split-plot design. The universe of the study consisted of 371 student nurses. Students who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: experimental (n=17) and control (n=18). The internet-based psychosocial intervention, which was based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, was delivered individually and electronically to the students in the experimental group in eight sessions, each lasting up to 120 minutes, using videoconferencing. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PGTI) were used to measure the outcomes at the pre-test, post-test, 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up.

Discussion: The internet-based psychosocial intervention was found to be effective in reducing post-traumatic stress and experiencing post-traumatic growth in student nurses who had been exposed to partner violence with these positive effects lasting for six months. This study is one of the first web-based randomized controlled studies to address post-traumatic stress and growth together in university students who were exposed to intimate partner violence. It is hoped that the results of the study will guide the research to be carried out in this context by internet intervention in the future.

OTHER,NCT04787679,Image-guided Computational and Experimental Analyses of Fractured Patient's Bone (GAP),Image-guided Computational and Experimental Analyses of Fractured Patient's Bone (GAP),"Due to the increase in the average age of the population, the projections on the number of age-dependent bone fractures appear to be constantly increasing.

They are mainly due to bone pathologies, including osteoporosis. The latter leads to a reduction in bone mineral density and deterioration of the micro-architecture, with a consequent increase in bone fragility. However, the mechanisms of damage at the micro-scale have not yet been elucidated and there is no universally recognized damage criterion. Recent research has evaluated the importance of implementing computational models to study the influence of bone gaps, canaliculi and microporosities on the propagation of damage. These models need to be validated through experimental tests, still lacking, in particular on human bones, in the current scientific landscape. Once the experimental validation of computational models has been developed, it will be possible to introduce new fracture indices at the micro-scale, useful for a preventive diagnosis of osteoporosis.","The study of the mechanisms of bone damage, which occur at the multiscale, is of fundamental importance for the understanding of fracture processes. In particular, age-related fractures are continuously increasing due to the increase in average age and widespread diseases such as osteoporosis. They result in high economic burdens, morbidity (including psychological, e.g., frailty), and increased mortality. In order to reduce the impact of bone fractures on health and economy, early diagnosis is the key. In this context, one must consider that bone is characterized by a complex hierarchical structure. Both the cortical and trabecular sections consist of micrometric lamellae, composed of collagen fibrils, within which osteocytes are found. They reside in sub-micrometer cavities called lacunae, which are connected by a dense network of canaliculi. At the nanoscale, the fibrils consist primarily of collagen and hydroxyapatite crystals. This complex architecture is reflected in fracture patterns: damage, in fact, occurs at the multiscale. However, fracture patterns and their associated physical phenomena are still not understood, especially at the microscale.

Recently, microscale imaging techniques have been combined with subject-specific numerical models, which are able to calculate local values of bone stress and strain. Preliminary studies have focused on evaluating a possible interaction between micro-cracks and microstructural porosity. This particular research focuses on the lacunar network, which is presumed to significantly affect bone resistance to fracture although the actual role of the lacunar network is not yet elucidated. First, lacunae are areas of stress concentration, which apparently lead to weakening of the bone structure. However, in most cases, the lacunae make a positive contribution to toughness by deflecting the crack front. The connection between the lacunae, determined by the network of canaliculi, is also reduced in osteoporotic subjects, preventing the slowing of damage. In this sense, bone can be considered a damage tolerant material. Donaldson et al developed computational models and estimated a threshold for microdamage initiation and propagation. They used computerized micro-tomography of murine femurs and evaluated the influence of different algorithms on the propagation of in-silico damage. Further results showed that the damage always occurs on the surfaces of blood vessels or porosities and does not instead start from the lacunae. However, further simulations and models would be needed to verify the effectiveness of the damage models.

Computational damage models also require experimental validation. Preliminary studies have been conducted in two main directions: in-vivo imaging and image-guided failure assessment (IGFA) techniques. The first approach allows nondestructive monitoring of bone damage in living animals. The second approach, implemented by A. Levchuk et al. (8), shows enormous potential by allowing the study of microcrack initiation and propagation with sub-micrometer resolution, but only on small animals.

The current research for the first time wants to perform tests on human bone samples applying IGFA techniques.

Despite several studies on the characterization of damage models at the micro-scale, a validation of computational models of fracture on human subjects is still lacking. In addition, the role of morphological features at the micro-scale in samples is still unknown.

These micro-scale studies could improve clinical understanding of bone fracture and prediction of fracture risk. Currently, clinicians use bone mineral density, which is a macro-scale parameter, as the most common predictor of bone fracture. However, recent studies demonstrate the importance of a thorough characterization of the geometric and morphologic characteristics of the microarchitecture.

OBJECTIVES

General Objective The study aims at the experimental validation of computational models of bone damage at the micro-scale. The general objective is pursued by controlled damage in a micro-compression machine on human bone samples from femoral head. The machinery is placed inside a synchrotron.

Primary Objective The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the difference in the attraction of bone damage with respect to gaps in the two groups considered (osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic) following micro-compression testing.

The discriminating parameter chosen turns out to be the number of bone gaps encountered by micro-damage. We expect to observe an effect size of 0.4 between the two groups with respect to the chosen parameter.

Secondary Objectives

* Determination of the role of gaps, canaliculi and other bone microstructures in damage. Human bone samples are scanned by micro-tomograph for the definition of microstructural morphological parameters and the realization and analysis of numerical models.
* Validation of these numerical models of damage by micro-compression tests carried out in situ in a synchrotron of adequate resolution
* Quantification of damage in human bone samples affected by osteoporosis
* Definition of micro-scale fracture indices, useful for the early diagnosis of osteoporosis",RECRUITING,,2020-11-09,2027-11-09,2026-07-09,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,52,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Hip replacement surgery"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""After hip replacement surgery the sponsor obtains femoral head samples for the study"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",PROCEDURE,hip replacement surgery,0

The anticipated study duration is 24 months and, as this study does not include direct contact with enrolled subjects, there is no anticipated follow up.","Pneumonia is the most common serious infection in childhood.

Within the Intermountain Healthcare System in Utah, Dean et al. exposed large differences in admission rates (range 38-79%) among 18 individual ED providers providing care for \>2,000 adults with pneumonia. Differences were not explained by patient characteristics or illness severity and higher rates of hospitalization did not reduce hospital readmissions or mortality.

OTHER,NCT00947479,Effect of Obstructive Sleep Apnea on Central Blood Pressure and Kidney and Endothelial Function,Effect of Correction of Obstructive Sleep Apnea With Positive Airway Pressure on Central Blood Pressure and Kidney and Endothelial Function,Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a frequently underdiagnosed condition that has emerged as an increasing medical problem with important social and financial implications worldwide. OSA is a well established risk factor for systemic hypertension myocardial infarction or stroke and it has been documented that blood pressure rises in a very consistent fashion during apneic episodes. The incidence of the episodes of apnea during sleep causes repeated subclinical acute kidney injuries (AKI) contributing to the development of CKD. One of the mechanisms responsible for AKI might be endothelial injury followed by an increase of central aortic pressure.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a frequently underdiagnosed condition that has emerged as an increasing medical problem with important social and financial implications worldwide. Its prevalence may reach 25% in middle-aged men and 11% in women. The most important risk factor for OSA is obesity - every 10% weight gain increases the incidence of the disease 6 times. OSA usually occurs in middle age males and is characterized by history of snoring, daytime somnolence and nocturnal choking or gasping. The underlying cause is transient cessation of airflow due to occlusion of the oropharyngeal tract. Episodes of apnea are considered important if they persist for longer than 10 seconds, but in some cases they may last as long as 2 minutes. The airway occlusion results in recurrent hypoxia, hypercapnia, arousals from sleep, compensatory hyperventilation leading to secondary hypocapnia and generation of exaggerated negative intrathoracic pressure that all can either directly or indirectly be harmful to the cardiovascular system through several pathways like sympathetic activation, inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Recurrent episodes of apnea/hypoxia may negatively affect the function of many organs, e.g. they induce (cyclical bradycardia during the apneic episodes, followed by tachycardia during the ensuing ventilatory phases) or rise blood pressure. Moreover, OSA is a well established risk factor for systemic hypertension myocardial infarction or stroke and it has been documented that blood pressure rises in a very consistent fashion during apneic episodes. The mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are complex because the direct effects of apnea (hypoxemia and low intrathoracic pressure) are modified by cardiopulmonary reflexes. Undoubtedly, the rapid increase in arterial pressure that occurs at the end of an apneic episode is mainly mediated by surges in sympathetic function during the arousal reaction.

Hypertension has emerged as a second, after diabetes mellitus, most frequent cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The rise of arterial blood pressure and endothelial damage due to ischaemia during apneic episodes may contribute to CKD. According to the recent findings OSA patients are much more frequently diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. The high frequency of OSA in patients with renal function impairment could be explained by the fact that the most common comorbid conditions of CKD, namely atherosclerosis and diabetes, are also independently associated with his syndrome. The detailed pathogenesis of the strong relation between OSA and CKD has not been investigated so far.

OSA patients are characterized by arterial stiffness, evaluated by pulse-wave velocity (PWV). PWV is a sensitive and validated marker of cardiovascular risk, including premature coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, stroke and cardiovascular mortality.

The diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) is routinely based on changes in serum creatinine, but its measurements are a poor indicator of acute deterioration in kidney function. First, serum creatinine concentrations might not change until about 50% of kidney function has already been lost. Second, serum creatinine levels can vary widely with age, sex, muscle mass, muscle metabolism, medications and hydration status. Novel, more specific and sensitive biomarkers of AKI are neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin C, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), which concentrations in both urine or serum rise significantly in patients with AKI and correlate with severity of kidney injury.

CKD is a devastating illness that has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. CKD is characterized by a progressive decline in kidney function that is associated with excess morbidity and mortality. The deterioration of kidney function can be delayed and patient outcome favorably affected if kidney disease is recognized and treated in a timely manner.

In our study we would like to prove that apneic episodes during sleep can cause repeated renal ischaemia-reperfusion injuries, which may lead to repeated acute subclinical kidney injuries (AKI) contributing to the development of chronic kidney disease.

The aim of this project is to study the influence of sleep apnea syndrome on the markers of acute kidney injury, endothelial function, arterial stiffness and central aortic pressure.",UNKNOWN,,2009-02,2011-07,2010-06,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,50,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""After being qualified into the study according to the aforementioned inclusion criteria and after giving an informed consent the polysomnography will be performed in all patients during night rest.In all patients eligible to sleep apnea treatment according to apnea/hypopnea index (AHI, number of apneic/hypopneic episodes per 1 h of effective sleep) from diagnostic polysomnography, CPAP treatment will be introduced under polysomnographic surveillance and the same panel of clinical and biochemical parameters will be evaluated."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER,continuous positive airway pressure (cpap),0

OTHER,NCT04181879,Appropriate Polypharmacy in Older People in Primary Care,A Pilot Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial of a Theory-based Intervention to Improve Appropriate Polypharmacy in Older People in Primary Care,"In the past, prescribing many medicines (polypharmacy) was seen in a negative light. However, because people are living longer and have several medical conditions at the same time, views on polypharmacy have changed. The challenge is to have the correct balance between enough medicines and too many medicines. Members of the research team have developed a new approach to achieving this balance. This approach has been tested in two general practices in Northern Ireland (NI). The approach (intervention package) currently consists of two parts: (1) a video showing how general practitioners (GPs) can prescribe appropriate polypharmacy for older patients, and (2) an appointment system for patients to visit a GP to have their medicines reviewed. As the intervention package was developed and tested in NI, further testing needs to be carried out in NI and the six border counties of the Republic of Ireland (ROI; Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan, and Sligo). This will be done in three stages or phases. In phase 1, which is now complete, 13 GPs were interviewed across 12 practices in the six border counties in the ROI; shown the video, asked about this new approach and asked if any changes are needed before doing more testing. In the next two phases (Phase 2 \& 3) a small study will be carried out involving 12 practices: six practices in NI and six practices in the six border counties in the ROI and approximately 10 patients per practice. GP practices will either receive the intervention package and conduct medication reviews with recruited patients (intervention group) or continue to treat recruited patients as usual (control group). Interviews with up to 10 GPs and six members of practice staff (i.e. those involved in implementing the intervention within each practice) respectively in the six intervention group practices will also be conducted at the end of the intervention. Patients from the six intervention group practices will be asked to complete a feedback questionnaire after the delivery of the intervention (i.e. after completion of their final follow-up questionnaires).","Design: We will perform a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial where 12 GP practices will be randomly assigned (6 GP practices per arm) to the intervention group versus usual care. Randomisation will be stratified according to location (Northern Ireland /Republic of Ireland - Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo). GP practices will be randomly allocated to the intervention or usual care arm after patient screening and recruitment. A total of 120 patients (60 per study arm, approximately 10 patients, randomly selected, per GP practice) will be enrolled into the study.

Design: Pilot cluster randomized controlled trial

Unit of randomization: GP practice.

Unit of analysis: Patient and GP practice.

Setting: Practices located in Northern Ireland will be recruited via Research Nurse(s) from the Northern Ireland Clinical Research Network (NICRN - Primary Care). In the Republic of Ireland a Research Nurse(s) from Trinity College Dublin will recruit GP practices located in the border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo.

Study aim: The overall aim of the study is to undertake a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) of a theory-based intervention targeting prescribing of appropriate polypharmacy in primary care (PolyPrime) to assess the feasibility of a definitive cRCT of the PolyPrime intervention.

The main study objectives are:

* To test approaches to sampling, recruitment and retention of GP practices
* To test approaches to screening, recruitment and retention of patients
* To test the feasibility of using medication appropriateness (assessed using the STOPP/START criteria) as the primary outcome in a future cRCT
* To identify the intervention's likely mechanism of action
* To assess if the intervention was delivered and received as intended (intervention fidelity)
* To identify the resources used in the set-up and delivery of the intervention and their associated costs
* To assess the feasibility of a future cost-effectiveness analysis
* To further validate the Medication-Related Burden quality of life (MRQ-QoL) tool
* To obtain estimates of effect size between groups, cluster size and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to inform the sample size calculation for a full RCT

Recruitment strategy for patients: Each recruited general practice will be asked to recruit 10 older patients meeting the inclusion criteria (i.e. over 70 years old, receiving four or more regular medicines, not cognitively impaired, not have a terminal illness, resident in the community, be in receipt of a valid general medical services (GMS) card in the Republic of Ireland, or for Northern Ireland patients, registered for NHS primary care services and registered with and/or regularly attending the practice for a minimum of 12 months). Each recruited GP practice will also display a patient recruitment poster in their practice waiting areas. Posters will direct patients to ask at reception if they are interested in taking part in the study.

The GP Practice Manager (or equivalent) will screen patient records facilitated and supported by the research nurses. Each practice will identify and filter potentially eligible participants via patient records. This will be done in batches depending upon the size of the practice list. Patients will be screened on the basis of the inclusion/exclusion criteria as specified in the protocol. A screening log will be provided to practices to record screening and recruitment activity, including the reason(s) for not being enrolled on the study. The screening log will be kept securely at the practice and no identifying data will leave the practice.

Intervention delivery: The intervention (video) will be delivered to recruited GPs allocated to the intervention arm using the 'Riverside' software programme. This software programme allows electronic, multimedia material to be delivered to healthcare professionals and students. GPs will be provided with a single generic username and password that will allow them to access the video on a secure online server. Prior to the commencement of the study, all participating GPs will be provided with instructions from the researcher on how to access the video. The researcher will be fully contactable during the study to answer any questions or queries that participating GPs may have about accessing the video.

Once consented, patients recruited by the GP practices allocated to the intervention arm will be asked to attend two appointments (telephone or online consultations where a face-to-face consultation is not possible) at a time convenient to them to have their medicines reviewed by a GP in addition to their usual care. Patients recruited by the GP practices allocated to the control arm will continue to receive usual care.

Data will be collected from recruited GPs, recruited patients and practice records. Recruited patients will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires relating to their general well-being and use of the health service (e.g. hospital admissions) at baseline, six months and nine months post-initial medication review in the intervention arm and the equivalent time points in the control arm. The follow up time points for the control arm will be based on the average length of time from the completion of baseline data collection to six and nine months post initial medication review in the intervention arm. Patient data (including medical history, clinical conditions, biochemical data (i.e. test results) and prescribed medications) will also be collected from GP records at baseline, six months and nine months by a Research Nurse from the Northern Ireland Clinical Research Network (NICRN Primary Care) or Trinity College Dublin (TCD).

At the end of the intervention, interviews will be conducted with up to 10 GPs and six members of practice staff (i.e. those involved in implementing the intervention within each practice) respectively in the six intervention arm practices. GPs will be asked about their views on the support provided by the research team; the intervention package (and supporting materials); study procedures (e.g. screening, recruitment, etc.), while practice staff will be asked about their views on the study procedures (e.g. screening, recruitment, etc.) and acceptability of the intervention.

OTHER,NCT05429879,The Impact of Music on Pain and Anxiety During Flexible Cystoscopies,"The Impact of Music on Pain and Anxiety During Flexible Cystoscopies: A Comparison Between the Patient's Preferred Music, Classical Music, and the Absence of Music","Background: Cystoscopy is a routine diagnostic test often performed in the outpatient Urology setting. However, patients may sometimes feel pain and anxiety during this procedure. Distraction therapies, including patient preferred music and classical music may reduce pain and anxiety associated with cystoscopy. However, it is unclear if patient preferred music has greater positive outcomes for patients than classical music.

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that patient preferred music during flexible cystoscopies will reduce patient self-reported pain and anxiety scores when compared to classical music and absence of music.

Objective: To assess whether a patient's preferred music reduces pain and anxiety during cystoscopies when compared to classical music and the absence of music Methods: This is a prospective randomized control study where patients undergoing flexible cystoscopy in the outpatient Urology clinic will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Preferred music, classical music, or no music for their procedure. Differences in pain and anxiety will be assessed between groups using the Visual Analog Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scale.

Potential Benefits: Identifying and understanding non-pharmacological interventions that can reduce pain and anxiety during cystoscopies is an important task that will allow urologists to better manage these patients.","Previous studies have shown that using music as a non-pharmacological intervention is an effective, safe, and inexpensive way to address pain and anxiety in patients during cystoscopies. However few studies have compared patient outcomes between preferred music and classical music groups, and no studies have compared these groups in a North American sample population. The intent of this project is to compare pain and anxiety in those listening to their preferred music, classical music, and no music during their cystoscopy to assess what might be the optimal way to provide this non-pharmacological intervention. Identifying and understanding non-pharmacological interventions that can reduce pain and anxiety during cystoscopies is an important task that will allow urologists to better manage these patients. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a patient's preferred choice of music on pain and anxiety when compared to classical music and the absence of music.

The study design will included a 1:1:1 randomization with equal group membership performed for both male and female sexes. Group 1 will allow patients to listen to their preferred music choice during cystoscopy, group 2 will listen to a standardized copyright free playlist of classical music, and group 3 will listen to no music and serve as a control group. Patients will be recruited and consented on the day of the procedure prior to filling out the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire. After their procedure, patients will fill out the STAI questionnaire; Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for pain, satisfaction, and discomfort; and Likert scales for patients to rate their music experience.

Music, when present, will be delivered via a speaker system allowing for communication between the urologist and the patient during the procedure. Only one urologist will be performing all flexible cystoscopies. Aside from the addition of music therapy for groups 1 and 2, standard of care will not be impacted.

Statistical analysis will be conducted by two-way ANCOVA comparing the mean of quantitative outcome variables between the three music groups and each sex. In the event of a significant interaction between the music and sex variables, one way-ANCOVA will be performed within each sex, followed by Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests.

All data will be collected and stored appropriately as according to institutional policies as well as any relevant chapters and sections of TCPS2.

Power analysis was performed to estimate the minimum sample size required to conduct the proposed ANCOVA analyses. A review of relevant literature indicated effect sizes ranging from small to large for both VAS and STAI scores. We therefore estimated our sample size using a medium effect size to provide a reasonable common ground among findings in the literature. Due to the 1:1:1 design for both sexes, we will target a sample size of 162 to allow for an equal allocation of 27 participants per group.",UNKNOWN,,2022-06-23,2024-05-30,2024-05-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,162,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Preferred Music Arm"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Patients will choose their preferred music to be played during the cystoscopy procedure.

A randomized design was used to test the overarching hypothesis that a novel program of mixed strength and power training would optimize the anabolic environment to promote muscle hypertrophy and robust gains in performance. This hypothesis was tested with three specific aims.

Specific Aim 1. We determined the effects of manipulating intensity, recovery, and mode of contraction on rates of muscle hypertrophy and muscle mass-dependent improvements in tests of in vivo muscle performance among older women and men. In brief, the four training models were: (1) traditional high-resistance concentric-eccentric training (H) 3 d/wk (HHH3); (2) high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 2 d/wk (HH2); (3) 3 d/wk mixed model consisting of high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 2 d/wk separated by 1 bout of low-resistance, high-velocity, concentric only training (L) (HLH3); and (4) 2 d/wk mixed model consisting of high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 1 d/wk and low-resistance, high-velocity, concentric only training 1 d/wk (HL2). For Aim 1, we hypothesized that the HLH3 prescription would prove optimal overall for combined gains in muscle mass, strength, power, and fatigue resistance in both women and men, while HL2 would be the least effective program due to insufficient weekly loading.

Specific Aim 2. Myofiber hypertrophy requires net muscle protein synthesis, and advanced fiber expansion is facilitated by nuclear addition. We are conducting a comprehensive evaluation of: (1) key regulatory steps in the protein synthesis/degradation machinery; and (2) myonuclear addition and satellite cell activation/cell cycle regulation. Quantitative relationships between metabolic/molecular responses and the magnitude of muscle hypertrophy among older adults will enable us to identify underlying factors that respond differently to these four resistance training models, potentially in a gender-specific manner, thus revealing important processes that drive the hypertrophy adaptation. We hypothesized that muscle protein synthesis and myonuclear addition, along with key underlying regulatory processes, would be most favorably affected by the work-recovery cycle of 2 d/wk high-resistance loading (HLH3 and HH2 models), thereby optimizing the anabolic environment for muscle hypertrophy in both older women and men.

Specific Aim 3. To translate the findings under Aim 1 to clinically important outcomes, we determined the degree to which non-traditional resistance training programs lead to improvements in mobility function and weight-bearing exercise difficulty. We hypothesized that a less stressful weekly training regimen consisting of fewer high-resistance contractions (HLH3) and/or fewer training sessions (HH2) while achieving substantial hypertrophy would promote equal or better improvements in mobility function and weight-bearing exercise difficulty than the traditionally prescribed HHH3 program.",COMPLETED,,2007-04,2013-03,2012-03,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,127,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""resistance training"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BEHAVIORAL,resistance training,1

The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of SUTENT in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme.Patients with tissue based diagnosis of intracranial glioblastoma multiforme, above 18 years of age and of both genders, who have a first tumor recurrence or progress after surgery, radiation- and chemotherapy will be included. The hypothesis is that SUTENT will significantly increase the progression free survival rate at 6 months in the study population.","Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults and shows an incidence of 5/100.000 inhabitants per year1. In Austria, approximately 350 patients are diagnosed with malignant glioma annually. Advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy do only have a minor impact on the natural course of these hardly treatable tumors. The mean survival time of adult patients with GBM is only 9-15 months from the time of diagnosis1,2. Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic approaches based on a better molecular understanding of tumor progression and tumor neovascularization.

Molecular Neurooncology has begun to elucidate the complexity of the transformed phenotype of GBM with the goal to identify important molecular changes in the tumor cell that may be amenable for targeted therapies3.

The elucidation of growth factor receptor signaling pathways responsible for the malignant phenotype is now being translated into molecular therapies. At present, targeted therapies with small molecule inhibitors directed against receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or downstream signaling pathways seem to be the most promising therapeutic approaches by directly influencing oncogenetically altered signaling pathways4. Imatinib Mesylate (STI571, Gleevec) is a potent inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl, PDGFR-α/ß, c-Fms and c-KIT tyrosine kinases. Its ability to inhibit PDGFR signaling suggested therapeutic potential in malignant gliomas, but single-agent imatinib showed only minimal therapeutic activity5. Erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva) and Gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa) are potent inhibitors of the Epidermal-Growth-Factor-Receptor (EGFR). However, both inhibitors have also demonstrated only limited activity in GBMs with response rates of 10 to 15% and no significant prolongation of survival6. Tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the farnesyl-transferase and influences the Ras oncogene pathway. Overexpression of Ras is implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant gliomas, but also amplified receptors as EGFR, PDGFR and VEGFR can lead to its downstream activation. Clinical trials with inhibition of the Ras signaling pathway showed also only limited biologic effects in GBM patients7.

3.2. Rationale for SUTENT treatment of GBM Patients Reason for the limited activity of selective targeting single agents, but also chemotherapeutic treatments, in GBM patients is the heterogeneity and redundancy of the molecular pathways in glioma cells8. Therefore, a multi-targeted therapy approach, inhibiting multiple molecular signaling pathways involved in tumor progression and tumor neovascularization seems to be a more promising treatment strategy.

SUTENT (SUNITINIB, SU11248) is a potent multi-target inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, PDGFR-α/β, FLT3, c-KIT, RET and CSF-1R. This drug has shown good solubility, bioavailability and protein-binding characteristics9 and was highly effective in metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (MRCC)10-12 and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)13,14.

The aggressiveness of GBM is reflected by a diffuse local infiltration into the brain parenchyma and a high tumor vascularization15,16. Neuropathological hallmarks of GBMs are pseudopalisades and microvascular hyperplasia. Pseudopalisades are characterized by an accumulation of hypoxic tumor cells around a central necrosis (Fig. 3A), resulting from increased metabolic demands of tumor cells or vascular occlusion. Such tumor cells express high levels of hypoxia-inducible regulators of angiogenesis, including the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α. HIF-α accumulates in the tumor cell and binds with its constitutively present partner HIF-β. The HIF complex leads to transcription of hypoxia-induced genes, such as VEGF and PDGF17. These growth factors are secreted into the extracellular space by tumor cells and bind to its high-affinity receptors located on

1. tumor cells (autocrine action), leading to tumor cell proliferation and survival, but also stimulation of the HIF-α protein synthesis and
2. endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes (paracrine action), leading to tumor-related neoangiogenesis18-21.

Therefore, VEGF may induce microvascular hyperplasia (Fig. 1B), a typical form of neoangiogenesis immediately related to pseudopalisading cells16,22. Since necrosis and hypoxia are located in the GBM's core, the most biologically relevant hypoxia-induced neovascularization occurs further peripherally, favouring diffuse infiltration by individual glioma cells and allows peripheral GBM expansion.

Summary of molecular and clinical rationales for SUTENT treatment of GBM patients

In this project, it is aimed to examine the effect of telerehabilitation-based instrumental and noninstrumental respiratory exercise program on lung capacities. For this reason;

* Contributing to the literature by comparing the effect of breathing exercises with and without instruments on lung capacities,
* It is aimed to be a resource for the effective use of respiratory exercise, which has a high effect on lung capacities, in treatment.

In addition, with the data obtained, it is aimed to decide and apply the exercise that is more effective in the treatment of respiratory diseases quickly.

Socio-demographic data will be questioned by using the Demographic Data Form; participants, age, gender, height, weight, marital status, smoking and alcohol use, presence of disease, whether they are included in a different exercise program, dyspnea, severe nausea and vomiting. The cases will be randomized into two groups: non-instrumented breathing exercises group and instrumented breathing exercises group. The physical activity status of the individuals participating in the study will be questioned using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) at the beginning and end of the study. Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) will be used to measure the lung capacity of the participants.

Instrumented breathing exercises will be performed for 8 weeks, 2 days a week with the telerehabilitation program, 3 days a week as a home program, 5 days a week in total, starting with 1 set of 15 repetitions and the program will progress with progression. Diaphragmatic breathing and thoracic extension exercises will be applied as non-instrumented breathing exercises. For 8 weeks, 2 days a week with telerehabilitation method, 3 days a week as a home program, 5 days a week in total, 1 set of 10 repetitions for each exercise and the program will progress with progression. At the end of 8 weeks, all evaluations of the participants in both groups will be repeated.","Breathing exercises are one of the components of pulmonary rehabilitation that have been widely used in clinical practice for many years. Exercises such as pursed lip breathing, local expansion, diagraphmatic breathing, holding at maximum inspiration are some of the breathing exercises in the literature. Such breathing exercises dilate the airways, facilitate gas exchange in the alveoli, increase the amount of oxygen reaching the cells, and normalize respiratory functions. Diaphragmatic breathing is a technique that uses the contraction of the diaphragm muscle to increase the length of the diaphragm and the efficiency of breathing, resulting in more efficient expiration. Studies have shown that diaphragmatic breathing reduces respiratory workload and dyspnea, increases respiratory efficiency and exercise tolerance, and improves minute ventilation by reducing the number of breaths. The aim of respiratory exercises is to maintain and improve respiratory function and to increase the amount of air entering and leaving the lungs. The amount of incoming and outgoing air is called lung volume and capacity. Lung volumes and capacities; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), Tiffeneau index (FEV1\\FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF) will be compared.

There are also many therapeutic devices developed among respiratory exercises. The incentive spirometer is one of these exercise devices. The incentive spirometer can be used for two different purposes: volume-oriented or flow-oriented. Studies have shown that volume-oriented devices are more effective in improving respiratory parameters than flow-oriented devices. In the literature, it is stated that the use of spirometers increases lung capacities, provides more comfortable air entry into the alveoli and facilitates gas exchange.

Telerehabilitation method is defined as the remote delivery of rehabilitation services by rehabilitation specialists with certain procedures and protocols using tools such as information and communication technologies. With telerehabilitation, it is aimed to follow patients at home, to carry rehabilitation services far away and to provide health services directly where the patient is.

In this project, it is aimed to examine the effect of telerehabilitation-based instrumental and noninstrumental respiratory exercise program on lung capacities.

Secondary Objective: To assess efficacy of repeat topical application of 2% and 0.5% SADBE in the prevention of herpes labialis episodes.","Primary oral infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV) typically occurs at a young age, is asymptomatic, and is not associated with significant morbidity. After primary oral infection, HSV may persist in a latent state in the trigeminal ganglion and later reactivate as the more common herpes labialis, or ""cold sores."" Common triggers for reactivation are well known and include ultraviolet light, trauma, fatigue, stress, fever, inflammation, and menstruation. These lesions affect up to 45 percent of the U.S. population. They classically manifest as a well-localized cluster of small vesicles along the vermilion border of the lip or adjacent skin. The vesicles subsequently rupture, ulcerate, and crust within 24 to 48 hours. Spontaneous healing occurs over seven to 10 days.

In immunocompetent patients, herpes labialis usually is mild and self-limited. However, pain, swelling, and cosmetic concerns may prompt physician consultation. Orally administered antiviral agents, such as acyclovir (Zovirax) or valacyclovir (Valtrex), have a modest clinical benefit if initiated during the prodrome. Topical treatment with 1% penciclovir cream (Denavir) may reduce healing time and pain slightly, even if initiated after the prodrome. However, reduction in healing time with systemic or topical agents is modest.

Squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE) is a topical immunotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of verruca vulgaris and alopecia areata. During a recent FDA Compounding Advisory Committee Meeting, it was recommended that squaric acid dibutylester be included on the list of bulk drug substances allowed for use in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. And SADBE has now been so listed under section 503A.

A study completed by Lee et al of 29 patients with recalcitrant warts demonstrated complete clearance in 69% of patients with application every 2-4 weeks. Silverberg et al showed a complete clearance in 58% of patients (n=61) when SADBE was applied 3 times weekly. A placebo-controlled clinical study completed at Massachusetts General Hospital showed that squaric acid prevented recurrence of herpetic lesions. The effect of SADBE of delaying new herpes labialis outbreaks was highly significant (p\<0.01) as compared to placebo.

Morphological changes occur in the body in amputees due to upper extremity amputation. In addition, neural restructuring occurs due to the lack of sensory input and visual feedback. These neurophysiological changes experienced in amputees affect the cortical areas of the brain. This situation can also negatively affect motor imagery ability. For this reason, upper extremity prosthesis systems with different control mechanisms have been developed. In one of the developed systems, myoelectric prostheses, since the signals received with electrodes due to muscle contraction provide sensory input to amputees, known that it increases synaptic sprouting in the brain and improves motor imagery ability. There are studies that use motor imagery in stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, postoperative anterior cruciate ligament injuries, cervical and lumbar region pain problems. In addition, it focused on motor imagery after amputation and emphasized that the evidence on whether motor imagery ability is impaired in amputees is not sufficient. In a study, it was found that the use of upper extremity prosthesis increases the hand mental rotation ability and this situation is related to the body integrity of amputees with the use of prosthesis. After investigatorsexamination and screening, to the best of investigators knowledge, no study was found that evaluated the motor imagery ability of transradial amputees using myoelectric controlled prosthesis and examined its effect on functionality. Therefore, the aim of investigators study is to evaluate the motor imagery ability in transradial amputees using myoelectric prosthesis, compare it with the control group and investigate its effect on functionality and proprioception.

Recent evidence also suggests that surgical stress may be associated with a 40% reduction in circulating 25(OH)D levels when compared to preoperative values. Moreover, the derangement in perioperative 25(OH)D levels may be sustained for up to 3 months after surgery. This finding has potential implications regarding modifiable risk factors for surgical site infections (SSIs), which account for nearly 40% of all nosocomial infections. On aggregate, SSIs result in 3.7 million extra hospital days per annum and an added burden of $1.6 billion in annual healthcare costs.

Currently, there is a lack of information in the literature regarding the optimal number of intravesical BTA injection sites.

Prior studies evaluated efficacy using 100u BTA spread across 20 injections sites, however current practices at local institutions safely use 10 injections sites based on studies showing similar effect and adverse event profiles between use of 10, 20, and 40 injection sites.\[5,6\] Research using animal models has shown diffuse distribution of BTA within the entire detrusor muscle after just a single BTA injection at one site.\[7\] This has been corroborated in human studies.\[8\] A recently published observational pilot study shows promise for single site intradetrusor Botox® injection as it reported a lower rate of urinary retention and similar durability.\[9\] Similar clinical efficacy with only one to three intravesical BTA injection\[s\] has also been reported.\[10\]

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a condition where the heart squeezes well but is stiff. This stiffness in the heart muscle makes the heart unable to fill, leading to shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance. Subjects with HFPEF are asked to participate in this study. There will be approximately 40 participants enrolled in this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Ranolazine (Ranexa) in patients with HFPEF. The study is sponsored by the manufacturers of the drug, Gilead Pharmaceuticals.

Ranolazine is a drug that affects the ion channels in the heart. In patients with heart failure, these ion channels do not work properly, and contribute to make the heart stiff. A stiff heart leads to the symptoms of shortness of breath which patients with HFPEF experience. Due to its properties, Ranolazine may improve this stiffness. Ranolazine could improve subject's shortness of breath and ability to exercise.

Currently, ranolazine carries FDA approval for the treatment of chronic angina only. We intend to study ranolazine in patients with HFPEF, in the absence of documented ischemia, to determine whether the drug's lusitropic properties can improve exercise capacity in HFPEF patients.

Previous trials of ranolazine in patients with chronic angina found that there was a dose-dependent relationship between improvements in exercise capacity and ranolazine. However, there did appear to be a plateau in which 1500 mg of ranolazine twice daily improved exercise capacity only slightly more than 1000 mg of ranolazine given twice daily. Additionally, there was a substantially higher rate of adverse events (mainly nausea, dizziness, and asthenia) with the higher dose. Given the desire to maximize benefit and minimize the risk of adverse events, ranolazine 1000 mg by mouth twice daily was chosen as the target dose.

To properly evaluate the effects of Ranolazine, this research study is set up as a double blind, placebo controlled study. Subjects will be randomly assigned (like rolling a dice) to either Ranolazine or placebo (inactive substance).

This study will examine how risk factors for heart disease in young and middle aged people affect people's health as they grow older.,"Heart disease, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), is a serious health problem in the United States. It is the leading cause of death in this country, and each year almost 700,000 people die from the disease. Risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, tobacco use, diabetes, and history of a prior heart attack. It has been shown that young and middle aged adults with few risk factors experience a lower incidence of heart disease, lower Medicare costs, and longer lives than those with more risk factors. However, it is not known how having a low risk for heart disease at a young age affects health-related outcomes in older age. It may be possible that a low risk for developing heart disease in younger years results in healthier aging than does a higher risk. This study will examine former participants of the Chicago Heart Association (CHA) study who are now 65 to 84 years old. The purpose of this study is to determine how risk factors for heart disease in young adulthood and middle age are related to healthy aging.

This study will enroll 1500 people who participated in the CHA study from 1967 to 1973 and who are still living in the Greater Chicagoland area. Six hundred former participants who had a low risk of developing heart disease and 900 former participants who had a high risk of developing heart disease will be enrolled. Participants will attend one study visit that will include medical history interviews and questionnaires, a physical examination, blood pressure measurements, blood and urine collection, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical activity of the heart. Blood samples will be collected and stored for future genetic testing. Participants will undergo physical functioning performance tests on balance, leg strength and coordination, grip strength, and endurance. They will also undergo a computed tomography chest scan to measure the amount of calcium in the arteries of the heart and ultrasound scans of the arteries in the neck to measure artery size and function.",COMPLETED,,2007-11,2010-12,2010-08,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,1395,ACTUAL,[],,,1

OTHER,NCT06956079,Effect of End-inspiratory Pause on Gas Exchange During Mediastinal Mass Excision With CO2 Insufflation and One-lung Ventilation,Effect of End-inspiratory Pause on Gas Exchange During Mediastinal Mass Excision With CO2 Insufflation and One-lung Ventilation,""" Mediastinal mass excision is typically performed via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). To secure a clear surgical field, the ipsilateral lung must be deflated, achieved through one-lung ventilation (OLV) and intrathoracic CO₂ insufflation. However, OLV increases intrapulmonary shunt due to continued perfusion of the non-ventilated lung, potentially leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

When performed in the supine position, gas exchange becomes more challenging compared to lateral decubitus due to limited gravitational redistribution of blood flow. Although CO₂ insufflation aids surgical exposure through passive lung deflation, it may also increase CVP and PCWP, reduce cardiac output, and raise PaCO₂, contributing to respiratory acidosis.

End-inspiratory pause (EIP), a ventilatory setting that pauses airflow at end-inspiration, prolongs alveolar gas exchange and improves ventilation-perfusion matching. Prior studies show EIP can enhance gas exchange, reduce microatelectasis, and improve CO₂ clearance in patients with acute lung injury. We therefore aimed to assess the effect of EIP application during VATS mediastinal mass excicion.",,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2025-05,2027-03-10,2027-03-10,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,TRIPLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,58,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""EIP-first"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""EIP is applied for 20 minutes immediately after the initiation of one-lung ventilation, followed by conventional mechanical ventilation."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""EIP-later"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""Conventional mechanical ventilation is applied for 20 minutes after the initiation of one-lung ventilation, followed by EIP application."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",PROCEDURE;PROCEDURE,eip-first;eip-later,0

NIH,NCT01259479,Satraplatin in Children and Young Adults With Refractory Solid Tumors Including Brain Tumors,A Phase I Trial and Pharmacokinetic Study of the Oral Platinum Analog Satraplatin in Children and Young Adults With Refractory Solid Tumors Including Brain Tumors,"Background:

* Cisplatin and carboplatin are standard cancer treatment drugs used for various childhood cancers, including brain tumors. Both drugs frequently have severe side effects that may reduce their effectiveness, particularly in children, and new treatments are needed that may be similarly effective but less toxic for cancer patients.
* Satraplatin is an experimental drug, similar to cisplatin and carboplatin, that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Satraplatin has been shown to treat cancer by interfering with genetic material (DNA) in cancer cells. Some adults with cancer who have received satraplatin had slowing of the growth or shrinkage of their tumor. Researchers are interested in determining whether satraplatin can be effective for cancers that occur in children.

Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of satraplatin as a treatment for children and young adults who have solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment.
* To study the effects of satraplatin on the body in terms of side effects and blood chemistry.
* To examine the effect that genetic variations may have on the effectiveness of satraplatin.

Eligibility:

- Children, adolescents, and young adults between 3 and 21 years of age who have solid tumors (including brain tumors) that have not responded to standard treatment.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history, blood tests, and tumor imaging studies.
* Participants will receive satraplatin pills to be taken every day in the morning for 5 consecutive days, with no food for 2 hours before or 1 hour after the dose. Participants will then have 23 days without the drug to complete a 28-day cycle of treatment. Participants will also receive medication to prevent nausea and vomiting 30 minutes before the first dose of satraplatin. Following the first dose of satraplatin, medication for nausea will be given if needed.
* Satraplatin doses will be adjusted based on response to treatment, including potential side effects. Participants will have frequent blood tests and imaging studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and monitor any side effects, as well as hearing tests and other examinations as required by the study researchers.
* Participants will receive satraplatin every 4 weeks for up to 2 years until serious side effects occur or the tumor stops responding to treatment.","BACKGROUND

The platinum compounds cisplatin and carboplatin are standard agents in the treatment of a variety of childhood cancers. However, cumulative and long-term renal and ototoxicity are a concern related to cisplatin administration, particularly in young children.

Several mechanisms of resistance to platinum compounds have been described including decreased drug accumulation due to altered drug uptake or the presence of a membrane efflux pump, increased intracellular levels of thiol-containing groups that detoxify and modulate platinum, and removal of the platinum-DNA adducts by DNA repair pathways called nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways.

Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes have been shown in some cancers to predict better treatment response to platinum treatment.

Satraplatin is an oral platinum analog with similar preclinical in vitro and in vivo activity to that of cisplatin and carboplatin, and with activity in platinum resistant models.

Dose-limiting satraplatin toxicities in adults include nausea, vomiting, and myelosuppression. Neither renal nor neurologic toxicities have been described.

Satraplatin has demonstrated clinical activity in adult refractory tumors at the recommended phase II and III dose of 80 mg/m2/dose daily for 5 days every 28 or 35 days.

OBJECTIVES

To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral satraplatin administered on a once daily for 5 days every 28 days schedule in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors including brain tumors.

To define the toxicities of oral satraplatin and characterize the pharmacokinetics of oral satraplatin in children with refractory cancer.

To determine the preliminary antitumor activity of satraplatin.

To evaluate the pharmacogenomic expression of DNA repair genes in peripheral blood mononuclear blood cells.

ELIGIBILITY

Patients greater than or equal to 3 years and less than or equal to 25 years at enrollment with relapsed or refractory solid tumors including brain tumors.

Adequate organ function

DESIGN

This is a phase I trial of satraplatin administered once daily orally for 5 days every 28 days. A cycle of therapy is considered to be 28 days. The starting dose level is 60 mg/m(2)/dose with escalations to 80, 110, 140 mg/m(2)/dose. The MTD will be defined based on satraplatin tolerability during cycle one.

Disease status will be evaluated prior to every odd treatment cycle and therapy may continue for up to 2 years in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

Plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics will be evaluated during the first treatment cycle.",COMPLETED,,2010-12-03,2015-05-29,2013-08-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,9,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Satraplatin"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Orally, once daily for 5 days repeated every 28 days, dose-escalation"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,satraplatin,1
