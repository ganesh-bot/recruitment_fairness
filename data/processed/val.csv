National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),NIH,NCT05078879,Empagliflozin as a Treatment for Severe Congenital Neutropenia Due to G6PC3 Deficiency,A Phase 1 Study of Empagliflozin as Treatment for Severe Congenital Neutropenia Due to G6PC3 Deficiency,"Background:

Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is an immune system disease. People with SCN do not have enough of a kind of white blood cell called neutrophils. This means they get sick easily from infections. Some drugs to treat SCN have lots of side effects. Researchers want to see if a the drug empagliflozin can help increase the number of neutrophils in a person with SCN.

Objective:

To see if a drug called empagliflozin can help people with SCN.

Eligibility:

Adults aged 18 and older with SCN.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests. They may have a pregnancy test.

Participants will have study visits and local lab visits. They will repeat the screening tests. They will have heart and lung function tests. They will have an ultrasound of the liver and spleen. Their skin symptoms will be photographed. They may have consultations with specialists. They may give a stool sample. They may have an optional colonoscopy with tissue sample collection. They may have an optional bone marrow biopsy and aspirate. They may have an optional magnetic resonance imaging scan of their heart.

Participants will be admitted to NIH for 5 7 days. They will start taking the study drug as a pill once daily. They will be monitored for side effects.

Participants will take the study drug at home for 12 months. They will use a fingerstick blood glucose meter to measure blood sugar at home.

Participants may be able to take the study drug through their local doctor after the study ends.

Participation will last for 15 months.","One symptom of G6PC3 deficiency is recurrent infections resulting from severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Data suggest that SCN is the result of accumulation of the toxic dietary metabolite 1,5 anhydroglucitol 6 phosphate (1,5-AG6P) in leukocytes. This buildup inhibits glycolytic metabolism, thus impairing their function. Increasing urinary glucose excretion results in the urinary excretion of the precursor to 1,5-AG6P, and will likely reduce levels of 1,5-AG6P in leukocytes.

In this phase 1 open-label study, we will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the sodium glucose co transporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients with G6PC3 deficiency. Empagliflozin is FDA approved in doses of 10 or 25 mg daily for treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. Eligible participants (n=5) aged \>=18 years will be on a 2-month daily regimen of 10 mg of oral empagliflozin (phase A). Participants may then be increased to 25 mg daily (phase B) if the participant fails to achieve an adequate improvement in neutropenia during phase A and is able to tolerate the higher dose, or alternatively may continue on the 10-mg dose. Participants will temporarily discontinue any current granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) regimen starting at least 7 days before the empagliflozin regimen begins, to remove or reduce the effects of concomitant G-CSF so the baseline ANC can be evaluated without confounding factors.

People with SCN do not have enough of a kind of white blood cell called neutrophils. This means they get sick easily from infections. Some drugs to treat SCN have lots of side effects. Researchers want to see if a the drug empagliflozin can help increase the number of neutrophils in a person with SCN. Objective: To see if a drug called empagliflozin can help people with SCN. Eligibility: Adults aged 18 and older with SCN. Design: Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests. They may have a pregnancy test. Participants will have study visits and local lab visits. They will repeat the screening tests. They will have heart and lung function tests. They will have an ultrasound of the liver and spleen. Their skin symptoms will be photographed. They may have consultations with specialists. They may give a stool sample. They may have an optional colonoscopy with tissue sample collection. They may have an optional bone marrow biopsy and aspirate. They may have an optional magnetic resonance imaging scan of their heart. Participants will be admitted to NIH for 5 7 days. They will start taking the study drug as a pill once daily. They will be monitored for side effects. Participants will take the study drug at home for 12 months. They will use a fingerstick blood glucose meter to measure blood sugar at home. Participants may be able to take the study drug through their local doctor after the study ends. Participation will last for 15 months. One symptom of G6PC3 deficiency is recurrent infections resulting from severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Data suggest that SCN is the result of accumulation of the toxic dietary metabolite 1,5 anhydroglucitol 6 phosphate (1,5-AG6P) in leukocytes. This buildup inhibits glycolytic metabolism, thus impairing their function. Increasing urinary glucose excretion results in the urinary excretion of the precursor to 1,5-AG6P, and will likely reduce levels of 1,5-AG6P in leukocytes. In this phase 1 open-label study, we will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the sodium glucose co transporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin in patients with G6PC3 deficiency. Empagliflozin is FDA approved in doses of 10 or 25 mg daily for treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. Eligible participants (n=5) aged \>=18 years will be on a 2-month daily regimen of 10 mg of oral empagliflozin (phase A). Participants may then be increased to 25 mg daily (phase B) if the participant fails to achieve an adequate improvement in neutropenia during phase A and is able to tolerate the higher dose, or alternatively may continue on the 10-mg dose. Participants will temporarily discontinue any current granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) regimen starting at least 7 days before the empagliflozin regimen begins, to remove or reduce the effects of concomitant G-CSF so the baseline ANC can be evaluated without confounding factors. During phase A, participants will have blood drawn locally every two weeks for clinical lab evaluations (including ANC). A member of the study team will also contact the participant for remote AE assessment at each blood draw. During phase B, blood draws and remote AE assessments will be monthly for the first 4 months, and bimonthly for the last 6 months. Participants will have outpatient study visits at the NIH Clinical Center at the end of phase A (month 2), and at months 6 and 12 during phase B. * INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Aged \>=18 years. 2.

Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Santa Casa de São Paulo,OTHER,NCT01965379,Effect of Restriction of Foods Containing Phosphorus Additives,Effect of Restriction of Foods Containing Phosphorus Additives on the Phosphatemia of Patients With End-stage Renal Disease.,"Hyperphosphatemia is related to the increase in morbidity and mortality. There is greater risk for cardiovascular disease, atherosclerotic disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease .

The serum phosphorus level can be controlled by a combination of factors, such as: reduction of ingestion, reduction of intestinal absorption with chelating agents and increase in elimination by dialysis.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of dietary intervention consisting of the restriction of industrialized foods with phosphorus additives in chronic kidney disease patients treated with hemodialysis.","The consumption of foods which contain phosphorus by patients on hemodialysis should be monitored in order to reflect the current reality, due to the increase in ingestion of industrialized foods rich in phosphorus additives. Data from studies performed in the USA shows a reduction in phosphatemia with nutritional orientation to reduce foods containing additives from restaurants in the region of the study . In another study, also conducted in the USA, the researchers evaluated the phosphorus content and presence of additives in appetizers and side orders served at fast food restaurants in Cleveland. The results showed that of the appetizers, 52% were accepted by the traditional criteria for the renal diet (low content of sodium, potassium and organic or natural phosphorus), but only 16% were also free of phosphorus additives; of the side orders, 23% were accepted by the traditional criteria and 17% were exempt of phosphorus additives. Thus, only a small proportion of appetizers and side orders served at fast food restaurants were compatible with the renal diet.

Hyperphosphatemia is related to the increase in morbidity and mortality. There is greater risk for cardiovascular disease, atherosclerotic disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease . The serum phosphorus level can be controlled by a combination of factors, such as: reduction of ingestion, reduction of intestinal absorption with chelating agents and increase in elimination by dialysis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of dietary intervention consisting of the restriction of industrialized foods with phosphorus additives in chronic kidney disease patients treated with hemodialysis. The consumption of foods which contain phosphorus by patients on hemodialysis should be monitored in order to reflect the current reality, due to the increase in ingestion of industrialized foods rich in phosphorus additives.

National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA),NIH,NCT00884884,Aripiprazole and Topiramate on Free-Choice Alcohol Use,Aripiprazole and Topiramate on Free-Choice Alcohol Use,"The current study investigates the effects of two potential alcohol treatment medications on drinking in a laboratory setting. Aripiprazole (APZ), effects dopamine and serotonin receptors with fewer limiting side effects seen with other atypical antipsychotics. Topiramate (TPMT), an antiepileptic, affects glutamate and GABA-A receptors and shows promise in reducing heavy drinking. Few studies have used two medications with such a diverse combination of actions to examine a potential synergistic effect on reducing alcohol consumption.

The primary aims are to:

1. determine if APZ and TPMT are each more effective than placebo, and the combination of APZ and TPMT is more effective than either drug alone or placebo, in reducing alcohol use in non-treatment seeking alcohol dependent subjects in a laboratory based alcohol self-administration experiment (ASAE)
2. examine a hypothesized dose-response for three doses of APZ (0, 7.5 mg/d and 15 mg/d) along with three doses of TPMT (0, 100mg/d and 200mg/d)
3. examine the putative mechanisms of action of APZ, TPMT alone and together on craving, subjective stimulation, candidate gene influences and other behavioral effects associated with alcohol consumption
4. establish the safety of giving APZ and TPMT together. Non-treatment seeking, alcohol dependent Participants (N=216) will be recruited from the community and randomly assigned to one of the 9 cells. Subjects drinking and safety is monitored over a 5-week titration to their target dose, leading to an in-laboratory alcohol self administration session, during which clinical and behavioral effects are assessed during access to alcohol. A 1 month follow-up assesses adverse events and drinking.","Due to the modest effect of current pharmacotherapies, more effective treatments must be developed to optimally treat alcohol dependent patients. Treatments combining pharmacotherapies with different mechanisms of action may better address the diverse neurobiology of alcohol and the heterogeneity of alcoholics. However, little is known about how medication may affect behavior to reduce drinking. Aripiprazole (APZ), a partial dopamine agonist, affects dopamine and serotonin receptors without the limiting side effects seen with other atypical antipsychotics. Dopamine mediates reward based drinking and craving. Topiramate (TPMT), an antiepileptic, affects glutamate and GABA-A receptors and shows promise in reducing heavy drinking. Glutamate and GABA may mediate relief-based drinking and protracted withdrawal. Despite strong evidence that multiple neurotransmitters contribute to alcoholism, few studies have used two medications with such a diverse combination of actions to examine a potential synergistic effect on reducing alcohol consumption.

The present study will recruit 216 healthy, alcohol-dependent volunteers who are not currently seeking treatment for their alcohol dependence to learn more about how these medications may work.

The primary aims are to: (1) determine if APZ and TPMT are each more effective than placebo, and the combination of APZ and TPMT is more effective than either drug alone or placebo, in reducing alcohol use in non-treatment seeking alcohol dependent subjects in an alcohol self administration experiment (ASAE); (2) examine a hypothesized dose-response for three doses of APZ (0, 7.5mg/d and 15 mg/d) and three doses of TPMT (0, 100mg/d, 200mg/d); (3) examine the putative mechanisms of action of APZ, TPMT alone and together on craving, subjective stimulation, candidate gene influences and other behavioral effects associated with alcohol consumption; and (4) establish the safety of giving APZ and TPMT together.

The amount of collagen protein synthesized will be indirectly measured by measuring procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) in the serum before and 4hrs after the last exercise bout.

It is expected that this project will determine whether greater increases in collagen synthesis are observed with repeated doses of HC and exercise, compared with a single dose and exercise bout (from previous research). This study will also determine whether collagen synthesis is similarly stimulated with PrimaColl, or whey protein. Results from this study will help to better prescribe the use of dietary collagen and exercise training to improve collagen synthesis in healthy young people. Improved collagen synthesis has the potential to decrease ligament, tendon, and bone injuries in the general and athletic populations.

Male and female participants between the ages of 18-30 years of age will be enrolled in the study. A randomized double-blind crossover design with neither the subjects nor the investigators knowing who is on which treatment (HC, PC, WP or PL).

I. Baseline blood draw

The subjects will arrive in the laboratory following an overnight fast. The antecubital vein will be cannulated, and an initial 5 mL baseline blood sample will be collected.

II. Supplementation

After baseline blood draw subjects will be provided with a supplement as shown in the table below. Subjects will be asked to consume the supplement that will be pre-mixed with 250 ml of water 60 min before the jump rope exercise. This will be repeated 3 times, separated by 12 hours over a 24h period.

III. Exercise

Sixty minutes after the ingestion of the supplement, each participant will complete 6 minutes of jump rope. This will be repeated on 3 occasions over a 24hr period. Subjects will be asked to abstain from vigorous exercise during the 24hr period, aside from the prescribed jump rope exercise.

Subjects will be asked to ingest supplement and jump rope in lab for time point 1. Subjects will be given the option to ingest supplement and jump rope outside lab if more conducive to their scheduling restrictions at time points 2 and 3 blood draws are not required at these timepoints. Subjects will be asked to return to the lab 4 hours after last jumping session for blood sampling.

Blood draws for PNIP analysis

Blood samples (5 mL) at different time points:

* Baseline 2 vials will be drawn (1 for PINP and the other for bioassays)
* 1h after the first supplementation 1 vial will be drawn (bioassay)
* 4hrs post-exercise session number 3 the last vial will be drawn (PINP) Blood will be collected in 5 mL serum separating tubes and allowed to clot for 1hr before centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 minutes and the serum will be frozen and kept at -30°C until processed. PINP levels will be determined by electrochemiluminescence (ECL; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total number of blood draws will be 12 (3 per intervention with 4 interventions).

To achieve this, participants will consume a supplemental dose of HC (20g with 50mg vitamin C), PC (20g with 50mg vitamin C), whey protein (20g whey isolate with 50mg vitamin C) or a placebo (20g maltodextrin with 50mg vitamin C) 1hr prior to an exercise bout (6 minutes of jump rope), this will be repeated three times over a 24h period. The amount of collagen protein synthesized will be indirectly measured by measuring pro-collagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) in the serum before and 4hrs after the last exercise bout. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of repeated dosing of vitamin C enriched hydrolyzed collagen (HC) over a 24hr period, compared to PrimaColl™ (PC), whey protein (WP) and placebo (PL), with prescribed exercise on collagen synthesis. To achieve this, participants will consume a supplemental dose of HC (20g with 50mg vitamin C), PC (20g with 50mg vitamin C), whey protein (20g whey isolate with 50mg vitamin C) or a placebo (20g maltodextrin with 50mg vitamin C) 1hr prior to exercise bouts (6 minutes of jump rope). The amount of collagen protein synthesized will be indirectly measured by measuring procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP) in the serum before and 4hrs after the last exercise bout. It is expected that this project will determine whether greater increases in collagen synthesis are observed with repeated doses of HC and exercise, compared with a single dose and exercise bout (from previous research). This study will also determine whether collagen synthesis is similarly stimulated with PrimaColl, or whey protein. Results from this study will help to better prescribe the use of dietary collagen and exercise training to improve collagen synthesis in healthy young people. Improved collagen synthesis has the potential to decrease ligament, tendon, and bone injuries in the general and athletic populations.

Baseline blood draw The subjects will arrive in the laboratory following an overnight fast. The antecubital vein will be cannulated, and an initial 5 mL baseline blood sample will be collected. II. Supplementation After baseline blood draw subjects will be provided with a supplement as shown in the table below. Subjects will be asked to consume the supplement that will be pre-mixed with 250 ml of water 60 min before the jump rope exercise. This will be repeated 3 times, separated by 12 hours over a 24h period. III. Exercise Sixty minutes after the ingestion of the supplement, each participant will complete 6 minutes of jump rope. This will be repeated on 3 occasions over a 24hr period. Subjects will be asked to abstain from vigorous exercise during the 24hr period, aside from the prescribed jump rope exercise. Subjects will be asked to ingest supplement and jump rope in lab for time point 1. Subjects will be given the option to ingest supplement and jump rope outside lab if more conducive to their scheduling restrictions at time points 2 and 3 blood draws are not required at these timepoints. Subjects will be asked to return to the lab 4 hours after last jumping session for blood sampling.

The drugs and schedules will vary depending on the status of the cancer and its level of risk for spreading, but they will include combinations of doxorubicin (non-liposomal), cisplatin, methotrexate, and ifosfamide, as described below.","The Study Drugs:

The standard treatment combination used to treat patients with osteosarcoma is doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate with or without ifosfamide. When this treatment combination is given in the hospital, it can require around 18-22 hospital stays. Somewhat recently, chemotherapy for osteosarcoma has become possible to give in the outpatient clinic. Researchers want to learn if giving 4 certain drugs (the combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate with or without ifosfamide) in the outpatient setting to eligible patients will help to decrease the number of hospital stays.

During this study, all study participants whose tumor(s) can be taken out with surgery will be offered routine surgery to remove the tumor(s). After surgery, if the doctor believes the tumor(s) have responded well enough, the standard treatment combination is again doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate. If the tumor(s) have not responded well enough, however, the standard treatment combination is methotrexate and ifosfamide.

In this study, participants are considered at ""higher risk"" for the tumor(s) spreading to the lungs in the following cases: if the participant's tumor(s) are large at the time of joining this study, if the cancer has spread to other organs, and/or if standard chemotherapy in this study has not killed enough tumor cells.

The following drugs are used in this study:

* Doxorubicin is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die.
* Cisplatin has an atom at its center that contains a type of metal called platinum. The platinum is supposed to poison the cancer cells.
* Methotrexate is designed to disrupt cells (including cancer cells) from making and repairing DNA and ""copying"" themselves.
* Ifosfamide is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die.

Study Groups:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on the likelihood that the surgery will be able to control the disease in the arm or leg that has the bone tumor(s).

Group 1 includes participants who are considered to have a ""standard"" chance that surgery will be able to control the disease in the arm or leg, participants who will have an amputation, or participants with cancer in areas other than in an arm or leg at the time of diagnosis.

Group 2 includes participants who are considered to have a ""higher"" chance that the tumor(s) will be left behind after having surgery that the doctor considers as ""incomplete"" to control the disease.

Central Venous Line:

For drugs to be given by vein, your study doctor will likely recommend that you have a central venous line (CVL) placed. A central venous line is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure.

Pre-Surgery Chemotherapy for Group 1:

Before surgery, Group 1 participants will receive doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate followed by leucovorin. Leucovorin is given to help prevent and/or treat the side effects that methotrexate may cause. Dexrazoxane is used to decrease the risk of side effects to the heart that doxorubicin may cause. These drugs will be given in an outpatient clinic (without requiring hospitalization), if possible.

Doxorubicin will be given by vein over 15 minutes, after dexrazoxane by vein over 15 minutes, on Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 6.

Cisplatin will be given as a continuous infusion by vein over 48 hours, on Days 1 and 2 of Weeks 1 and 6.

Methotrexate will be given by vein, over 4 hours, on Day 1 of Weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10. If you have difficulty recovering from the effects of the methotrexate therapy, you may only receive methotrexate twice before surgery, instead of 4 times.

Leucovorin will be given by vein, over 5 minutes, on the day after each methotrexate dose and then by mouth every 6 hours after that, until the study doctor believes that the methotrexate level in the blood is low. The methotrexate level in the blood will be checked using a blood test (less than 2 teaspoons each time). This test will be performed once a day after each methotrexate infusion, until the methotrexate blood level is low and it is considered safe to stop the leucovorin.

Pre-Surgery Chemotherapy for Group 2:

Before surgery, Group 2 participants will receive dexrazoxane, doxorubicin, and cisplatin.

On Day 1 of Weeks 1, 4, and 7, dexrazoxane will be given by vein over 15 minutes, followed by doxorubicin given by vein over 15 minutes and then cisplatin through an artery over 4 hours. Infusion through an artery requires a hospital stay of 2-4 days.

Surgery:

For all eligible study participants, the surgery to remove the tumor(s) will be performed on either Week 11 or 12. The surgery will be explained to you in detail, and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form for it that will describe its risks.

Before surgery, you will have routine visits with the surgeon. You will have several routine scans performed to help plan the surgery.

Chemotherapy Regimens after Surgery:

After the surgery (on or around Week 14), you will receive additional ""post-surgery"" chemotherapy.

After surgery, if you were originally in Group 1, and if the doctor believes the tumor(s) have responded well enough (specifically, if 90% or more of the tumor cells are dead when checked under the microscope), you will receive additional chemotherapy that is similar to what you received before surgery. This is described below as Regimen A. If the doctor does not believe the tumor(s) have responded well enough (if less than 90% of the tumor cells are dead when checked under the microscope), however, you will be assigned to Regimen B.

All participants who started in Group 2 will be assigned to Regimen B.

Radiation and Chemotherapy for Patients Ineligible for Routine Surgery:

A small number of participants on this study may need to have radiation therapy to help control the disease, as part of their routine care. This would only be done if the tumor(s) cannot be completely taken out with surgery, or if amputation is necessary but refused by the participant. If needed, and depending on where the tumor(s) are located, your doctor may decide that radiation is needed. All participants needing radiation or having surgery that the doctor considers as ""incomplete"" to control the disease are considered ""higher risk"" and will receive Regimen B therapy during and after radiation. (Radiation will usually begin during Weeks 12-14, but it could be anytime during ifosfamide therapy.) The radiation therapy will be explained to you in detail, and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form for it that will describe its risks.

Post-Surgery Chemotherapy for Regimen A:

Regimen A includes the following treatments:

* Methotrexate will be given over 4 hours on Day 1 of Weeks 14, 15, 19, 20, 24, 25, 29, and 30.
* Doxorubicin will be given on Day 1 of Weeks 16, 21, and 26.
* Cisplatin will be given as a continuous infusion by vein over 48 hours, on Days 1 and 2 of Weeks 16, 21, and 26.
* Leucovorin will be given by vein, over 5 minutes, on the day after each methotrexate dose and then by mouth every 6 hours after that, until the study doctor believes that the methotrexate level in the blood is low. The methotrexate level in the blood will be checked using a blood test (less than 2 teaspoons each time). This test will be performed once a day after each methotrexate infusion, until the methotrexate blood level is low and it is considered safe to stop the leucovorin.

Post-Surgery Chemotherapy for Regimen B:

Regimen B includes the following treatments:

* Methotrexate will be given over 4 hours on Day 1 of Weeks 14, 15, 20, 21, 26, 27, 32, 33, 38, and 39.
* Leucovorin will be given by vein, over 5 minutes, on the day after each methotrexate dose and then by mouth every 6 hours after that, until the study doctor believes that the methotrexate level in the blood is low. The methotrexate level in the blood will be checked using a blood test (less than 2 teaspoons each time). This test will be performed once a day after each methotrexate infusion, until the methotrexate blood level is low and it is considered safe to stop the leucovorin.
* Ifosfamide will be given by vein, continuously over 5 days each time, on Weeks 16, 22, 28, and 34.
* Mesna will be given by vein, continuously over 6 days each time, on Weeks 16, 22, 28, and 34. Mesna is used to decrease the risk of bleeding in the bladder and kidneys while ifosfamide is taken.

Study Tests:

After Week 5 of treatment, and then again before surgery, you will have the following tests performed:

* Your medical history will be reviewed.
* You will have a physical exam.
* Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be collected for routine tests and tests of your kidney and liver function. The routine blood tests may be repeated more often during the weeks you are receiving any of the study drugs.

If you are receiving cisplatin, you may have a hearing test performed before each dose of this drug.

You will have an ECHO performed before your fourth dose of doxorubicin on Week 14, and possibly more often if necessary.

Questionnaires:

You will be asked to complete 5 brief questionnaires on 5 different days during this study. The questionnaires ask about the health-related quality of your life, and include questions about how you have felt, physically and emotionally, during cancer treatment. The questionnaires also ask how you and your family have adapted to your having cancer treatments, and what effects the medicines may have had on whether you have felt healthy or sick.

These questionnaires will be completed at Week 1, at about Week 7 (before surgery or radiation), sometime during Weeks 20-22, at the end-of-treatment visit (either the end-of-Regimen-A visit, the end-of-Regimen-B visit, or the end-of-treatment visit), and 1 year after your first diagnosis of cancer. It should take you about 15-20 minutes to fill out the questionnaires each time.

External Care:

If the study doctor allows and you agree, some of the blood tests in this study may be performed outside of M. D. Anderson. The study doctor will discuss this option with you, if applicable.

Length of Study Participation:

If the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur, you will be taken off study.

End-of-Regimen-A Visit, End-of-Regimen-B Visit, or End-of-Treatment Visit:

If you complete Regimen A or B as planned or you leave the study early for any reason, the following procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam.
* Urine and blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tests of your kidney and liver function.
* You will have an ECHO, x-rays of the disease area and the chest, CT scans of the chest, and a bone scan.
* You will also have whole-body scans and a hearing test.

Follow-Up Visits:

After the end-of-Regimen-A visit, the end-of-Regimen-B visit, or the end-of-treatment visit, you will be asked to return for follow-up visits. At these visits, the following procedures will be performed:

* CT scans of the chest will be performed every 3 months for the first year after your chemotherapy ends, every 4 months for the 2nd year, every 6 months for the 3rd year, and once a year for the next 2 years.
* You will have a bone scan every year for 5 years.

This is an investigational study. All of the drugs used in this study are commercially available and commonly used in osteosarcoma. This study is designed to look at the drugs' use in the outpatient setting, which is considered research.

The drugs and schedules will vary depending on the status of the cancer and its level of risk for spreading, but they will include combinations of doxorubicin (non-liposomal), cisplatin, methotrexate, and ifosfamide, as described below. The Study Drugs: The standard treatment combination used to treat patients with osteosarcoma is doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate with or without ifosfamide. When this treatment combination is given in the hospital, it can require around 18-22 hospital stays. Somewhat recently, chemotherapy for osteosarcoma has become possible to give in the outpatient clinic. Researchers want to learn if giving 4 certain drugs (the combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate with or without ifosfamide) in the outpatient setting to eligible patients will help to decrease the number of hospital stays. During this study, all study participants whose tumor(s) can be taken out with surgery will be offered routine surgery to remove the tumor(s). After surgery, if the doctor believes the tumor(s) have responded well enough, the standard treatment combination is again doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate. If the tumor(s) have not responded well enough, however, the standard treatment combination is methotrexate and ifosfamide. In this study, participants are considered at ""higher risk"" for the tumor(s) spreading to the lungs in the following cases: if the participant's tumor(s) are large at the time of joining this study, if the cancer has spread to other organs, and/or if standard chemotherapy in this study has not killed enough tumor cells. The following drugs are used in this study: * Doxorubicin is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die. * Cisplatin has an atom at its center that contains a type of metal called platinum. The platinum is supposed to poison the cancer cells. * Methotrexate is designed to disrupt cells (including cancer cells) from making and repairing DNA and ""copying"" themselves. * Ifosfamide is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die. Study Groups: If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on the likelihood that the surgery will be able to control the disease in the arm or leg that has the bone tumor(s). Group 1 includes participants who are considered to have a ""standard"" chance that surgery will be able to control the disease in the arm or leg, participants who will have an amputation, or participants with cancer in areas other than in an arm or leg at the time of diagnosis. Group 2 includes participants who are considered to have a ""higher"" chance that the tumor(s) will be left behind after having surgery that the doctor considers as ""incomplete"" to control the disease. Central Venous Line: For drugs to be given by vein, your study doctor will likely recommend that you have a central venous line (CVL) placed. A central venous line is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this procedure. Pre-Surgery Chemotherapy for Group 1: Before surgery, Group 1 participants will receive doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate followed by leucovorin. Leucovorin is given to help prevent and/or treat the side effects that methotrexate may cause. Dexrazoxane is used to decrease the risk of side effects to the heart that doxorubicin may cause. These drugs will be given in an outpatient clinic (without requiring hospitalization), if possible. Doxorubicin will be given by vein over 15 minutes, after dexrazoxane by vein over 15 minutes, on Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 6. Cisplatin will be given as a continuous infusion by vein over 48 hours, on Days 1 and 2 of Weeks 1 and 6. Methotrexate will be given by vein, over 4 hours, on Day 1 of Weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10. If you have difficulty recovering from the effects of the methotrexate therapy, you may only receive methotrexate twice before surgery, instead of 4 times. Leucovorin will be given by vein, over 5 minutes, on the day after each methotrexate dose and then by mouth every 6 hours after that, until the study doctor believes that the methotrexate level in the blood is low. The methotrexate level in the blood will be checked using a blood test (less than 2 teaspoons each time). This test will be performed once a day after each methotrexate infusion, until the methotrexate blood level is low and it is considered safe to stop the leucovorin. Pre-Surgery Chemotherapy for Group 2: Before surgery, Group 2 participants will receive dexrazoxane, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. On Day 1 of Weeks 1, 4, and 7, dexrazoxane will be given by vein over 15 minutes, followed by doxorubicin given by vein over 15 minutes and then cisplatin through an artery over 4 hours. Infusion through an artery requires a hospital stay of 2-4 days. Surgery: For all eligible study participants, the surgery to remove the tumor(s) will be performed on either Week 11 or 12. The surgery will be explained to you in detail, and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form for it that will describe its risks. Before surgery, you will have routine visits with the surgeon. You will have several routine scans performed to help plan the surgery. Chemotherapy Regimens after Surgery: After the surgery (on or around Week 14), you will receive additional ""post-surgery"" chemotherapy. After surgery, if you were originally in Group 1, and if the doctor believes the tumor(s) have responded well enough (specifically, if 90% or more of the tumor cells are dead when checked under the microscope), you will receive additional chemotherapy that is similar to what you received before surgery. This is described below as Regimen A. If the doctor does not believe the tumor(s) have responded well enough (if less than 90% of the tumor cells are dead when checked under the microscope), however, you will be assigned to Regimen B. All participants who started in Group 2 will be assigned to Regimen B. Radiation and Chemotherapy for Patients Ineligible for Routine Surgery: A small number of participants on this study may need to have radiation therapy to help control the disease, as part of their routine care. This would only be done if the tumor(s) cannot be completely taken out with surgery, or if amputation is necessary but refused by the participant. If needed, and depending on where the tumor(s) are located, your doctor may decide that radiation is needed. All participants needing radiation or having surgery that the doctor considers as ""incomplete"" to control the disease are considered ""higher risk"" and will receive Regimen B therapy during and after radiation. (Radiation will usually begin during Weeks 12-14, but it could be anytime during ifosfamide therapy.) The radiation therapy will be explained to you in detail, and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form for it that will describe its risks. Post-Surgery Chemotherapy for Regimen A: Regimen A includes the following treatments: * Methotrexate will be given over 4 hours on Day 1 of Weeks 14, 15, 19, 20, 24, 25, 29, and 30. * Doxorubicin will be given on Day 1 of Weeks 16, 21, and 26. * Cisplatin will be given as a continuous infusion by vein over 48 hours, on Days 1 and 2 of Weeks 16, 21, and 26. * Leucovorin will be given by vein, over 5 minutes, on the day after each methotrexate dose and then by mouth every 6 hours after that, until the study doctor believes that the methotrexate level in the blood is low. The methotrexate level in the blood will be checked using a blood test (less than 2 teaspoons each time). This test will be performed once a day after each methotrexate infusion, until the methotrexate blood level is low and it is considered safe to stop the leucovorin. Post-Surgery Chemotherapy for Regimen B: Regimen B includes the following treatments: * Methotrexate will be given over 4 hours on Day 1 of Weeks 14, 15, 20, 21, 26, 27, 32, 33, 38, and 39. * Leucovorin will be given by vein, over 5 minutes, on the day after each methotrexate dose and then by mouth every 6 hours after that, until the study doctor believes that the methotrexate level in the blood is low. The methotrexate level in the blood will be checked using a blood test (less than 2 teaspoons each time). This test will be performed once a day after each methotrexate infusion, until the methotrexate blood level is low and it is considered safe to stop the leucovorin. * Ifosfamide will be given by vein, continuously over 5 days each time, on Weeks 16, 22, 28, and 34. * Mesna will be given by vein, continuously over 6 days each time, on Weeks 16, 22, 28, and 34. Mesna is used to decrease the risk of bleeding in the bladder and kidneys while ifosfamide is taken. Study Tests: After Week 5 of treatment, and then again before surgery, you will have the following tests performed: * Your medical history will be reviewed. * You will have a physical exam. * Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be collected for routine tests and tests of your kidney and liver function. The routine blood tests may be repeated more often during the weeks you are receiving any of the study drugs. If you are receiving cisplatin, you may have a hearing test performed before each dose of this drug. You will have an ECHO performed before your fourth dose of doxorubicin on Week 14, and possibly more often if necessary. Questionnaires: You will be asked to complete 5 brief questionnaires on 5 different days during this study. The questionnaires ask about the health-related quality of your life, and include questions about how you have felt, physically and emotionally, during cancer treatment. The questionnaires also ask how you and your family have adapted to your having cancer treatments, and what effects the medicines may have had on whether you have felt healthy or sick. These questionnaires will be completed at Week 1, at about Week 7 (before surgery or radiation), sometime during Weeks 20-22, at the end-of-treatment visit (either the end-of-Regimen-A visit, the end-of-Regimen-B visit, or the end-of-treatment visit), and 1 year after your first diagnosis of cancer. It should take you about 15-20 minutes to fill out the questionnaires each time.

More specifically, the investigators will study the effects of two different food oils/fats that are commonly consumed to determine if one is more effective in limiting maternal inflammation during pregnancy. You are being asked to take part in this study because it will help us update and make the best dietary recommendations for pregnant women and women of child bearing ages.","Pregnant women will be asked to consume dietary supplements (2 capsules, from the Pennington Biomedical Pharmacy) each day during pregnancy. They will begin taking the capsules around 17 weeks of pregnancy and take them each day until their babies are born. Women will be randomized to one of two groups. Randomization means they will be put into a group by chance, similar to flipping a coin. One group, the placebo group of the study, will take capsules containing oil '1 ' which is a mixture of corn and soy oils . The other group, the supplement group, will take capsules containing oil '2' which is an algal oil. Both oils are found in our diets. Neither the subject nor the study staff will know which group women are in.

Women will also keep a diary of how many capsules they take. At around 17, 22, 24, 26, 30, 32, and 36 weeks of pregnancy, women will go to Woman's Hospital to get new capsules and return any remaining capsules and their capsule diary. If they are not able to go to Woman's Hospital at weeks 22, 26, or 32 a researcher will arrange to meet them at an agreed upon prearranged place, such as a pharmacy, a library, or Pennington Biomedical, for example. At the same visits to Woman's Hospital at weeks 17, 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy women will also have their blood drawn (approximately one tablespoon).

At 17, 22, 24, 26, 30, 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy we will also ask women about the foods they are eating. We will do this by a prearranged phone call; women will not need to meet us in person for this.

Researchers will contact subjects weekly by phone to inquire about compliance with consumption of capsules. Contact will only take place during weeks in which a visit or phone call regarding diet is not required.

At 17, 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy small blood samples will be collected from their arm (approximately one tablespoon at each collection) for laboratory analyses. At the birth of their baby a sample of blood will be collected from the umbilical cord after their baby is delivered. All blood samples will be stored at Pennington Biomedical. Blood samples will be analyzed by the researchers who are involved in the study. Some analyses will take place at Pennington Biomedical and Louisiana State University (LSU). Deidentified (without subject names) samples will be sent to study researchers at Northeastern University in Boston, LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, and DSM Nutritional Products in Columbia, Maryland for some of the analyses. At the end of the study remaining blood samples will be discarded unless women consent for their blood to be used for future research. Should women decide to withdraw from the study, any samples collected thus far will be included in the study since they will be deidentified and the investigators will not know which samples belong to each person. We will also collect information about the baby's birth weight, length, and health from the baby's hospital chart.

When the baby is 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months of age we will measure the baby's body fat and lean tissue. To do this measurement the baby will lie or sit in an enclosed chamber where the mother can see her baby during the measurements. There are no attachments made to the baby. At these times we will also determine the baby's body fat by measuring the thickness of the baby's skinfold; this is done by gently lifting a double fold of skin on the baby's hip, upper arm (triceps), and back of the thigh and measuring the thickness of that fold with a handheld instrument with two hinged arms that fit over the skinfold. There is no discomfort associated with this procedure. The measurements will be made at Woman's Hospital. During these visits we will also ask questions about how the mother is feeding her baby. Between these visits (when the baby is 2, 4, 8, and 10 months old) we will phone to ask about how the baby is being fed and to inquire about the mother's and baby's well-being.","Inclusion Criteria:

Participants with PD will be assigned one of three treatments delivered over 8-weeks: exoskeleton exercise (experimental intervention), non-exoskeleton exercise (active comparator), and wait-list control (no treatment).","Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a movement disorder that significantly impairs mobility and increases risk of falls. Many people with PD also experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and some progress to Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Non-pharmacologic treatments such as physical activity and exercise are known to be neuroprotective and may improve cognition, mood and overall functioning in PD, but such interventions can be challenging for individuals with PD and cognitive impairment to fully participate in. Robotic over-ground exoskeletons have the potential to overcome this barrier; however there are no scientific data yet to support the use robotic exoskeletons in the PD population or those with mood disorder and/or declining cognitive function.

This therapeutic exploratory trial will fill this gap in knowledge and provide critical data for understanding how to integrate exoskeletons into clinical practice for age-related movement disorders when cognitive decline is present. Specifically we will test if an 8-week functional exercise program (gait, balance, aerobic exercise) using the KEEOGO Rehab(tm) exoskeleton can improve mood and cognition, as well as gait and balance, compared to the same functional exercise without using the exoskeleton, and a wait-list control (no treatment).","Inclusion Criteria:

Southern California College of Optometry at Marshall B. Ketchum University,OTHER,NCT00553579,The Relationship of Residence Time and Visual Effect of Optive and Systane in Dry Eye Subjects,The Relationship of Residence Time and Visual Effect of Optive and Systane in Dry Eye Subjects,"The benefits of artificial tears to relieve dry eye symptoms include, but are not limited to: stabilizing the tear film layer, fluid supplement action, improving visual acuity, and comfort. Studies have found a relationship between some of these benefits. For example, stabilization of the tear film is important not only to increase the tear break up time (TBUT), but is key in improving and maintaining visual acuity. These studies have alluded to the fact that there may or may not be a relationship between residence time and visual performance. Viscosity is one reason behind the uncertainty. Some solutions contain polymers which influence the ocular surface when contacted. This can impact residence time and ultimately visual performance. No prior research has explored the direct relationship between residence time and visual performance.

Residence time refers to the duration at which the artificial tear resides on the eye. Methods have been developed to assess residence time by admixing fluorescent tracers to the solution and then measuring the amount of fluorescence over time. The caveat to methods using certain tracers has lead to uncertainty in elimination measurements due to corneal penetration or differing molecular weights (MW) from the active vehicle ingredient in the solution. For example, low-MW tracers can be eliminated at a different rate than higher-MW polymers. In addition, the low-MW tracers may be able to penetrate the corneal epithelium giving a false pre-corneal residence time. Meadows, Paugh, Joshi, and Mordaunt addressed this issue by developing a technique using a polymer which did not penetrate the cornea and had the same MW as the active ingredient in the solution FITC-dextran. Based on the assumption that similar weights are eliminated at the same rate, this technique has shown to be more economic, manageable, and amendable than previous procedures measuring residence time.

Any ophthalmic drop has the potential to impact visual acuity upon instillation due to the effect it has on the tear layer components. Studies have observed that taking artificial tears continuously over time tends to stabilize the tear layer thus minimizing the immediate drop in contrast sensitivity upon instillation. Measuring the visual effect of artificial tears, using contrast sensitivity as a measure, provides valuable information about the therapeutic effect of artificial tears that are meant to stabilize the tear film, thus improving visual acuity in dry eye patients.

But what about the patient? There is a difference between residence time and retention of effect- which is often what matters the most for patients. Retention of effect refers to the beneficial effect of the drop. Currently there is no real measure of retention of effect. Doctors can assess the tear film objectively, but there have been no strong correlations between subjective dry symptoms and tear film stability. A possible reason for the lack of correlation may be due to the fact that subjectivity is difficult to quantify. However, scales like the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) have been established in an attempt to quantify subjective experiences such as visual quality. We will be using the NRS to gauge the comfort of the drop upon the initial application to get a general idea of the comfort the drop provides to the user.

Although there have been several studies done on residence time and visual effect of ophthalmic formulations separately, there is no current research correlating these two aspects of therapeutic efficacy. This study will be the first to concurrently investigate residence time (using FITC-dextran) and visual effect of an ophthalmic formulation.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Centre Henri Becquerel,OTHER,NCT01833884,Kinetic of Cytokines Decrease and Hodgkin Lymphoma Prognostic,Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Prognostic Value of the Kinetic of Decrease of 5 Cytokines Concentration During Treatment,"More than 90% of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) can recover thanks to conventional polychemotherapy regimens - ABVD or BEACOPP - with or without radiotherapy. Nevertheless, some patients relapse and others are resistant to any treatment. These patients represent 2-5% of stage I / II and 5-10% of disseminated stages. The usual prognostic index based on clinical and biological data (supradiaphragmatic HL: EORTC and advanced HL International Prognostic Score) cannot always detect patients at risk.

New prognostic factors are required to screen out these high risk patients. Among available biological factors, we will retain the cytokines secreted by tumor cells and cells from the environment.

Indeed, the prognostic value of plasma cytokines levels and their soluble receptors has recently been described by at least two teams. Olivier CASASNOVAS set up a prognostic index based on quantities of IL-1 RA, IL-6, sCD30 and TNFR1 at diagnosis,and the V. Diehl team published the prognostic value of the decrease of TARC (CC Thymus and Activation-related chemokine).

In daily practice, the early assessment of response by PET CT-scan is now an undeniable prognostic factor. Early identification of no-response or relapse is, in fact, based on clinical and imaging (PET-CT scan).

We propose to evaluate the decrease of cytokines concentration with a prognostic value (TARC, IL-6, IL1-RA, sCD30, TNFR1) as markers of response during treatment and during early follow-up. The dosage of these cytokines will be paired with radiological assessments.

A correlation between the decrease of cytokines plasma levels overtime and event-free survival will be searched afterwards.","To evaluate the decrease of cytokines concentration with a prognostic value as markers of response, the dosage of TARC, IL-6, IL1-RA, sCD30 and TNFR1 will be performed during treatment at :diagnosis, cycle 1 day 15, cycle 2 Day 1, cycle 3 Day 1, Day 1 of consolidation (Cycle 5 day 1 or before radiotherapy) and evaluation of end of treatment.

King's College London,OTHER,NCT03178279,The Evaluation of the Use of a New Physical Health Plan,An Evaluation of the Use of a Physical Health Plan With People With Psychosis,"People suffering from psychotic illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia) have poorer physical health than the general population. The reasons include a lack of service user motivation to attend physical health checks and the tendency of health professionals to focus mainly on the mental disorder thus delaying the detection of physical health conditions.

Identifying people who have physical health needs is increasingly recognised as a priority. The investigators have developed a Physical Health Plan (PHP) which is completed by service users and identifies areas of physical health need. An action plan is then completed by the service user and care co-ordinator to address these issues.

The PHP is designed to be very simple to use and there will be 3 versions, 1. paper version, 2. 1 version implemented via the 'IMPARTS' computerised 'tablet' based system that has been separately evaluated (REC Ref 12/SC/0422) and 3. 1 version on an iPad via the MHL2 system via Mindwaves.

The investigators wish to pilot the use of this PHP in two community teams in the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) Trust. The pilot will be done in three stages.

Stage One: The investigators will undertake an initial qualitative study to refine the process of using the PHP using focus group consultations with staff and service users.

Stage Two: The investigators will then undertake a six month study to evaluate the uptake and use of the PHP. This will involve collecting data on how many people complete the PHP and what actions are taken following the completion of the PHP.

Stage Three: At the end of this six month period the investigators will undertake qualitative interviews with a selection of service users and staff to understand their experience of using the PHP.

The investigators hope to be able to use the results of this pilot study to introduce the use of the PHP into routine care.","The PHP is designed to be very simple to use and there will be 3 versions, 1. paper version, 2. 1 version implemented via the 'IMPARTS' computerised 'tablet' based system that has been separately evaluated (REC Ref 12/SC/0422) and 3. 1 version on an iPad via the Healthlocker system via Mindwaves.

Researchers also want to learn if one of these drugs is more effective than the other at controlling side effects.,"The Study Drugs:

Atorvastatin is designed to lower cholesterol by blocking its production in the liver. This may help to decrease the chances of having a heart attack or a stroke.

Fish oil supplements are designed to lower fat levels in the blood by blocking their production in the liver. This may help to decrease the chances of having a heart attack or a stroke.

Atorvastatin is FDA-approved and commercially available for lowering cholesterol or fat levels in the blood. Fish oil supplements are also commercially available.

Researchers want to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of Atorvastatin and fish oil supplements.

Study Groups:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study ""Part"" based on when you join this study. Up to 132 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study. Up to 120 participants will be enrolled in Part 2 of the study.

If you are enrolled in Part 1, you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 3 groups. You will be provided with enough unmarked capsules for fourteen days plus a test dose. You will take the test dose in the clinic in the presence of the research nurse. Beginning 5 days before lung surgery (Day -5), you will take 1 capsule in the morning, as well as 3 capsules 2 time each day (a total of 7 unmarked capsules each day) for 5 days. The capsules should be taken with a cup (8 ounces) of water and may be taken with or without food. You will be reminded by the research nurse to bring the remaining capsules from home prior to your admission for surgery.

* If you are in Group 1, the capsules you will take will be fish oil supplements and placebo. A placebo is a substance that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredients.
* If you are in Group 2, the capsules you will take will be atorvastatin and placebo.
* If you are in Group 3, the capsules you will take will be placebo only.

You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group. Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.

After Part 1 is complete, the groups will be compared to learn if any group was more effective than the others. If neither fish oil supplements nor atorvastatin is shown to be more effective than the placebo, the study will be stopped. If fish oil or atorvastatin is found to be more effective than the placebo, the study will continue to Part 2.

If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study groups. You will be provided with enough unmarked capsules for fourteen days plus a test dose. You will take the test dose in the clinic in the presence of the research nurse, and begin taking capsules 5 days before surgery (Day -5) for 5 days. If atorvastatin was found to be the more effective drug in Part 1, you will take 1 unmarked capsule in the morning each day. If fish oil was found to be the more effective drug in Part 1, you will take 3 capsules 2 times each day (a total of 6 unmarked capsules each day). The capsules should be taken with a cup (8 ounces) of water and may be taken with or without food.

You will be reminded by the research nurse to bring the remaining capsules from home prior to admission for surgery.

* If you are in Group 1, the capsules you will take will be the drug that was found to be more effective in Part 1 (either fish oil supplements or atorvastatin).
* If you are in Group 2, the capsules you will take will be placebo only.

You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each group. Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.

Surgery:

After you have taken the study drug/placebo for 5 days, you will have standard of care lung surgery performed. You will be given a separate consent form to read and sign for the surgery.

On the day of surgery, any unused capsules will be collected and the days, times, and reasons why any doses were missed will be recorded. You will then continue taking the study drug/placebo for up to 9 days after surgery or until you are released from the hospital (whichever comes first). You will follow the same dosing schedule you followed before surgery.

Study Visits:

Each day while you are in the hospital, your vital signs will be measured and you will be checked for any allergic reaction you may have had to the study drug/placebo.

On Days 1 and 3, and on the last day that you take the study drug/placebo, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your liver function.

About 4-6 weeks after surgery, you will have a follow-up visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.
* You will be asked about any symptoms and/or side effects you may have had.
* Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check your liver function.

Length of Study:

You will take the study drug/placebo for 5 days before surgery, and for up to 9 days after surgery (up to a total of 14 days). Your participation in the study will be over after the follow-up visit. You will be taken off study early if you have intolerable side effects (such as allergic reaction or abnormal liver function tests).

Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse.The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse.,"Background: Intimate partner abuse is very common among university students. Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse. An intervention with evidence-based applications to post-traumatic stress caused by intimate partner abuse and posttraumatic growth, using web-based applications that young people are familiar with, is considered important in order to protect the physical-mental health of university students, to increase their academic success, and to ensure that they establish healthy intimate partner relationships in the future.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse.

Methods: The randomized controlled study that did not use blinding employed a 2x5 split-plot design. The universe of the study consisted of 371 student nurses. Students who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: experimental (n=17) and control (n=18). The internet-based psychosocial intervention, which was based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, was delivered individually and electronically to the students in the experimental group in eight sessions, each lasting up to 120 minutes, using videoconferencing. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PGTI) were used to measure the outcomes at the pre-test, post-test, 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up.

Discussion: The internet-based psychosocial intervention was found to be effective in reducing post-traumatic stress and experiencing post-traumatic growth in student nurses who had been exposed to partner violence with these positive effects lasting for six months. This study is one of the first web-based randomized controlled studies to address post-traumatic stress and growth together in university students who were exposed to intimate partner violence. It is hoped that the results of the study will guide the research to be carried out in this context by internet intervention in the future.

Adverse effects will be reviewed at each visit and standardized measures of depression will be conducted at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16.","Inclusion Criteria:

1. Age 18-45 years.
2. Diagnosis of DS confirmed via genetic testing or a clinical diagnosis made by a clinician with significant experience treating patients with DS.
3. Diagnosis of major depressive disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria, confirmed through the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5).
4. Moderately severe depression as evidenced by a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of 20 or greater at Screen and Baseline. A severity score on the MADRS was chosen as an inclusion criterion since it has been demonstrated to be sensitive to change in adults with MDD.
5. A Clinical Global Impression Severity Item score \> 4 (moderate) for depression symptoms at Screen and Baseline.

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Active primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or substance use disorder. These disorders are exclusionary since the primary treatment of these disorders may require acute psychosocial or medication treatments that would confound the assessments used in this study. We will evaluate for these disorders using the corresponding SCID-5 modules.
2. Current or previous diagnosis of dementia, or use of medication to treat dementia. Given the potential overlap between depression and dementia symptoms, we want to ensure we are administering fluoxetine to patients with a diagnosis of depression.
3. Presence of any past or present conditions that would make treatment with fluoxetine unsafe. This includes allergy to fluoxetine, liver or kidney disease, unstable heart disease, and/or pregnancy (or being sexually active without using acceptable methods to prevent pregnancy).
4. Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), bupropion, mirtazapine, antipsychotics, lithium, valproic acid, or carbamazepine. Subjects will need to be off these classes of medications for at least 5 elimination half-lives prior to beginning the trial.
5. Use of other psychotropic medications which are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or sub-optimal in terms of dose. A board-certified psychiatrist will assess any other psychotropic medications being used and determine whether they are effective, tolerated, and optimal in terms of dose. If medications are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or sub-optimal in terms of dose, the study psychiatrist will work with the subject and his/her treatment team to either taper or optimize the dose of psychotropic medications prior to study enrollment.

Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of melanoma and other cancers. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sodium stibogluconate and interferon alfa-2b together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sodium stibogluconate when given together with interferon alfa-2b, cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine in treating patients with advanced melanoma or other cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the safety of the combination of sodium stibogluconate and interferon alfa-2b with chemotherapy.
* To confirm the activity of sodium stibogluconate in augmenting cytokine effects.

Secondary

* To quantify the effects of sodium stibogluconate on interferon alfa-2b induced gene modulation and signal transduction pathways by measuring the serum soluble gene products.
* To define the effectiveness of sodium stibogluconate in inhibiting the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 assayed from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients receiving sodium stibogluconate in combination with interferon alfa-2b.
* To define the pharmacokinetics of sodium stibogluconate in serum at escalating doses.
* To assess clinical response to the combination of sodium stibogluconate and interferon alfa-2b as priming for combination chemotherapy.

OUTLINE:

* Course 1: Patients receive sodium stibogluconate IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and days 15-18; interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 8-12 and 15-18; cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and vinblastine IV on days 19 and 20; and dacarbazine. After a 2-week rest period, patients proceed to course 2.
* Course 2 and all subsequent courses: Patients receive sodium stibogluconate IV over 15 minutes and interferon alfa-2b SC on days 1-4; cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and vinblastine IV on days 5 and 6; dacarbazine. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\* NOTE: \*Patients with stage IV disease who have no evidence of disease \[NED} receive only 4 courses of therapy.

Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of sodium stibogluconate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which dose-limiting toxicity occurs (i.e., no more than 1 patient at a given dose experiences DLT).

Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for immunological and pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are analyzed for serum soluble gene products and protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition.","DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

* Histologically confirmed melanoma or other malignancies

  * Must be refractory or resistant to established treatments OR have metastatic disease for which no effective therapy has been established
  * Gliomas or controlled CNS metastasis allowed

Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of melanoma and other cancers. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sodium stibogluconate and interferon alfa-2b together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sodium stibogluconate when given together with interferon alfa-2b, cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine in treating patients with advanced melanoma or other cancer. OBJECTIVES: Primary * To determine the safety of the combination of sodium stibogluconate and interferon alfa-2b with chemotherapy. * To confirm the activity of sodium stibogluconate in augmenting cytokine effects. Secondary * To quantify the effects of sodium stibogluconate on interferon alfa-2b induced gene modulation and signal transduction pathways by measuring the serum soluble gene products. * To define the effectiveness of sodium stibogluconate in inhibiting the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 assayed from peripheral blood leukocytes of patients receiving sodium stibogluconate in combination with interferon alfa-2b. * To define the pharmacokinetics of sodium stibogluconate in serum at escalating doses. * To assess clinical response to the combination of sodium stibogluconate and interferon alfa-2b as priming for combination chemotherapy. OUTLINE: * Course 1: Patients receive sodium stibogluconate IV over 15 minutes on day 1 and days 15-18; interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 8-12 and 15-18; cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and vinblastine IV on days 19 and 20; and dacarbazine. After a 2-week rest period, patients proceed to course 2. * Course 2 and all subsequent courses: Patients receive sodium stibogluconate IV over 15 minutes and interferon alfa-2b SC on days 1-4; cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and vinblastine IV on days 5 and 6; dacarbazine. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\* NOTE: \*Patients with stage IV disease who have no evidence of disease \[NED} receive only 4 courses of therapy. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of sodium stibogluconate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which dose-limiting toxicity occurs (i.e., no more than 1 patient at a given dose experiences DLT). Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for immunological and pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are analyzed for serum soluble gene products and protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibition.

Wonju Severance Christian Hospital,OTHER,NCT01964079,Comparision of Blood Pressure Variability Between Amlodipine and Losartan,The COMPAriSon of Systolic Blood Pressure Variability and Central Blood Pressure of Calcium Channel Blocker (Amlodipine) in Comparison With Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (Losartan) in Patients With Essential Hypertension,"Blood pressure (BP) is believed to be a major determinant of vascular disease, and BP lowering is the most important goal in hypertension treatment. Thus, clinical guidelines for hypertension are mainly focused on lowering mean BP. However, despite an increasing incidence of stroke with age, the association between systolic BP (SBP) and the risk of stroke decreases with age. This disparity highlights a gap in the link between BP and vascular-related diseases (i.e., stroke). In clinical practice, visit-to-visit fluctuations in BP have been largely ignored and are thought to be an unreliable finding, even though this phenomenon is frequently observed. Rothwell et al. demonstrated that the visit-to-visit variability in SBP was a more powerful independent predictor of stroke than mean SBP, and that an increased residual variability in SBP in treated hypertensive patients was also a strong predictor of stroke and coronary events.

Recently updated (2011) hypertension guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) \[or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)\] and calcium-channel blocker (CCB) as a first line drug. Although the significance of BP variability (BPV) has been illustrated, the main focus of the current guidelines is to reduce systolic and diastolic BP, not BPV.

In the X-CELLENT study, a CCB (amlodipine) and thiazide-like diuretic drug (indapamide sustained-release) led to a significant reduction in BPV, compared to an ARB (candesartan). In addition, the CCB showed the most effective reduction in systolic BPV among the antihypertensive drug class in a meta-analysis. However, there are no direct comparison studies of a CCB and ARB on BPV. Thus, we aim to compare the systolic BPV effects of a CCB versus an ARB in essential hypertensive patients. The primary hypothesis is that an ARB is not inferior to a CCB in the reduction of the systolic BPV standard deviation (SD) in essential hypertensive patients.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Will outcomes observed in a high-risk operable transapical native valve TAVR cohort receiving an Edwards SAPIEN device compare to inoperable patients undergoing alternative access TAVR with the Edwards SAPIEN device experience a reasonably similar incidence of 30 day adverse events?","Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using the Edwards SAPIEN valve and Retroflex 3 delivery system provides both a mortality and quality of life benefit for inoperable patients. Only the transfemoral (TF) access has been approved in the US. A substantial number of patients cannot have a TF approach due to inadequate vessel size, vessel disease, or other anatomical considerations. The pivotal study did not include an assessment of safety and effectiveness of alternative access approaches in this inoperable patient group.

Early approaches to TAVR included a femoral transvenous approach with transseptal access to the left side for delivery of the valve. This approach avoided large bore arterial catheterization, but it had unacceptable rates of complications and lacked reproducibility. Alternative access approaches have been developed because of the risks associated with inserting large caliber catheters into small, diseased femoral arteries often associated with diffuse vasculopathy. To avoid the vascular complications from femoral access, other transcatheter approaches have been developed to include open surgical access to the left ventricular apex (TA), ascending aorta, (TAO), subclavian and axillary arteries (TS), and retroperitoneal access to the iliac artery (TI) as well as distal aorta. In addition to providing TAVR to patients who cannot have TF access, additional advantages include better catheter control and safer closure of the access site. Commonly cited disadvantages include the need for surgical expertise and additional equipment, along with the potential for longer recovery, more incisional pain, greater radiation exposure for operators, unsuitable delivery catheters for alternative access sites, and a host of unique alternative access site complications.

We propose to collectively analyze 30-day safety endpoints as a lumped data group for these alternative access approaches. These data are gathered from clinical practice in real-world settings and submitted to the TVT Registry. It is expected that centers will choose among the various choices for alternative access based the causative factors underlying the need for alternative access, as well as local skill sets and experience. For this lumped data group of alternative access approaches we will compare 30-day safety results to the TA outcomes reported from Cohort A of the PARTNERS 1 trial. We recognize that these TA patients were high risk operable patients rather than inoperable patients, but no other direct comparator group is available. We reason that the TA data from this published clinical trial are high quality, represent an alternative access approach rather than TF, and will provide a frequency of safety endpoints that have been found to be acceptable both clinically and from a regulatory perspective.","Inclusion Criteria:

Will outcomes observed in a high-risk operable transapical native valve TAVR cohort receiving an Edwards SAPIEN device compare to inoperable patients undergoing alternative access TAVR with the Edwards SAPIEN device experience a reasonably similar incidence of 30 day adverse events? Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using the Edwards SAPIEN valve and Retroflex 3 delivery system provides both a mortality and quality of life benefit for inoperable patients. Only the transfemoral (TF) access has been approved in the US. A substantial number of patients cannot have a TF approach due to inadequate vessel size, vessel disease, or other anatomical considerations. The pivotal study did not include an assessment of safety and effectiveness of alternative access approaches in this inoperable patient group. Early approaches to TAVR included a femoral transvenous approach with transseptal access to the left side for delivery of the valve. This approach avoided large bore arterial catheterization, but it had unacceptable rates of complications and lacked reproducibility. Alternative access approaches have been developed because of the risks associated with inserting large caliber catheters into small, diseased femoral arteries often associated with diffuse vasculopathy.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA),FED,NCT04310579,Clinical Study to Investigate the Effect of the Combination of Psychotropic Drugs and an Opioid on Ventilation,Clinical Study to Investigate the Effect of the Combination of Psychotropic Drugs and an Opioid on Ventilation,"Opioids can decrease breathing and co-administration of benzodiazepines with opioids can further decrease breathing. It is unknown whether certain other drugs also decrease breathing when co-administered with opioids. The objective of this study is to determine whether certain drugs combined with an opioid decrease breathing compared to breathing with an opioid alone.

In order to assess this, this study will utilize the Read Rebreathing method, where study participants breathe increased levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The increased levels of carbon dioxide cause the study participants to increase breathing. This increased breathing response can be decreased by opioids and benzodiazepines, and potentially other drugs. Using this procedure, low doses of opioids or benzodiazepines can be administered that have minimal-to-no effects on breathing when study participants are going about normal activities breathing room air, however breathing increases less than expected as carbon dioxide levels are increased. This study will also obtain quantitative pupillometry measurements before and after each rebreathing assessment to allow for comparisons of pupillary changes to ventilatory changes when subjects receive different drugs and drug combinations.

This study includes three parts: A Lead-In Reproducibility Phase and two main parts (Part 1 and Part 2). The Lead-In Reproducibility Phase will measure the variability between study participants and between repeated uses of the method in the same study participant within a day and between days. Part 1 will study an opioid alone, benzodiazepine alone, and their combination to show the methodology will detect changes in breathing at low doses of the drugs that are known to affect breathing. Part 2 will assess whether two drugs, selected due to their effects on breathing in a nonclinical model, decrease the breathing response when combined with an opioid compared to when an opioid is administered alone.","Opioids can cause respiratory/ventilatory depression, and this can be exacerbated when opioids are co-administered with benzodiazepines. Research suggests this is caused by a reduced respiratory/ventilatory response to counteract increasing levels of systemic carbon dioxide (CO2). It is unknown whether certain other sedative psychotropic drugs can exacerbate opioid-induced respiratory/ventilatory depression. Studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of selected drugs in a non-clinical model. This clinical study will evaluate two drugs (quetiapine and paroxetine) that caused an effect when combined with oxycodone in the non-clinical model.

Study designs were evaluated that would allow a safe and controlled assessment of the effects of drug combinations on respiratory/ventilatory depression and a methodology was selected called the Read breathing procedure which introduces increased levels of CO2 to cause study participants to increase ventilation by having study participants rebreathe through a circuit with 93% oxygen (O2) and 7% CO2. Previous studies have shown this ""hypercapnic ventilatory response"" can be decreased by opioids and benzodiazepines and potentially other drugs. Using this procedure, low doses of opioids or benzodiazepines can be administered that have minimal-to-no effects on respiration/ventilation when study participants are going about normal activities breathing room air, however ventilation is decreased relative to the expected increase in ventilation as CO2 levels are increased during rebreathing. Thus, there is minimal risk of true respiratory depression (i.e. inadequate gas exchange) and, if needed, the investigators can immediately halt the experiment and have the study participant breathe room air or 100% O2.

Using the Read rebreathing methodology, the current clinical study was designed to generate data characterizing changes in the ventilatory response to hypercapnia when administering quetiapine and paroxetine alone or in combination with oxycodone. Information obtained from this study will inform on the potential for the specific studied drugs to affect ventilation when combined with an opioid and may also demonstrate the utility of this study design and methodology as an approach for evaluating the effect of an investigational drug and drug combinations on ventilatory depression. Thus, this study includes a lead-in reproducibility phase to quantify the intra- and inter-subject variability within a day and between days. In addition, this study includes a positive control phase with relatively low doses of opioid (oxycodone) alone, benzodiazepine (midazolam) alone and their combination to help assess assay sensitivity. While opioids and benzodiazepines have been studied alone and in combination with the rebreathing method previously, many of these studies are older and it is important to define the reproducibility and effects of the drugs at relatively low doses. Together, these components of the study will further define the reproducibility and sensitivity of the methodology that could be applied to a broader range of investigational drugs in the future to assess their safety when combined with opioids.

In addition, pupillary measurements have been used to study the pharmacodynamic effects of opioids and opioid antagonists (Skulberg et al, 2018; Rollins et al, 2014) and there has been interest in expanding its use in clinical studies. However, there are limited data directly comparing pupillary changes to ventilatory changes and some drugs may influence the pupillary response to opioids (Kummer et al, 2011). As an exploratory endpoint, this study will obtain quantitative pupillometry measurements before and after each rebreathing assessment to allow for comparisons of pupillary changes to ventilatory changes when subjects receive different drugs and drug combinations.

This study includes three parts: A Lead-In Reproducibility Phase and two main parts (Part 1 and Part 2). The lead-in reproducibility phase will quantify the intra- and inter-subject variability of the Read Rebreathing methodology within a day and between days. Part 1 is a positive control phase with doses of an opioid (oxycodone) alone, benzodiazepine (midazolam) alone, their combination, and placebo to help assess ability of the procedure to detect changes in ventilation. Part 2 will assess whether two sedative psychotropic drugs (quetiapine and paroxetine), selected due to their effects in a nonclinical model, decrease the ventilatory response to hypercapnia compared to an opioid (oxycodone) alone. The doses of oxycodone and midazolam were selected to be less than those previously administered in healthy volunteers undergoing the Read Rebreathing or similar respiratory circuit procedures that increase the inspired level of CO2. The doses of quetiapine and paroxetine were selected to reach clinical steady-state levels.

The Lead-In Reproducibility Phase will have up to 10 healthy volunteer participants enrolled in two cohorts of approximately five. Participants will perform the Read Rebreathing procedure five times on day 1 and five times on day 2.

Part 1 will be a 4-period randomized crossover study with approximately 20 healthy volunteer participants. Participants will receive four different treatments (oxycodone, midazolam, oxycodone + midazolam, and placebo) in a random order across each of the 1-day study periods. There will be two days of washout between each period. During each period, participants will perform the Read Rebreathing procedure seven times, for a total of 28 rebreathing assessments in Part 1. For Part 1, blood samples will also be collected for determination of study drug concentration.

Part 2 will be a 3-period randomized crossover study with approximately 20 healthy volunteer participants. Participants will receive three different treatments (oxycodone, oxycodone + quetiapine, and oxycodone + paroxetine) in a random order across each of the 5-day periods. Oxycodone will only be administered on day 1 and day 5 of each treatment period. The other drugs will be administered every day of the treatment period such that there will be lower concentrations on day 1 and higher concentrations on day 5, which are the days when oxycodone is co-administered. Read Rebreathing assessments will be performed on day 1 and day 5 to investigate the effect of paroxetine and quetiapine when combined with oxycodone compared to oxycodone alone. In addition, Read Rebreathing assessments will be performed on day 4 to determine the effect of paroxetine alone and quetiapine alone compared to placebo. There will be seven days of washout between each period. During each period, participants will perform the Read Rebreathing procedure 17 times, for a total of 51 rebreathing assessments in Part 2. For Part 2, blood samples will also be collected for determination of study drug concentration.","Inclusion Criteria:

Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,OTHER,NCT01095679,Baclofen and Hypoxia-induced Periodic Ventilation,"Assessment of the Effect of the GABA-B Receptor Agonist, Baclofen, on Hypoxia-induced Periodic Ventilation, in Healthy Subjects","Periodic ventilation that includes CHEYNE Stokes ventilation is a pathological pattern characterized by alternating periods of hyperpneas and apnea-hypopneas. It occurs generally during sleep, at high altitude and in hypoxic conditions in healthy subjects, and in some diseases like congestive heart failure. One study conducted on an animal model suggested that baclofen, a drug already used against spasticity in humans, could also be effective against periodic ventilation. The goal of the study is therefore to assess this hypothesis on hypoxia-induced periodic ventilation in healthy subjects during sleep.","Rationale of the study:

Periodic ventilation, often called CHEYNE Stokes ventilation, results from a dysfunction of the mechanisms of the control of breathing. In this type of ventilation, alternating periods of hyperventilation and apneas and/or hypoventilation replace the normal regular pattern of breathing. Periodic ventilation occurs preferentially during sleep. It is responsible for decreases in arterial saturation in oxygen and for sleep fragmentation. There is currently no consensual treatment but non-invasive nocturnal mechanical ventilation is often used to bring the ventilatory pattern back to normal.

Periodic ventilation occurs in various conditions, the most frequent being cardiac failure. It also occurs in healthy subjects exposed to hypoxia or at high altitude.

The pathophysiology of periodic breathing remains poorly understood. Our hypothesis regarding the mechanisms of this abnormal ventilatory pattern is based on comparative physiology. Periodic ventilation is indeed the usual ventilatory pattern of many lower vertebrates. Moreover, even isolated in VITRO, the tadpole brainstem still produces a periodic ventilatory rhythm, characterized by clusters of ventilatory discharges. In this model, the agonist of the GABA-B receptor, the baclofen, transforms the periodic pattern into a regular one. Of note, the baclofen is already used in the treatment of some human diseases, especially against spasticity.

The hypothesis of the research project assumes that periodic ventilation in humans results from a neural reconfiguration of the networks that command breathing, leading them to produce an ancestral behavior. It also assumes that the baclofen woul reverse this phenomenon as it does in the model of the tadpole isolated brainstem.

The goal of the project is therefore to assess the effect of baclofen on hypoxia-induced periodic ventilation in healthy subjects during sleep. This is thus a pathophysiological study that aimed at demonstrating a concept before a possible clinical trial.

This study is pathophysiological study, conducted in healthy volunteers only.

Methods:

The subjects will sleep in hypoxic conditions, with a level of hypoxia similar to the one that is found at an altitude of 4000-4500 meters. A this altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen is approximately 90-100 mmHg. The hypoxic atmosphere will be created in a tent with an hypoxic generator (EVEREST Summit Hypoxic Generator, Hypoxic Systems, New York, NY, USA).

The electroencephalographic and electrocardiographic signals and the movements of the chest and of the abdomen will be recorded with a portable polysomnograph. The electromyogram of the chin and the ELECTRO Oculogram will also be recorded. These signals will permit to identify the sleep stages. The subjects will ware a face mask connected to a pneumotachometer for the recording of the ventilatory flow. Gas will also be sampled to measure the end tidal partial pressure of CO2.

Protocol:

Healthy volunteers will be enrolled after they will have given written informed consent. The subjects will be asked about their medical history and physical examination will be performed. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and pulmonary function tests will also be performed.

The subject will be asked not to sleep the night before each recording in hypoxic conditions (the hypoxic sessions). The recordings will be performed either during a nap in the afternoon or at night.

A first hypoxic session will be performed to identify the subjects who will develop periodic ventilation. Only those who will exhibit periodic ventilation during sleep will continue the study. They will be prescribed either baclofen or placebo (double blind, randomized). The posology will be progressively increased (over approximately 10 days) to reach 20 mg 3 times a day, during 3 to 5 days. A second hypoxic session will be performed under this treatment. Then the posology will be decreased over 3 days and a complete weaning will be performed during 5 to 10 days. The same protocol will be repeated, either with baclofen or placebo (depending of the previous run) and a third hypoxic session will be performed. The posology will then be decreased over 3 days and the study will be considered ended for the subject after 2 more days of complete weaning.

The maximum duration of the study for one subject will be 63 days.","Inclusion Criteria:

The worldwide spread of resistance to antibiotics among Gram-negative bacteria, particularly members of the ESKAPE group of pathogens, has resulted in a crisis in the treatment of hospital acquired infections. In particular, the recent dissemination of a serine carbapenemase (e.g., KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in US hospitals now poses a considerable threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial agents. Rempex is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of a carbapenem (RPX2014) plus a new beta-lactamase inhibitor (RPX7009) which has activity against serine beta-lactamases, including KPC.

University of Florida,OTHER,NCT03459079,Lanifibranor in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes & Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,"Efficacy, Safety and Mechanism of Action of Lanifibranor (IVA337) in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","The primary aim is to establish the safety, efficacy and mechanism of action of lanifibranor in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Specifically, to determine if lanifibranor decreases intrahepatic triglycerides (IHTG) (primary endpoint), improves hepatic insulin sensitivity, endogenous (hepatic) glucose production, de novo lipogenesis (DNL), HbA1c and lipid profiles. In addition, exploratory analysis with surrogate plasma biomarkers and imaging on liver fibrosis changes on with treatment will be performed.","The study is a two-arm (placebo, lanifibranor 800 mg/day), randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week treatment study. Thirty four (n=34)patients with T2DM will be randomized, allowing for a 10% drop-out rate. The diagnosis of NAFLD on imaging will be done by measuring IHTG using the gold-standard magnetic resonance and spectroscopy (¹H-MRS) technique. Ten non-diabetic subjects without NAFLD will also serve as a control group for the metabolic and imaging procedures. The study will last 34-36 weeks (\~6-8 weeks for run-in, 24 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks post-study follow-up), with an estimated recruitment period of \~9 months. Patients with uncontrolled T2DM and a diagnosis of ""fatty liver"" per history (elevated AST/ALT and/or liver fat on liver ultrasound or ¹H-MRS and/or other appropriate imaging technique - see below). Participants may be treated by diet only, or be on a stable dose of metformin and/or a sulfonylurea and/or a DPP-IV inhibitor for ≥ 2 months prior to enrollment. If the HbA1c is ≤8.0% on any of these diabetes medications, the dose of these medications will be kept stable throughout the study and baseline studies performed as outlined below. If the HbA1c is \> 8.0% but ≤ 9.5%, metformin (minimum dose required: 1,000 mg/day for metformin) and/or a sulfonylurea (minimum dose required: glimepiride 2 mg once daily) will be added, or doses maximized, during the first 2 weeks of the lead-in period. Afterwards, patient's metformin or sulfonylurea dose will be maintained at the new dose stable for 4 weeks before baseline metabolic and study-specific liver imaging.

After patients sign the informed consent and meet eligibility criteria, baseline imaging and metabolic studies will be performed. These will include measurement of IHTG by 1H-MRS, liver fibrosis by VCTE (Fibroscan) and MRE, and additional imaging by T1 MRI mapping. Metabolic testing will be done with the patient being admitted to the CRC (clinical research unit) for an overnight stay. Assessment of insulin sensitivity and DNL will be done with the administration of stable isotopes of glucose (intravenously) and deuterium labeled water (orally) to measure glucose and lipid turnover and substrate oxidation (with indirect calorimetry) during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp.

After all baseline tests are completed, patients will be asked to take a therapeutic dose of 800 mg lanifibranor (QD), or placebo, for 24 weeks. They will be closely followed by study staff every 4 weeks with visits to the CRC and interim phone calls. At 24 weeks, all baseline tests will be repeated and treatment considered completed. There will be a final, off-drug, safety follow-up visit 4 weeks after treatment at week 28. After this the participant will have completed all study procedures.

Note: The investigators recalculated the sample size for the primary endpoint of change in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) measured by 1H-MRS with lanifibranor (800 mg/day) vs. placebo based on the data from the population with diabetes from the Phase IIb NATIVE (NCT03008070: NAsh Trial to Validate IVA337 Efficacy; liver histology results) and comparing to prior studies by Dr. Cusi et al that had simultaneous liver histology and liver fat measured by 1H-MRS (Belfort et al, NEJM 2006; Cusi et al, Annals Int Med 2016). From this analysis, the required sample size per group calls for 15 patients in each arm (lanifibranor vs. placebo) to complete treatment. Conservatively assuming that 10 % of the randomized patients will not complete the trial (dropouts), the total number of patients to be randomized is 33-34 patients.","Inclusion Criteria:

No study to date has investigated the effect of standardized pragmatic exercise protocol added to immediate weight bearing after tibial plateau fractures surgical fixation on patient's functional outcomes, knee ROM, pain, radiographic boney alignment, gait, and return to work.","Tibial plateau fractures can permanently affect patients' quality of life, including significant socio-economic impact due to time off work, compromised knee functional integrity, secondary knee osteoarthritis, knee flexion contractures, job loss due to functional limitations, and limited ability to return to pre-injury level of sports participation. Additionally, patients with tibial plateau fracture are at greater risk of death compared to an age- and the gender-matched reference population.

In orthopedics, weight-bearing refers to how much weight a person bears through an injured body part. During a single-leg stance, a person with no physical limitations will carry 100% of their body weight through each leg. Thus, grades of weight bearing are generally expressed as a percent of the body weight. Weight-bearing grades include (1) Non-weight bearing (NWB), which means the patient is not to put any weight through the affected limb(s); (2) Toe touch weight bearing (TTWB), which is poorly defined in the literature. In clinical practice, it is commonly described as having the ability to touch the toes to the floor without supporting weight from the affected limb. The pressure should be light enough to avoid crushing a potato crisp underfoot. Partial weight bearing (PWB) can range from anything greater than non-weight bearing to anything less than full weight bearing. The status is usually accompanied by a percentage figure to describe the extent of recommended weight bearing further. Most of the definitions in the literature define partial weight bearing as being 30% to 50% of a patient's body weight. Full weight bearing (FWB) means no restriction to weight bearing. In other words, 100% of a person's body weight can be transmitted through the designated limb. This term is somewhat interchangeable with the term 'weight bear as tolerated (WBAT), which allows them to self-limit their weight bearing up to full body weight. Restriction in weight bearing of the operated leg during standing and walking is needed to avoid complications during the postoperative recovery such as mal-union, fracture reduction loss, or hardware failure.

Postoperative rehabilitation for tibial plateau fracture generally involves prolonged non-weight bearing time, while other protocols use partial weight-bearing and bracing before full weight-bearing is recommended at 9 to 12 weeks following fixation. Early weight-bearing and early range of motion (ROM) for cartilage nourishment and preservation after selected lower limb surgical procedures are associated with positive postoperative outcomes, including decreased mortality and morbidity rate, functional improvements, reduced inpatient length of stay, and improved healing process. Early weight-bearing prescription, however, has to be carefully assessed, as it may result in fracture reduction loss, hardware failure, infection, malunion, or nonunion. The effectiveness of immediate partial post-operative weight-bearing in the management of lateral tibial plateau fractures resulted in favorable outcomes after immediate partial weight-bearing of 15 kg in cases of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures fixed with medial and lateral plating, and after immediate partial weight-bearing, up to 25 kg in all types of tibial plateau fractures fixed using a range of approaches.

By using locking plates for tibial plateau fracture surgical management, surgeons can safely allow immediate postoperative weight-bearing. Immediate weight bearing did not produce additional tibial plateau depression greater than 2 mm with Schatzker Type I, II, III, or Type V fractures. This could potentially reduce the rate of postoperative complications due to immobilization, such as deep venous thrombosis and joint stiffness.

Knee ROM limitations and altered gait characteristics are common complications after tibial plateau fractures. Most gait improvements occurred within the first postoperative six months. The total ROM at each lower limb joint showed positive correlations with the patients' capability to conduct normal activities of daily living.

To the authors' knowledge, no randomized control study to date has investigated in patients following tibial plateau fracture surgical fixation the effect of (1) adding immediate weight bearing to tolerance in addition to a specific, tailored exercise program adapted to the type and mechanism of tibial plateau fractures; and (2) adding phones follow-ups to improve compliance and decrease the cost of care.","Inclusion Criteria:

Fraser Health,OTHER,NCT06723379,Genetics of Cytochrome CYP2D6 and Effects of Codeine and Tramadol on Postoperative Pain Management,A Genetic Survey of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Genotypes by Nanopore DNA Sequencing and Clinical Response to Codeine and Tramadol in Postoperative Pain Management,"Codeine is one of the most commonly prescribed opioids in the world. The speed at which our liver metabolizes codeine into morphine depends on an important protein called cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Many people across the world have different CYP2D6 metabolizing speeds. Codeine provides inadequate pain management to those who have slow-metabolizing CYP2D6. In contrast, codeine can be life-threatening to those who have rapidly-metabolizing CYP2D6 because of the abruptly high dose of morphine. By analyzing specific genes, we are able to predict a patient's response to medication, thus drug type and dosing can be tailored according to their genetics. The purpose of this study is to observe if nanopore CYP2D6 DNA genetic sequencing can classify patients according to their CYP2D6 phenotype and thus predict their response to codeine and tramadol. The overall project is to determine the practicality of a genetic survey of CYP2D6 for healthy patients undergoing surgical procedures.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate if genetic variants of CYP2D6 are a predictive factor for postoperative pain management with conventional codeine and tramadol pain therapy. With CYP2D6 DNA analysis, we hope to be able to correlate a patients' genetics and their physiological response to conventional codeine and tramadol dosing.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Is CYP2D6 metabolizer status a predictive factor for the effectiveness of postoperative pain management with conventional pain therapy doses of codeine and tramadol?

HYPOTHESIS: Our hypothesis is that patients with known rapid metabolizing CYP2D6 variants will have higher incidences of opioid side effects with conventional opioid dosing. On the other hand, patients with known poor-metabolizing CYP2D6 variants will have inadequate pain management with conventional opioid dosing.

JUSTIFICATION: Understanding the relationship between CYP2D6 variants and conventional opioid dosing in a clinical setting will facilitate future studies that investigate personalized dosing in order to improve pain management and reduce risk of opioid side effects.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to determine the practicality of undertaking a medium-scale genetic survey of CYP2D6 for healthy patients undergoing surgical procedures. Secondary objectives include: investigate the feasibility of characterizing CYP2D6 genetic variants into one of four metabolizer groups, investigate if there is a distinguishable pattern between CYP2D6 metabolizer status and postoperative pain management quality with conventional pain therapy dosages such as codeine and tramadol, investigate if there is a distinguishable pattern between CYP2D6 metabolizer status and the presence of opioid side effects with conventional pain therapy dosages such as codeine and tramadol, to raise awareness of the clinical relevance of CYP2D6 variants on codeine and tramadol metabolism as well as the complications that arise from conventional, non-personalized pain management.

RESEARCH DESIGN: Prospective observational feasibility study of healthy elective surgical patients. Projected enrolment up to 50 participants. All participants receive standardized anesthetic with weight based dosing of opiates. Data collected will include: 2-3 ml blood sample taken prior to surgery under general anesthesia, DNA sequencing and genotype identification, chart review during post-operative care unit stay (PACU), and a survey administered by phone 24 after discharge from the PACU.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Given the exploratory nature of this feasibility study and small convenience sample size, data will be summarized using descriptive statistics for most outcome variables. If possible, nonparametric statistical tests may be performed to look at associations between genetic variant and outcomes and differences between the groups.","Inclusion Criteria:

Secondary objectives include: investigate the feasibility of characterizing CYP2D6 genetic variants into one of four metabolizer groups, investigate if there is a distinguishable pattern between CYP2D6 metabolizer status and postoperative pain management quality with conventional pain therapy dosages such as codeine and tramadol, investigate if there is a distinguishable pattern between CYP2D6 metabolizer status and the presence of opioid side effects with conventional pain therapy dosages such as codeine and tramadol, to raise awareness of the clinical relevance of CYP2D6 variants on codeine and tramadol metabolism as well as the complications that arise from conventional, non-personalized pain management. RESEARCH DESIGN: Prospective observational feasibility study of healthy elective surgical patients. Projected enrolment up to 50 participants. All participants receive standardized anesthetic with weight based dosing of opiates. Data collected will include: 2-3 ml blood sample taken prior to surgery under general anesthesia, DNA sequencing and genotype identification, chart review during post-operative care unit stay (PACU), and a survey administered by phone 24 after discharge from the PACU. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Given the exploratory nature of this feasibility study and small convenience sample size, data will be summarized using descriptive statistics for most outcome variables. If possible, nonparametric statistical tests may be performed to look at associations between genetic variant and outcomes and differences between the groups. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Age 18-55 year and otherwise healthy (ASA 1 or 2) 2. Undergoing an elective outpatient surgical procedure at Royal Columbian Hospital or Eagle Ridge Hospital with projected moderate post-operative pain 3. Surgical procedure that requires general anaesthetic and post-operative pain management routinely managed with either codeine or tramadol by attending surgeon (i.e., ACL repair) 4. Attending surgeon routinely prescribes either tramadol or codeine for post-operative pain management Exclusion Criteria: 1. Pre-existing chronic pain condition 2. Any psychiatric diagnosis, such as depression or anxiety (Lautenbacher et al., 1994) 3. History of substance abuse/dependence 4. Multiple medical comorbidities (a single well-controlled medical comorbidity will not be a contraindication - i.e., controlled hypothyroidism) 5. Allergy, sensitivity, or other contraindication to either codeine or tramadol 6. Regional anesthetic (inclusive either of a major peripheral nerve block or neuraxial anesthetic) planned by attending anesthesiologist) 7. Unable to provide informed consent"
Egymedicalpedia,INDUSTRY,NCT06025084,The Effect of the Egg Shell Nanoparticles Combined With Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles,The Effect of Egg Shell Nanoparticles Combined With Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles on The Permeability of Dentinal Tubules After Exposure to Wear Challenges and Their Clinical Efficacy in The Treatment of Dentin Hypersensitivity,"Dentin hypersensitivity is one of the most commonly occurring clinical dental conditions which is characterized by short and sharp pain which arises from exposed dentin in response to external stimuli, which typically are thermal, evaporative, tactile, osmotic or chemical.

Hypersensitive dentin is mostly found in buccal tooth areas, in which enamel is missing because of abrasion, attrition, or erosion. The most generally accepted theory regarding the mechanism of dentin hypersensitivity is the hydrodynamic theory. It proposes that a pain-provoking stimulus increases the flow of the dentinal tubular fluid and consequently, stimulates the nerves around the odontoblasts, leading to dentin hypersensitivity.","Dentin desensitizing products, containing agents such as fluoride, strontium salts, oxalate, glutaraldehyde and bioactive glass, are employed to treat dentin hypersensitivity.

Based on the hydrodynamic theory, there are two main strategies for the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity as: (1) occluding the dentinal tubules to reduce the fluid flow, and (2) decreasing the excitability of the intradental nerve.

Although these products and agents were reported to be effective, short durability and poor effectiveness were often exhibited. The therapeutic effects of these desensitizing products were short lived on account of daily tooth brushing or drinking of acidic beverages and the occlusion effects were sometimes incomplete. Owing to these drawbacks, the use of nanomaterials as dentin occluding material has been predicted to be the future of treating DH.

Amorphous Calcium Phosphate (ACP) has the potential to remineralize the structure of tooth. ACP is a soluble calcium phosphate compound that discharges calcium and phosphate ions to change to apatite and remineralize the tooth structure when it comes in contact with saliva. Forming on the enamel and within the dental tubules, ACP provides a reservoir of phosphate and calcium ions in the saliva Casein phospho-peptide (CPP) is a milk-derived protein that joins to the tooth's biofilm and is applied to stabilize ACP. In recent years, remineralization products used CPP as a vehicle to deliver and preserve a super saturation state of ACP near the surface of tooth. A previous study showed that the application of (CPP-ACP) containing agents as GC tooth mousse and MI paste plus can reduce dentin permeability by occluding dentin tubules. It revealed that these materials can be effective for treatment of dentin hypersensitivity.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in developing materials with a bioactive potential that could block the exposed dentinal tubules and subsequently reduce the fluid flow within the tubules. Eggshells (EBs) have been investigated in recent years for their remineralization capabilities. EB has rich bioavailable calcium content in the form of carbonates and oxides. It contains 94% calcium carbonate, 1% calcium phosphate, 1% magnesium carbonate, and 4% organic matter. In addition, eggshell provides a cost-effective, renewable, and sustainable source of material for EnHAp. A previous study revealed that eggshell powder is predicted to be the future of tooth remineralization and highly effective in occluding dentinal tubules and reducing dentin hypersensitivity.

University of Alabama at Birmingham,OTHER,NCT03070184,"Race, Natriuretic Peptides and Physiological Perturbations",Racial Differences in the Natriuretic Peptide Response to Exercise and Beta-blockers,The purpose of the study is to understand the origins of differential response to beta-blockers in African-Americans and may provide insight regarding racial differences in cardiovascular risk.,"The heart is an endocrine organ. The natriuretic peptides are hormones produced in the heart and are secreted in response to increased wall stress in atria and ventricles. The principal circulating NPs are Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). The endocrine actions of NPs are natriuresis and dilatation of peripheral arteries.

The NPs concentrations are elevated in heart failure (HF) and hypertension (HTN) due to volume and pressure overload. Therefore, NPs are used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in heart failure. However, NPs role in healthy individuals is not known.

Previous studies have shown that reduced NP levels are associated with a greater risk of HTN. Moreover, African-Americans have lower resting NP levels than Caucasians. We hypothesize that relative NP deficiency in African American compared to Caucasian has the potential to contribute to increase risk of all-cause mortality, HTN, HF and its sequelae.

Evidence from multiple clinical trials has positioned beta-blockers as a standard heart failure therapy. Beta-blocker therapy leads to increased NP levels and suppression of Renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS) system. Suppression of renin levels by beta-blockers has been shown as a potential mechanism of benefit in HF. However, study shows that beta-blockers are less effective in African-Americans compared to Caucasians in HF treatment. So, the investigators have proposed a pilot study to look for race-based differences in the NP and RAAS response to metoprolol in healthy individuals.

Additionally, exercise has been reported to increase NP levels. ANP increases more than BNP with exercise. But there is no data of NP changes in African-American with exercise. So the investigators have proposed a sub-study of race-based difference in ANP and BNP response to exercise.

University of Florida,OTHER,NCT02780479,Steroids in Children Hospitalized With Asthma,Oral Dexamethasone Versus Oral Prednisone in Children Hospitalized With Asthma: A Randomized Control Study,"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children. A short (3-5 day) course of a short-acting steroid such as Prednisone or Prednisolone has long been the standard of care for asthma exacerbation. Dexamethasone efficacy in asthma exacerbation has been studied in the outpatient setting and was found to be as effective as Prednisone. Dexamethasone has the advantage of shorter course, more compliance, and more tolerable. This has led many emergency departments to provide a 1-2 dose course of Dexamethasone on discharge. Thus, many inpatients have received a first dose of Dexamethasone prior to reaching the inpatient unit, leading to confusion about the best plan for these patients. Many hospitalist pediatricians continue to give a 5-day total course with Prednisone, but some patients have begun to receive a second dose of Dexamethasone 24 hours after the first dose. To our knowledge, no studies have been done to compare the efficacy of these two protocols in pediatric patients requiring hospitalization. The hypothesis is that a second dose of Dexamethasone is as effective as four additional days of Prednisone in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbation. This is an open label, randomized control study comparing these treatments in children age 2-18 hospitalized with asthma exacerbation who have received a first dose of Dexamethasone.","Corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for managing acute asthma exacerbations. Studies have shown that systemic steroids effect decrease relapse and hospital admission. Due to its short half-life, Prednisone is usually given daily or twice daily for 3-5 days. It has been associated with poor compliance due it the prolonged course. Dexamethasone half-life is 36 - 72 hours.

Several studies have shown no difference in outcomes between 3-5 days of prednisone and different forms of dexamethasone, including single intramuscular dose or single oral dose or two oral doses 1 day apart. However, those studies were done in the emergency department (ED). Lack of response to initial asthma treatment in ED results in admission to the hospital, implying more severe exacerbation than those able to be discharged. Some clinician shift to oral prednisone once admitted to the floor for patients who have received Dexamethasone or not. Others have begin to complete the Dexamethasone course with one more dose of Dexamethasone 24 hour after the first dose. Dexamethasone has the advantage of compliance and tolerability, however, no studies investigated its efficacy in hospitalized patients. Such knowledge will improve patient's compliance and outcomes.

* Sample size calculation: Primary outcome of return to normal activities within 3 days of discharge. Based on previous studies, it is estimated that 70% of the control group will achieve this goal. Based on a minimum absolute difference of 15%, and a power of 0.80, the sample size calculated to be 117 in each arm. Assuming 20% lost to follow up, it is intended to recruit 150 in each arm (total 300 subjects).
* Statistical Analysis: Demographics will be analyzed to ensure the experimental and control groups are equivalent at baseline. All proportions will be tested with Chi-square or Fisher exact test and two-sample T-test will be used for continuous variables. α = 0.05 will be used for all hypothesis tests. Interim analysis will be performed monthly and the study will be halted if any safety concerns arise. The Center for Health Equity and Quality Research (CHEQR) will help with statistical analysis

A short (3-5 day) course of a short-acting steroid such as Prednisone or Prednisolone has long been the standard of care for asthma exacerbation. Dexamethasone efficacy in asthma exacerbation has been studied in the outpatient setting and was found to be as effective as Prednisone. Dexamethasone has the advantage of shorter course, more compliance, and more tolerable. This has led many emergency departments to provide a 1-2 dose course of Dexamethasone on discharge. Thus, many inpatients have received a first dose of Dexamethasone prior to reaching the inpatient unit, leading to confusion about the best plan for these patients. Many hospitalist pediatricians continue to give a 5-day total course with Prednisone, but some patients have begun to receive a second dose of Dexamethasone 24 hours after the first dose. To our knowledge, no studies have been done to compare the efficacy of these two protocols in pediatric patients requiring hospitalization. The hypothesis is that a second dose of Dexamethasone is as effective as four additional days of Prednisone in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbation. This is an open label, randomized control study comparing these treatments in children age 2-18 hospitalized with asthma exacerbation who have received a first dose of Dexamethasone. Corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for managing acute asthma exacerbations. Studies have shown that systemic steroids effect decrease relapse and hospital admission. Due to its short half-life, Prednisone is usually given daily or twice daily for 3-5 days. It has been associated with poor compliance due it the prolonged course. Dexamethasone half-life is 36 - 72 hours. Several studies have shown no difference in outcomes between 3-5 days of prednisone and different forms of dexamethasone, including single intramuscular dose or single oral dose or two oral doses 1 day apart. However, those studies were done in the emergency department (ED). Lack of response to initial asthma treatment in ED results in admission to the hospital, implying more severe exacerbation than those able to be discharged. Some clinician shift to oral prednisone once admitted to the floor for patients who have received Dexamethasone or not. Others have begin to complete the Dexamethasone course with one more dose of Dexamethasone 24 hour after the first dose. Dexamethasone has the advantage of compliance and tolerability, however, no studies investigated its efficacy in hospitalized patients. Such knowledge will improve patient's compliance and outcomes. * Sample size calculation: Primary outcome of return to normal activities within 3 days of discharge. Based on previous studies, it is estimated that 70% of the control group will achieve this goal. Based on a minimum absolute difference of 15%, and a power of 0.80, the sample size calculated to be 117 in each arm. Assuming 20% lost to follow up, it is intended to recruit 150 in each arm (total 300 subjects). * Statistical Analysis: Demographics will be analyzed to ensure the experimental and control groups are equivalent at baseline. All proportions will be tested with Chi-square or Fisher exact test and two-sample T-test will be used for continuous variables. α = 0.05 will be used for all hypothesis tests.

Although regularly prescribed by physicians, opioids (including morphine, codeine, and oxycodone) are highly addictive. Opioids block feelings of pain and trigger a release of dopamine. Dependence occurs with repeated use, as the parts of the brain naturally responsible for releasing dopamine rely on the drug for proper function. When avoided, patients quickly experience severe withdrawal symptoms similar to the flu.

In the United States, millions are prescribed opioids for pain relief. Every day, more than 115 people die from overdose. The highest among them are people aged 25 to 54 years. Addiction treatment costs near $78.5 billion and rising, less than 10% of people in need are receiving it.

Within the orthopaedic trauma population at Grady Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia, 20% of patients report a history of substance abuse, 30% have previously used opioid medications for pain, and nearly 25% report taking opioid pain medications up to 1 year after their trauma. Trauma patients are particularly at high risk.

The Christopher Wolf Crusade (CWC) is a 501C3 non-profit providing preventative solutions, education, and advocacy for the American opioid epidemic. CWC's primary focus is to introduce a behavior-specific intervention at the time of inpatient hospitalization for trauma to decrease overall opioid utilization and improve pain control in the post-trauma time period. The goal of this study is to introduce the LCS to the healthcare field to focus on pain management and addiction prevention for patients. The LCS is a behavior-based pain ""coach"" who educates patients on risks of opioid dependence and offers non-traditional non-pharmacologic options for pain control. In addition, the LCS will act as a liaison between the patient and the physician to ensure that traditional pharmacologic-based pain control regimens are optimized.

The pain management protocol was refined through a pilot, single-center study where the LCS provided personalized pain management strategies to patients combating pain. Participants in the single-arm pilot portion of the study were enrolled beginning in February 2020 and data collection for these 121 participants was completed April 15, 2021.

Obesity and MetS are commonly associated with an inflammatory status. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of echocardiographically measured epicardial fat thickness (EFT) and inflammation, on the basis of c-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with MetS and its components in people with obesity.

A total of 104 patients with body mass index (BMI)≥30 kg/m² were enrolled to the study. In all participants, EFT was measured with transthoracic echocardiography at end-systole. The patients were then classified into two groups according to whether they had MetS or not. EFT, clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between the two groups","Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a kind of VAT, between the surface of the myocardium and the epicardium. It can easily be measured by standard two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. EAT serves as an endocrin organ that secretes hormones, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Previous data suggests that EAT can play an active role in the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Previous studies have investigated the relationship between EAT/inflammatory markers and MetS/MetS components. However, there was lack of enough evidence regarding this relationship in people with obesity with or without MetS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of echocardiographically measured EAT and inflammation, on the basis of c-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), as simple and reliable indicators of inflammation, with MetS and its components in people with obesity who have similar body mass index (BMI) values. In this cross-sectional study, 104 consecutive patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 who presented to the 'Obesity Solution Center 'of Antalya Research and Training Hospital were included . Patients with manifest heart disease such as, coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, cardiac valve disease or arrythmia, renal failure, hepatic failure, infection, chronic systemic inflammatory disease, pulmonary disease , malignancy and inadequate transthoracic echocardiographic images were excluded. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from each subject.

Clinical information and current cardiovascular medication use were provided from each patient. Height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference (HC) were measured when fasting and standing up with standard measuring tools. Patients were defined as having hypertension (HT) if their systolic blood pressure was \>140 mmHg, their diastolic blood pressure was \>90 mmHg, or they were using an antihypertensive medication. Blood samples were obtained after overnight fasting. Fasting blood glucose, urea, creatinine, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, CRP, fasting and postprandial insulin, C-peptid levels, vitamin D, ferritin and complete blood counts were measured using standard methods. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the method described by Matthews et al. NLR was defined as the log e neutrophil count/log e lymphocyte count within the peripheral blood. Patients were defined as having diabetes mellitus (DM) if they had a history of taking an oral antidiabetic or insulin medication, or if their fasting plasma glucose was ≥ 126 mg/dl. The patients were classified into two groups according to whether they had MetS or not. MetS was diagnosed according to the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III).

Comparisons to results from a similar project in methadone-exposed pregnancies will be made. This proposal seeks to advance the way the investigators inform the treatment of the opioid dependent woman during pregnancy and her infant after birth.","There is an increase in the prevalence of illicit opiate use among women of childbearing age in many countries today. Methadone is the treatment of choice for opioid dependency during pregnancy in the US because it markedly diminishes withdrawal symptoms and craving and blocks opioid effects, however, in utero exposure results in significant depression of fetal neurobehaviors such as fetal heart rate and heart rate variability and fetal motor activity, and significant neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the majority of exposed infants. Since its approval in 2002, the prescription of buprenorphine for opioid dependence has increased dramatically but, as with methadone, this mediation is not approved for use during pregnancy. Currently, women treated with buprenorphine prior to pregnancy are transitioned to methadone treatment due to a lack of information regarding the effects of buprenorphine on the developing fetus and infant. Pilot work by this research team suggests that buprenorphine- as compared to methadone-exposed fetuses display more optimal neurobehavioral functioning in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Although these results are encouraging, there is a critical need to explore fully the effects of this medication on the fetus and infant to adequately advise care providers and patients regarding its use. This is particularly true given the imminent publication of a pivotal study comparing buprenorphine to methadone treatment during pregnancy which has suggested the optimality of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence during pregnancy, and is likely to result in increasing numbers of women being treated with off-label buprenorphine during pregnancy. This proposal seeks to explore the effect of buprenorphine on maternal physiology and fetal neurobehavioral functioning longitudinally as a measure of the development of the fetal nervous system. Additionally, the neurobehavioral profile and NAS of the buprenorphine-exposed infant up to one month will be delineated in an effort to provide information necessary to provide optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment of NAS. Furthermore, this group has previously explored similar parameters in methadone-exposed fetuses and infants, and results of this study can be compared to those historical data. These parameters will advance our understanding of the way the investigators view and implement the future pharmacologic treatment of the opiate dependent woman during pregnancy and her infant after birth, and inform clinicians, health insurance companies and regulatory agencies in the provision of optimal care to the opioid dependent pregnant woman and her offspring before and after birth.","Inclusion Criteria:

In France, they are the second leading cause of death after cancer, with over 140,000 deaths each year.

The number of people with cardiovascular disease increases with the aging of the population, and strong social and territorial inequalities persist. Innovative cardiovascular risk factors screening campaign can have significant public interest, especially to raise awareness and diagnose a particular population which is not monitored by a physician on a regular basis.

The VACCIPREV project emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic. The founding idea was to use the time people spent in vaccination centers to raise awareness and to diagnose people, for some, never go to a health facility. Indeed, a portion of the population free of all medical conditions, of all ages, including young people without known comorbidities, then crossed the threshold of our institutions to get vaccinated.

VACCIPREV is part of a global territorial prevention will to propose to this population flow an innovative medical technology optimizing all stages of vaccination.

In association with a French company named ""H4D"", developing a connected teleconsultation booth (CONSULT STATION®), an independent health check was thus structured, in addition with two questionnaires given during the waiting phase before vaccination: one concerning tobacco dependance and the other assessing the sleep quality. This health check focuses on the early detection of cardiovascular risk factors. It is indeed a key issue for medical management and VACCIPREV allows to respond to this issue in an innovative and playful way.

In case of potentially pathological results, and with the person's consent, contact informations (telephone/email) were collected to remotely assess the impact of this screening campaign.

VACCIPREV programme included an idependant medical check-up with the connected booth H4D, questionnaires of tabacco dependance and assessment of sleep quality and a remote assessment of their impact on the medical management of people with pathological constants. A telephone interview was carried out after a period of at least 3 months following the passage in the cabin to complete the medical questionnaire in order to evaluate changes in patients medical management.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a blood cancer. Recombinant human interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a manmade protein. Obinutuzumab is a protein made to deactivate cancer cells. Researchers want to see if treating people with CLL with both proteins improves their outcomes.

Objectives:

To find the safe dose of IL-15 with Obinutuzumab. To identify its effects, including on the immune system and cancer.

Eligibility:

Adults at least 18 years old who have certain CLL that standard therapy has failed

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Evaluation of ability to do daily activities
* Blood, heart, and urine tests

Participants may also be screened with:

* A small amount of bone marrow removed by needle in the hipbone
* Scans of the body and/or brain

The study will be done in 28-day cycles for up to 6 cycles.

Participants will get the study drugs through a catheter and pump.

Cycle 1: Participants will be seen in the clinic during week 1. They will get:

* IL-15 as a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours on days 1-5 and 3 dose levels will be evaluated: dose level 1; 0.5 mcg/kg/day; dose level 2: 1 mcg/kg/day and dose level 3: 2 mcg/kg/day.
* Obinutuzumab as a 4-hour infusion in escalating doses during the course of the first cycle 100 mg on day 4, 900 mg on day 5, 1000 mg on day 11 and day 18.

Cycles 2 through 6: Participants will come to the clinic days 1-5 and get IL-15 as in cycle 1 and Obinutuzumab 1000 mg on day 4 of each treatment cycle.

During the study, participants:

* Will repeat screening tests
* Will get standard medicines for side effects
* May give blood, saliva, and tumor samples for research

After treatment, participants will have follow-up visits every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for up to 5 years. After that, participants may be called or emailed.","Background:

* Of the several drugs and drug combinations approved for treatment of relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the reported complete response rates are no greater than 30%.
* Obinutuzumab is a glycoengineered, humanized type 2 anti-cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) monoclonal antibody thought to engage the immune system by directly activating antibody-dependent, cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); it is approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with chlorambucil.
* The key mediators of ADCC are polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells.
* Recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) is a stimulatory cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes, and long-term cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) + memory T-cells. In a Phase I trial, administration of rhIL-15 as a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion (civ) was associated with up to 45-fold increase in the number of NK cells at well tolerated dose levels.
* Preclinical murine lymphoid malignancy models have shown increased efficacy of monoclonal antibodies when administered together with recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15); BL/6 mice inoculated with EL4 murine T-cell lymphoma expressing human cluster of differentiation 20 (EL4-CD20) cells (a syngeneic lymphoma line); including significant prolongation of survival with the IL-15/Rituximab combination compared to either drug given as single agent (90% v. 30% alive at 75 days).

Objectives:

- To determine the safety, toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of civ rhIL-15 administration in combination with intravenous (IV) Obinutuzumab treatment

* Adequate organ function parameters as defined within the protocol
* Active disease requiring treatment, as defined within the protocol

Design:

* This is a single institution non-randomized Phase I dose escalation study evaluating increasing doses of civ rhIL-15 in combination with Obinutuzumab using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design.
* On days 1-5 of each 4-week cycle, rhIL-15 will be administered by civ at dose levels 0.5, 1, and 2 mcg/kg/day.
* During the first cycle, Obinutuzumab will be administered at a dose of 100 mg by IV on day 4, 900 mg on day 5, 1,000 mg on day 11, and 1,000 mg on day 18: then 1,000 mg on day 4 of each subsequent cycle.

Recombinant human interleukin 15 (IL-15) is a manmade protein. Obinutuzumab is a protein made to deactivate cancer cells. Researchers want to see if treating people with CLL with both proteins improves their outcomes. Objectives: To find the safe dose of IL-15 with Obinutuzumab. To identify its effects, including on the immune system and cancer. Eligibility: Adults at least 18 years old who have certain CLL that standard therapy has failed Design: Participants will be screened with: * Medical history * Physical exam * Evaluation of ability to do daily activities * Blood, heart, and urine tests Participants may also be screened with: * A small amount of bone marrow removed by needle in the hipbone * Scans of the body and/or brain The study will be done in 28-day cycles for up to 6 cycles. Participants will get the study drugs through a catheter and pump. Cycle 1: Participants will be seen in the clinic during week 1. They will get: * IL-15 as a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours on days 1-5 and 3 dose levels will be evaluated: dose level 1; 0.5 mcg/kg/day; dose level 2: 1 mcg/kg/day and dose level 3: 2 mcg/kg/day. * Obinutuzumab as a 4-hour infusion in escalating doses during the course of the first cycle 100 mg on day 4, 900 mg on day 5, 1000 mg on day 11 and day 18. Cycles 2 through 6: Participants will come to the clinic days 1-5 and get IL-15 as in cycle 1 and Obinutuzumab 1000 mg on day 4 of each treatment cycle. During the study, participants: * Will repeat screening tests * Will get standard medicines for side effects * May give blood, saliva, and tumor samples for research After treatment, participants will have follow-up visits every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for up to 5 years. After that, participants may be called or emailed. Background: * Of the several drugs and drug combinations approved for treatment of relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the reported complete response rates are no greater than 30%. * Obinutuzumab is a glycoengineered, humanized type 2 anti-cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) monoclonal antibody thought to engage the immune system by directly activating antibody-dependent, cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); it is approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with chlorambucil. * The key mediators of ADCC are polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. * Recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) is a stimulatory cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes, and long-term cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) + memory T-cells. In a Phase I trial, administration of rhIL-15 as a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion (civ) was associated with up to 45-fold increase in the number of NK cells at well tolerated dose levels. * Preclinical murine lymphoid malignancy models have shown increased efficacy of monoclonal antibodies when administered together with recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15); BL/6 mice inoculated with EL4 murine T-cell lymphoma expressing human cluster of differentiation 20 (EL4-CD20) cells (a syngeneic lymphoma line); including significant prolongation of survival with the IL-15/Rituximab combination compared to either drug given as single agent (90% v. 30% alive at 75 days).

Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research,OTHER,NCT00752479,Mesenchymal Stem Cells Under Basiliximab/Low Dose RATG to Induce Renal Transplant Tolerance,Mesenchymal Stem Cells Under Basiliximab/Low Dose RATG to Induce Renal Transplant Tolerance,"This a pilot, explorative study to define the safety and biological/mechanistic effect of the systemic intravenous infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs in living-related kidney transplant recipients (one or two HLA haplotype mismatches) under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive drugs with the ultimate objective to test the feasibility of safely achieving graft tolerance in a subsequent efficacy pilot study.

Specific objectives To compare changes in the immunophenotype and ex-vivo T-cell functional tests from samples of peripheral blood and measurement in the urine of messenger RNA for FoxP3,in kidney transplant recipients given or not syngeneic (from the recipient) MSC infusion under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

This will assess at different time up to 12 months post transplant. In addition the safety profile of MSC infusion will be investigated. We have planned to start with the safety and biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related kidney transplant recipients. Three patients will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC infusion (2x106 MSCs per kilogram body weight) at the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls), both under the cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the study.

Should this biological/mechanistic ex vivo studies document that MSC infusion allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, a pilot efficacy study to achieve operational tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow.

In this additional pilot explorative efficacy study all consecutive patients will be included and followed until the first episode of rejection (if any) will occur or 29 consecutive patients have successfully withdrawn the immunosuppressive therapy. This has been estimated according to the Simon's two-stage minimax design.","INTRODUCTION In organ transplantation the immunosuppressive drugs have dramatically improved the life of transplant recipients over the past 30 years, but two notable problems remain:drug-associated toxicities, and failure of these drugs to prevent chronic graft dysfunction and extend long-term graft survival. Given these circumstances, the scientific discussion is dominated by designing effective ways to induce transplantation tolerance. 'Transplantation tolerance' describes a state in which a donor is 'accepted' without chronic immunosuppressive therapy, while the remainder of the immune system is left intact. Thus, lack of a pathogenic response to the alloantigen is specific, and the recipient is capable of responding to potentially pathogenic microorganisms and malignancies. There is abundant evidence for active immunoregulatory mechanisms, which may operate to maintain transplant tolerance.

The problems of immunosuppressive drug toxicity could be alleviated by induction of immune tolerance.Over the last 25 years, several strategies have been used successfully to induce transplantation tolerance. Each of these has been validated in at least one rodent model, with varying degrees of success upon extension to large animals, including nonhuman primates. Very small minorities of patients, who discontinue their immunosuppression, provide rare examples of clinical transplantation tolerance. To this purpose, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusion could represent a novel tolerogenic cell therapy in kidney transplantation.

Human bone marrow stem cells, more recently referred to as MSCs, are multipotential cells that reside within the bone marrow and can differentiate into various components of the marrow microenvironment, in addition to supporting growth of hematopoietic progenitors.There is also evidence that MSCs escape the immune system, and therefore could be infused into an allogeneic host without being rejected and without requirement of conditioning regimens. Moreover, they exert an immunoregulatory activity, although the exact mechanism of action is unknown. On this line, evidence is available that MSC inhibit naïve T cells and lock dendritic cells (DC) into a semi-mature state, thereby favoring peripheral tolerance. It should be also pointed out that experimental in vitro evidence has shown that mouse MSCs inhibit the response of memory antigen-specific T cells to their cognate peptide. We expect that, in kidney transplant recipients, MSC infusion would allow inhibition of alloantigen-specific memory T cell response contributing to long-term graft survival. Moreover in vitro studies have documented that the CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell population increased significantly in MLR when human MSCs were present compared to controls without MSCs. These findings suggest that MSC may modulate T cell response even through a regulatory mechanism. Furthermore an immunosuppressive effect of MSCs in vivo has been shown in a baboon model, in which infusion of ex-vivo expanded matched donor or third-party MSCs delayed the time to rejection of histoincompatible skin graft. The immunomodulatory function of MSCs has been also documented in preliminary in vivo studies in humans, where cell infusion did exert preventive effects on the development of acute and chronic GVHD. Thus, although no data so far are available in human kidney transplantation, we expect that peri-transplant intravenous infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs under peripheral T-cell depletion/blockade with basiliximab and low dose RATG (as induction therapy) and the cover of low dose maintenance immunosuppressive drugs would allow to safety achieving graft tolerance in living-related kidney transplant recipients. This could be through inhibition of both naïve and memory T cells, and promotion of development and activation of regulatory T cells, eventually leading to indefinite graft survival.

Up to now there is no clinical study that MSC infusion has an immunomodulatory effect in patients undergoing kidney transplant. Nevertheless, there are clinical data on the effectiveness and safety of MSC infusion in other diseases/conditions.

The general aim of the present study is to test a cell therapy with syngeneic ex vivo expanded MSC as a strategy to induce tolerance in living-related kidney transplant recipients. MSC will be prepared accordingly to established protocols, starting from bone marrow explants of living-related recipients obtained 3-4 months before kidney transplant. From these samples, MSC will be expanded in vitro and used for the present study in patients undergoing kidney transplantation.

AIMS AND STUDY DESIGN This a pilot, explorative study to define the safety and biological/mechanistic effect of the systemic intravenous infusion of syngeneic ex-vivo expanded MSCs in living-related kidney transplant recipients (one or two HLA haplotype mismatches) under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive drugs with the ultimate objective to test the feasibility of safely achieving graft tolerance in a subsequent efficacy pilot study. Indeed, to complement the research with a clinical portion that document operational tolerance, a pilot efficacy study of safely achieving kidney graft tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow pending on the fact that the results of biological/mechanistic tests will document that MSC infusion allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance.

Specific objectives To compare changes in the immunophenotype and ex-vivo T-cell functional tests from samples of peripheral blood and measurement in the urine of messenger RNA for FoxP3,in kidney transplant recipients given or not syngeneic (from the recipient) MSC infusion under basiliximab/low-dose RATG induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppressive treatment with low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) plus low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

In particular, at different time up to 12 months post transplant, the plan is the following:

Immunophenotyping

1. To assess the effect of the treatment on absolute and percent count of circulating CD4+, CD8+ T cells (and the CD4/CD8 ratio), B cells and NK cells.
2. To examine whether changes in circulating naïve and memory T cell count may occur (CD45RA/CD45RO).
3. To characterize the emergence in the circulation of T cell subpopulations with immunoregulatory phenotype (CD4+CD25highFOXP3+; CD8+CD28-, CD3-CD56bright).

Lymphocyte functional assays

1. To detect whether donor-specific hyporesponsiveness develops post-operatively by monitoring T cell activation in response to alloantigen stimulation by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), by ELISPOT assay for IFN-gamma and by cell-mediated lympholysis (CML).
2. To determine whether T cell deletion/anergy develops by repeating T cell stimulation in MLR and in IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay in the presence of high doses of IL-2.
3. To monitor the regulatory properties of T cells circulating in the peripheral blood by in vitro proliferative assay, in particular of CD4+CD25high, CD8+CD28- T cells, and CD56bright NK cells.

Urinary FOXP3 messenger RNA

a)To evaluate whether measurement in urinary cells of mRNA level for FoxP3, a functional factor for regulatory T lymphocytes, may provide insight into the immunologic events within the renal allograft.

In addition the safety profile of MSC infusion will be investigated.

Should this biological/mechanistic ex vivo studies document that MSC infusion allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, a pilot efficacy study to achieve operational tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow. The criteria to document the development of a pro-tolerogenic microenvironment (at 12 months post-kidney transplant) are the followings:

* Percentage of inhibition of memory T cell response (by IFN-gamma ELISPOT) and/or naïve T cell response (by MLR) versus donor antigens higher than 15-20% in patients receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to patients receiving the immunosuppressive therapy alone, in the context of normal immune responses versus third party antigens, mitogens (PHA) and recall antigens (mumps, pertussis).

and

* Induction of donor-reactive T cell anergy in a percentage higher than 15-20% in patients receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to those given the immunosuppressive therapy alone (evaluated by addition of high dose IL-2 in ELISPOT assay) or
* Appearance in the peripheral blood of regulatory T cells in a percentage higher than 80% in patients receiving peri-transplant MSC infusion as compared to patients receiving the immunosuppressive therapy alone and reversal of the inhibition of donor-specific immune response (evaluated by depletion of specific regulatory cells in ELISPOT and/or MLR assays) in a percentage higher than 50% in MSC-treated as compared with non MSC-treated patients.

We have planned to start with the safety and biological/mechanistic study in 6 living-related kidney transplant recipients. Three patients will receive ex-vivo expanded syngeneic MSC infusion at the time of kidney transplant, and 3 additional patients no cells (controls), both under the cover of induction therapy with basiliximab and low-dose RATG, and maintenance immunosuppression with low-dose CsA and MMF. Randomization to MSC or no cell infusion will be performed at the time the recipient will sign the informed consent to participate to the study. This will be when the patients fulfill all the criteria to enter the waiting list for kidney transplant from living donor.

The first patient will receive a single i.v infusion of syngeneic MSC (2x106 MSCs per kilogram body weight). If the procedure is safe and no major adverse events related to the i.v cell infusion will occur within the first month (early peri-infusion side effects, severe infections possibly due to over-immunosuppression), the second patients will be enrolled. Should the procedure be safe also in this case, the third kidney transplant patient will be enrolled and undergo syngeneic MSC infusion.

To complement this research with a clinical portion that document operational tolerance, a pilot efficacy study of safely achieving kidney graft tolerance after complete withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy will follow pending on the fact that the results of biological/mechanistic tests (at 12 months post-transplant) will document that MSC infusion allows the development of an immune microenvironment permissive to graft tolerance, as higher inhibition of donor specific memory T cells and/or higher generation of alloantigen-specific regulatory T cells than the drug immunosuppressive treatment alone.

In this additional pilot explorative efficacy study all consecutive patients will be included and followed until the first episode of rejection (if any) will occur or 29 consecutive patients have successfully withdrawn the immunosuppressive therapy. This has been estimated according to the Simon's two-stage minimax design.","Inclusion Criteria:

INTRODUCTION In organ transplantation the immunosuppressive drugs have dramatically improved the life of transplant recipients over the past 30 years, but two notable problems remain:drug-associated toxicities, and failure of these drugs to prevent chronic graft dysfunction and extend long-term graft survival.

In this way, individuals can gain experience and reach self-awareness as a result of theory and skill-based training and feel more motivated to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors. Multicomponent interventions offer a more comprehensive approach by combining a variety of methods, such as mindfulness, exercise, and dietary changes, as well as educational programs.

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,OTHER,NCT03834779,HIV+ Substance Users Released From Jail,A Community-Clinic Collaboration to Improve Outcomes in HIV+ Substance Users Released From Jail,"The long-term goal of this project is to improve HIV and substance use outcomes and reduce recidivism for HIV+ substance users released from jail. The overall objective of the proposed R34 project is to develop and pilot test a multi-sector community-clinic collaborative intervention that can subsequently be implemented on a larger scale (as part of a future R01) to achieve this goal. Our central hypothesis is that HIV+ substance users released from jail can successfully overcome obstacles to re-entry and continuity of HIV care with individualized, culturally competent assistance in navigating both social and medical services.

Aim 1: Develop and refine a collaborative CHW and re-entry program intervention that targets HIV outcomes, substance use and recidivism in HIV+ jail releasees.

Aim 2: Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the collaborative intervention (n=40) compared to treatment as usual (n=40) in HIV+ substance users released from jail.","Aim 1 Introduction: This first aim will be critical to successful implementation of the CHW-DOORS intervention. Employing a formerly incarcerated CHW to assist individuals leaving prison in order to connect to healthcare has been successfully implemented in different settings, but it has not been applied specifically to HIV patients or those leaving jail (v. prison), nor has it been integrated into a community based organization. The objective of this aim is to adapt the evidence-based CHW intervention to the HIV population and to the jail setting and to integrate the CHW into existing processes at DOORS and the outpatient HIV clinic system.

Research Design. Aim 1.1: The first step of Aim 1 will be to train the CHW using the transitions clinic approach, add modules on HIV and substance use and familiarize the CHW with DOORS processes and HIV clinic workflow.

Aim 1.2: The second step will be to complete qualitative interviews with stakeholders in three different settings- the jail, the HIV clinic and DOORS. All interviews will be semi-structured, one-on-one interviews, with an estimated 4-7 interviews in each setting.

The structured component of the interview guide will prompt interviewee input on study design (e.g. recruitment, intervention, follow-up visits), content of the intervention (e.g. high demand services) and an open-ended component eliciting possible barriers to study implementation.

Aim 1.3: The final step in Aim 1 will be to complete pilot testing with 5 subjects, which will focus on refining recruitment/enrollment protocols, streamlining study assessments and evaluating the intervention.

Recruitment: In order to protect patient confidentiality, potential subjects will be referred by medical staff who provide clinical care to HIV+ inmates. When an inmate enters the Dallas County Jail, he/she is evaluated by a medical provider within 24 hours (medical assessment program, MAP). At this visit, the inmate can disclose any medical conditions that they have including HIV, in which case he/she will be referred to the jail HIV clinic (scheduled within 1-7 days of jail entry). In addition, HIV testing is offered in an opt-out manner when inmates have blood drawn for any reason (approximately 10% of jail population) and by inmate request, and those with positive test results are referred to jail HIV clinic. Candidates coming through the MAP or HIV clinics who agree to be approached will be contacted by a research assistant (RA). The RA will explain the study to interested individuals, will obtain additional contact information (additional phone numbers, address or location in community where patient could be found) and permission to contact the individual after release. Clinic staff will also routinely request this information from interested individuals in case they are released prior to RA visit in jail. Once released, the research team will contact the individual releasee to schedule an enrollment visit. At this visit, which will occur as soon as possible after jail release (maximum within 30 days of release), the research team will obtain informed consent and enroll the participant into the study. The enrollment may occur at the UT Southwestern HIV research unit (located above the main HIV clinic) or in the community as per participant preference.

Enrollment: In order to be enrolled, individuals must (a) be ≥18 years old, (b) have a confirmed diagnosis of HIV, (c) have evidence of uncontrolled HIV (viral load \>200 copies/mL within 90 days of enrollment, self-reported non-adherence to HIV medications or no community clinic visit in the 6 months preceding incarceration), (d) report or have medical records documenting any opioid (illicit or prescription misuse), stimulant (cocaine, ecstasy, or amphetamines), or heavy alcohol use (as determined by the 3-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) within the past 12 months, and (e) provide at least 2 forms of contact information. They will also be asked to provide a release of information for their medical records at the jail and community clinics/ hospitals. No randomization will occur in Aim 1 as all 5 participants in the pilot testing phase will be assigned to the intervention. Baseline assessments will occur after informed consent is obtained and enrollment is complete. These assessments will focus on variables in the conceptual model, with collection of demographics (age, race/ethnicity, gender, HIV risk factor) and social variables (marital status, housing, education, employment/income, insurance, benefits, social support). Subjects will also be asked about HIV care (engagement in care, antiretroviral therapy, adherence to medications (using visual analog scale), barriers to care), mental illness, and substance use (using ASSIST questionnaire).

Intervention: The first meeting with the CHW will occur at the time of enrollment if possible, depending on availability of the participant and CHW, otherwise it may occur anytime within 14 days of enrollment. After release from jail, the CHW will help the participant navigate to DOORS, where they will meet with a ""broker"", someone who helps the client/participant arrange and negotiate referrals to services within the extensive partner/provider network. The first broker meeting will typically occur within 2-4 weeks after release, as this is a critical window for re-engagement in care, underscored by the fact that this is also a high-risk period for increased unprotected sex and return to substance use. Per DOORS' standard practice, the broker will complete a comprehensive needs assessment with the participant. Based on these assessments, together with the participant, the broker will develop a personalized re-entry plan with a detailed list of referrals and calendar of scheduled visits with relevant agencies within the DOORS network.

Follow-up visits and assessments: Research visits will be scheduled at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. A 4-week window before and 8-week window after the target follow-up dates will be permitted for study assessments. Assessments will be completed at each follow-up visit, including substance use, adherence, healthcare utilization and recidivism, with blood draw for HIV viral load collected at the 6-month visit. In order to maximize efficient utilization of resources, for baseline and other follow-up visits, HIV viral load will be abstracted from medical records. In order to have sufficient time to enroll and complete 12 month study visits for the 80 participants in Aim 2, the 5 pilot participants from Aim 1.3 need to reach at least the 3 month time point but not 6 or 12-month visits before beginning study enrollment for Aim 2. Pilot participants will complete through 12-month visits as this will provide insight as to how best to conduct these later follow-up visits. All participants will receive financial reimbursement for study visits ($25 for each visit), unless they are incarcerated at the time of the visit. Jail inmates are not permitted to receive any financial incentives during incarceration.

AIM 2: Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the collaborative intervention (n=40) compared to treatment as usual (n=40) in HIV+ substance users released from jail.

Introduction. In this aim, we will test the CHW-DOORS intervention that was refined in Aim 1 in a randomized fashion. The goal of this aim is to establish feasibility of a randomized controlled trial in this setting, to determine preliminary efficacy of the intervention and to inform sample size calculations for a fully powered trial. In addition, this aim will provide data regarding key factors involved in HIV+ substance users accessing substance use treatment and HIV care after jail release. Our working hypothesis is that from the stakeholder input and pilot testing completed in Aim 1, we will be able to successfully conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial and gain valuable insight into key predisposing and enabling factors influencing healthcare needs and utilization in this population, and how these may impact HIV viral load, substance use and recidivism.

Research Design. Potential participants will be referred to the research study by Dallas County jail medical providers as described in Aim 1.3. Candidates who agree to be approached will be contacted by a RA who will recruit, and review eligibility criteria (see Aim 1.3). After release, potential participants will be contacted in order to complete informed consent, study enrollment and randomization (to be completed within 30 days of release from jail). All participants will provide 2 specific forms of locator information (telephone number for themselves, friend/family member, address, email, specific location where they may be located to aid in retention efforts). Participants will complete baseline assessments and will then be randomized to the intervention CHW-DOORS versus treatment as usual (TAU). Randomization will occur by random assignment using a computer program, without block randomization given the small sample size. TAU participants will receive standard of care, which involves passive referral by jail medical staff to the outpatient HIV clinic.

Intervention. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will meet with the CHW and a staff member from DOORS as outlined in Aim 1.3. Any modifications to this protocol after pilot testing in Aim 1.3 will be implemented in Aim 2. The general premise will be the same, where the DOORS broker will complete a needs assessment, generate an individualized re-entry plan and make referrals to providers in the extensive DOORS network. The CHW will assist the participant in navigating these referrals, specifically with regards to HIV care, substance use treatment and mental healthcare. The measurement of the intervention will be as noted in Aim 1.3, with the DOORS broker following routine agency processes for referrals and measurement using the PIECES technology program and the CHW will record specifics (where, when, duration) of each visit and what was addressed during these intervention visits.

Study Assessments. All participants will complete baseline assessments prior to randomization and will have follow-up visits at 3, 6 and 12 months as noted in Aim 1.3. A blood draw will be performed for 6-month HIV viral load. Follow-up visits will assess HIV viral load (abstracted from medical record for all visits other than 6 month), substance use (using ASSIST), healthcare utilization including attendance of HIV clinic visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and reincarceration. If individuals are reincarcerated at the Dallas County Jail at the time of the follow-up visits, an attempt will be made to complete study visits at the jail.","Inclusion Criteria:

The overall objective of the proposed R34 project is to develop and pilot test a multi-sector community-clinic collaborative intervention that can subsequently be implemented on a larger scale (as part of a future R01) to achieve this goal. Our central hypothesis is that HIV+ substance users released from jail can successfully overcome obstacles to re-entry and continuity of HIV care with individualized, culturally competent assistance in navigating both social and medical services. Aim 1: Develop and refine a collaborative CHW and re-entry program intervention that targets HIV outcomes, substance use and recidivism in HIV+ jail releasees. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the collaborative intervention (n=40) compared to treatment as usual (n=40) in HIV+ substance users released from jail. Aim 1 Introduction: This first aim will be critical to successful implementation of the CHW-DOORS intervention. Employing a formerly incarcerated CHW to assist individuals leaving prison in order to connect to healthcare has been successfully implemented in different settings, but it has not been applied specifically to HIV patients or those leaving jail (v. prison), nor has it been integrated into a community based organization. The objective of this aim is to adapt the evidence-based CHW intervention to the HIV population and to the jail setting and to integrate the CHW into existing processes at DOORS and the outpatient HIV clinic system. Research Design. Aim 1.1: The first step of Aim 1 will be to train the CHW using the transitions clinic approach, add modules on HIV and substance use and familiarize the CHW with DOORS processes and HIV clinic workflow. Aim 1.2: The second step will be to complete qualitative interviews with stakeholders in three different settings- the jail, the HIV clinic and DOORS. All interviews will be semi-structured, one-on-one interviews, with an estimated 4-7 interviews in each setting. The structured component of the interview guide will prompt interviewee input on study design (e.g. recruitment, intervention, follow-up visits), content of the intervention (e.g. high demand services) and an open-ended component eliciting possible barriers to study implementation. Aim 1.3: The final step in Aim 1 will be to complete pilot testing with 5 subjects, which will focus on refining recruitment/enrollment protocols, streamlining study assessments and evaluating the intervention. Recruitment: In order to protect patient confidentiality, potential subjects will be referred by medical staff who provide clinical care to HIV+ inmates. When an inmate enters the Dallas County Jail, he/she is evaluated by a medical provider within 24 hours (medical assessment program, MAP). At this visit, the inmate can disclose any medical conditions that they have including HIV, in which case he/she will be referred to the jail HIV clinic (scheduled within 1-7 days of jail entry). In addition, HIV testing is offered in an opt-out manner when inmates have blood drawn for any reason (approximately 10% of jail population) and by inmate request, and those with positive test results are referred to jail HIV clinic. Candidates coming through the MAP or HIV clinics who agree to be approached will be contacted by a research assistant (RA). The RA will explain the study to interested individuals, will obtain additional contact information (additional phone numbers, address or location in community where patient could be found) and permission to contact the individual after release. Clinic staff will also routinely request this information from interested individuals in case they are released prior to RA visit in jail. Once released, the research team will contact the individual releasee to schedule an enrollment visit. At this visit, which will occur as soon as possible after jail release (maximum within 30 days of release), the research team will obtain informed consent and enroll the participant into the study. The enrollment may occur at the UT Southwestern HIV research unit (located above the main HIV clinic) or in the community as per participant preference. Enrollment: In order to be enrolled, individuals must (a) be ≥18 years old, (b) have a confirmed diagnosis of HIV, (c) have evidence of uncontrolled HIV (viral load \>200 copies/mL within 90 days of enrollment, self-reported non-adherence to HIV medications or no community clinic visit in the 6 months preceding incarceration), (d) report or have medical records documenting any opioid (illicit or prescription misuse), stimulant (cocaine, ecstasy, or amphetamines), or heavy alcohol use (as determined by the 3-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) within the past 12 months, and (e) provide at least 2 forms of contact information. They will also be asked to provide a release of information for their medical records at the jail and community clinics/ hospitals. No randomization will occur in Aim 1 as all 5 participants in the pilot testing phase will be assigned to the intervention. Baseline assessments will occur after informed consent is obtained and enrollment is complete. These assessments will focus on variables in the conceptual model, with collection of demographics (age, race/ethnicity, gender, HIV risk factor) and social variables (marital status, housing, education, employment/income, insurance, benefits, social support). Subjects will also be asked about HIV care (engagement in care, antiretroviral therapy, adherence to medications (using visual analog scale), barriers to care), mental illness, and substance use (using ASSIST questionnaire). Intervention: The first meeting with the CHW will occur at the time of enrollment if possible, depending on availability of the participant and CHW, otherwise it may occur anytime within 14 days of enrollment. After release from jail, the CHW will help the participant navigate to DOORS, where they will meet with a ""broker"", someone who helps the client/participant arrange and negotiate referrals to services within the extensive partner/provider network. The first broker meeting will typically occur within 2-4 weeks after release, as this is a critical window for re-engagement in care, underscored by the fact that this is also a high-risk period for increased unprotected sex and return to substance use. Per DOORS' standard practice, the broker will complete a comprehensive needs assessment with the participant. Based on these assessments, together with the participant, the broker will develop a personalized re-entry plan with a detailed list of referrals and calendar of scheduled visits with relevant agencies within the DOORS network. Follow-up visits and assessments: Research visits will be scheduled at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. A 4-week window before and 8-week window after the target follow-up dates will be permitted for study assessments. Assessments will be completed at each follow-up visit, including substance use, adherence, healthcare utilization and recidivism, with blood draw for HIV viral load collected at the 6-month visit. In order to maximize efficient utilization of resources, for baseline and other follow-up visits, HIV viral load will be abstracted from medical records. In order to have sufficient time to enroll and complete 12 month study visits for the 80 participants in Aim 2, the 5 pilot participants from Aim 1.3 need to reach at least the 3 month time point but not 6 or 12-month visits before beginning study enrollment for Aim 2. Pilot participants will complete through 12-month visits as this will provide insight as to how best to conduct these later follow-up visits. All participants will receive financial reimbursement for study visits ($25 for each visit), unless they are incarcerated at the time of the visit. Jail inmates are not permitted to receive any financial incentives during incarceration. AIM 2: Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the collaborative intervention (n=40) compared to treatment as usual (n=40) in HIV+ substance users released from jail. Introduction. In this aim, we will test the CHW-DOORS intervention that was refined in Aim 1 in a randomized fashion. The goal of this aim is to establish feasibility of a randomized controlled trial in this setting, to determine preliminary efficacy of the intervention and to inform sample size calculations for a fully powered trial. In addition, this aim will provide data regarding key factors involved in HIV+ substance users accessing substance use treatment and HIV care after jail release. Our working hypothesis is that from the stakeholder input and pilot testing completed in Aim 1, we will be able to successfully conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial and gain valuable insight into key predisposing and enabling factors influencing healthcare needs and utilization in this population, and how these may impact HIV viral load, substance use and recidivism. Research Design. Potential participants will be referred to the research study by Dallas County jail medical providers as described in Aim 1.3. Candidates who agree to be approached will be contacted by a RA who will recruit, and review eligibility criteria (see Aim 1.3). After release, potential participants will be contacted in order to complete informed consent, study enrollment and randomization (to be completed within 30 days of release from jail). All participants will provide 2 specific forms of locator information (telephone number for themselves, friend/family member, address, email, specific location where they may be located to aid in retention efforts). Participants will complete baseline assessments and will then be randomized to the intervention CHW-DOORS versus treatment as usual (TAU). Randomization will occur by random assignment using a computer program, without block randomization given the small sample size. TAU participants will receive standard of care, which involves passive referral by jail medical staff to the outpatient HIV clinic. Intervention. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will meet with the CHW and a staff member from DOORS as outlined in Aim 1.3. Any modifications to this protocol after pilot testing in Aim 1.3 will be implemented in Aim 2. The general premise will be the same, where the DOORS broker will complete a needs assessment, generate an individualized re-entry plan and make referrals to providers in the extensive DOORS network. The CHW will assist the participant in navigating these referrals, specifically with regards to HIV care, substance use treatment and mental healthcare. The measurement of the intervention will be as noted in Aim 1.3, with the DOORS broker following routine agency processes for referrals and measurement using the PIECES technology program and the CHW will record specifics (where, when, duration) of each visit and what was addressed during these intervention visits. Study Assessments. All participants will complete baseline assessments prior to randomization and will have follow-up visits at 3, 6 and 12 months as noted in Aim 1.3. A blood draw will be performed for 6-month HIV viral load. Follow-up visits will assess HIV viral load (abstracted from medical record for all visits other than 6 month), substance use (using ASSIST), healthcare utilization including attendance of HIV clinic visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and reincarceration. If individuals are reincarcerated at the Dallas County Jail at the time of the follow-up visits, an attempt will be made to complete study visits at the jail.

Beta blockers (BB) and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) have been used to prevent rebleeding in these patients, largely based on data from cirrhotic patients. Endotherapy in the form of EST has been well studied in preventing rebleed in patients with NCPH. Initial studies showed that EST significantly reduced the rebleeding rate in patients of NCPH. Data from these studies suggests a rebleed rate of approximately 25% at 2yr and 35% at 5 years.

Beta blockers have been found to be quite effective in both primary as well as secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic and are accepted mode of treatment. In contrast to liver cirrhosis, published data on the effect of beta blocker therapy on NCPH are scanty.

Research Design: This is a prospective cross-sectional study.

Methodology/Technical Approach: The proposed study will examine multiple biomarkers in a group of 100 individuals who have not had an episode of EHS and a prospective study of 50 persons who have had an EHS event. Control subjects will have biomarker assessments before and after an exercise challenge under thermoneutral (TTT) and thermally challenged conditions (heat tolerance test/HTT); differences in the responses to the two tests will be attributed to the heat.

If they are heat tolerant at 6-weeks as determined by a HTT, subsequent measures will include only blood samples and questionnaires, whereas if they are heat intolerant (HIT) at 6-weeks, subsequent measures will include additional HTTs, along with blood samples and questionnaires. As our previous data indicate, approximately 20% of non-EHS persons are HIT; we will test 100 non-EHS and 50 EHI persons in this study. Thus, data will be evaluated with regard to thermotolerance.

Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,OTHER,NCT03511079,Music as a Perioperative Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients,Impact of Perioperative Music on Quality of Life Measures and Biomarker Levels in Breast Cancer Patients,"Music has often been used in hospitals as a therapy but there is a limited amount of research looking at how music actually affects the different molecules in the body, such as cortisol (a marker of stress). There is especially a lack of research in the context of surgery. The hope is that this study will show that music can be used to minimize some of the side effects related to breast surgery and improve the patient experience.","In medical practice, an ideal therapy should have maximal benefit with minimal risk. While considerable effort is being placed into discovering more effective pharmaceuticals, there is a growing field of interest in alternative therapies. In the 1970's, George Engle put forward the idea of the biopsychosocial response in which the patient's social and psychological factors can influence the body's biologic function and vice versa. One such potential therapy that could work by this mechanism is music. Advantages of music include low cost, availability, no required expertise, and minimal side effects. Studies have shown that music leads to reduced postoperative pain, anxiety, and analgesic needs in surgical patients. It has also been shown that patient selected music has greater outcomes than researcher selected music. While there is a significant body of literature on changes in clinical measurements, there are only two studies known to us which try to examine the effects of music on a molecular level, measuring cortisol and blood glucose respectively. Neither of these studies have been performed in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer.

On the other hand, considerable research is currently being conducted to determine biomarkers in the context of surgery that are associated with poor outcomes, especially in the context of breast surgery. Stress, usually associated with cortisol levels, has been associated with increased sleep disruption, increased metabolism, increased risk of thromboembolic events, and impaired wound healing in patients. In breast cancer patients, it has been found that C-reactive protein levels correlated in fatigue postoperatively and decreased diurnal variation in cortisol has been associated with depression. Melatonin, in general, is a marker for circadian rhythm and would also be representative of sleep disruption. C-reactive protein is primarily a marker of inflammation which in turn is associated with disease progression and poorer clinical outcomes in breast surgery patients.

This study aims to determine both if music affects molecular mechanisms through measurement of clinical biomarkers as well as if there is an association with significant quality of life measures. A positive association could provide evidence into music being used as an adjunct therapy peri-operatively.","Inclusion Criteria:

The proposed study will be consisting of two main segments:

The primary aim of segment 1 of the study is data collection and calibration of the Hypo Sense sensor prototype compared to standard invasive reference glucometer.

The primary aim of segment 2 of the study is to validate the Hypo Sense prototype performance in detecting hypoglycemic events.

During the first segment of the study we intend to collect in parallel measurements of blood glucose using reference method (capillary glucometer) and continuous data generated by the non- invasive study device during approximately 4 hours, in which a hypoglycemic event will be induced.

The reference and study device data will be analyzed using multivariate regression model to formulate a calibration algorithm model. This model will translate the set of the physiological recorded parameters into detection of hypoglycemic events.

Hacettepe University,OTHER,NCT05325879,Relationship of Cervical Region Tension With Vagal Function,Investigation of the Relationship of Cervical Region Tension With Vagal Function and Gastrointestinal Symptoms,"The increase in the tension of the soft tissues around a nerve restricts the movement, affects the function of the nerve, and makes the nerve vulnerable to entrapment. Even a mild nerve compression can cause entrapment and lead to neuroinflammation. It is known that inflammatory mediators amplify axonal sensitivity. Although the spontaneous discharge potential of visceral afferents is quite low under normal conditions, neuroinflammation increases the excitability of these fibers. With this mechanism, hyperalgesia may develop in sensory fibers in neuroinflammation. This may cause pathologies in the organs innervated by the relevant nerve.

The fascia and muscles of the cervical region surround the vagus nerve. There are two main fascial compartments in the cervical region. The SCM and trapezius muscle fascias join to the most superficial fascia of the deep cervical fascia and they together form these compartments. These fasciae superiorly attach to the cranium and inferiorly to the pectoral region. The vagus nerve emerges from the jugular foramen together with the 9th and 11th cranial nerves. It then continues through the carotid sheath in the cervical region. The carotid sheath is in contact with the SCM muscle. For this reason, it can be thought that SCM muscle tension or thickness may affect the carotid sheath and thus the function of the vagus nerve passing through it.

In summary, deterioration in vagus nerve activity plays a role in pathologies of the organs innervated by the vagus. Although the relationship between vagal dysfunction and gastrointestinal system symptoms is clear, the mechanisms affecting vagus nerve function have not yet been clarified. It has been reported in the literature that some maneuvers from the cervical region are also effective on the vagus nerve. Also, according to investigators' clinical experience, gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with increased cervical soft tissue tension. However, there are not enough studies investigating whether the cervical region soft tissue tension can affect the gastrointestinal system via the vagus nerve. Therefore, this study was planned to examine the relationship of cervical soft tissue tension with vagus nerve function and gastrointestinal symptoms in asymptomatic individuals and individuals with neck pain.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

John van den Anker,OTHER,NCT01327079,The Use of Methadone in Newborn Infants,Optimizing the Use of Methadone in Newborn Infants,"This proposed investigation will test the following hypotheses: 1) Enzymatic activity of CYP2B6 characterized by the formation clearance of methadone to EDDP (CLf,EDDP), is directly related to both gestational and postnatal age; 2) variations in the CYP2B6 gene (SNPs) are associated with variable activity of the CYP2B6 enzyme (as measured by the formation clearance, CLf,EDDP), and 3) the elimination rate of methadone and its major metabolite EDDP in neonates is dependent on the glomerular filtration rate and therefore on the stage of development (defined by both gestational and postnatal age). The investigators propose to develop a PK model for methadone dosing in neonates that takes into account both developmental stage and genetic variability. The long-term goal of the proposed investigations is to improve dosing of methadone in neonates exposed to opioids in utero or post-natally, leading to improved control of their withdrawal syndrome and decreased adverse drug reactions associated with the current use of methadone in these vulnerable patients. More immediately, the investigators will develop a PK model for methadone dosing based on relevant developmental and genetic characteristics. The acquired knowledge based on the proposed study will lead to a more efficacious treatment of pain or opiate withdrawal syndrome in newborn infants with a decreased chance of adverse drug reactions.","The investigators will identify and recruit from the NICU of CNMC 60 preterm neonates uniformly distributed with respect to gestational age and encompassing GA's of from 22 to less than 43 weeks.

University of Pennsylvania,OTHER,NCT00520884,Ghrelin in Healthy and Frail Older Women,A Pilot Study of Ghrelin in Healthy and Frail Older Women,"The purpose of this research study is to see if giving women a hormone called ""ghrelin"" will increase levels of growth hormone in the blood and increase appetite. Ghrelin is a naturally occurring hormone that is produced mostly by the stomach and causes secretion of another hormone called growth hormone. It also increases short-term appetite and may lower the amount of inflammation in the body.

Some people lose their appetite as they age and have unintentional weight loss. This may be caused by a break in the communication between the stomach and the brain. We are particularly interested in seeing if there is a difference in the effects of ghrelin in older women who have lost weight recently without wanting to and those who have not.","Five community-dwelling women aged 70 or over with unintentional weight loss of \>5% in the prior year plus at least 2 of the 4 remaining Fried criteria for frailty and five healthy women without any frailty criteria were enrolled. Women with conditions that can cause weight loss or taking an appetite stimulant or corticosteroids were excluded. Each woman completed two 180 minute infusions, one week apart, assigned randomly: a graded ghrelin infusion of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 pmol/kg/min for 60 minutes each and an equivalent placebo (saline) infusion. A meal of standardized composition was provided after each infusion and intake quantified. Samples were collected every 30 minutes for growth hormone (GH), and total and active ghrelin. Additional samples were collected every 60 minutes for glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1), and cortisol. Adverse events were collected during the infusion and by telephone 24 hours later. Non-parametric methods were used to compare differences in response to the ghrelin and placebo infusions 1) in all women and 2) between frail and healthy women.","Inclusion Criteria:

Ghrelin is a naturally occurring hormone that is produced mostly by the stomach and causes secretion of another hormone called growth hormone. It also increases short-term appetite and may lower the amount of inflammation in the body. Some people lose their appetite as they age and have unintentional weight loss. This may be caused by a break in the communication between the stomach and the brain. We are particularly interested in seeing if there is a difference in the effects of ghrelin in older women who have lost weight recently without wanting to and those who have not. Five community-dwelling women aged 70 or over with unintentional weight loss of \>5% in the prior year plus at least 2 of the 4 remaining Fried criteria for frailty and five healthy women without any frailty criteria were enrolled. Women with conditions that can cause weight loss or taking an appetite stimulant or corticosteroids were excluded. Each woman completed two 180 minute infusions, one week apart, assigned randomly: a graded ghrelin infusion of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 pmol/kg/min for 60 minutes each and an equivalent placebo (saline) infusion. A meal of standardized composition was provided after each infusion and intake quantified. Samples were collected every 30 minutes for growth hormone (GH), and total and active ghrelin. Additional samples were collected every 60 minutes for glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1), and cortisol. Adverse events were collected during the infusion and by telephone 24 hours later. Non-parametric methods were used to compare differences in response to the ghrelin and placebo infusions 1) in all women and 2) between frail and healthy women.

Vanderbilt University,OTHER,NCT00653484,Energy Balance Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Prevention,Energy Balance Interventions for Colorectal Cancer Prevention,"RATIONALE: Calories and physical exercise may affect the risk of developing cancer. It is not yet known whether a low-calorie diet and/or physical activity program is effective in preventing cancer in participants at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying diet and physical activity in healthy overweight, obese, or inactive participants at risk of developing colorectal cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* To compare four 12-week energy-balance interventions comprising a physical activity intervention (+2,000 kcal/wk), a dietary energy restriction intervention (DER)(-2,000 kcal/wk), or a combined physical activity and DER intervention (+1,000/-1,000 kcal/wk) vs no intervention in healthy, overweight, or moderately obese participants at increased risk for developing colorectal cancer.
* To quantify changes in circulating biomarkers (e.g., insulin, IGF-1, leptin, c-reactive protein, or isoprostanes) proposed to mediate the anticarcinogenic effects of DER in these participants.

OUTLINE: This study consists of a 2-week run-in period (baseline) followed by a 12-week intervention period.

Participants undergo three study visits at Vanderbilt University General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). Beginning at study visit 1, participants undergo a 2-week run-in period to obtain baseline measures of body composition (via dual x-ray absorptiometry), cardiorespiratory fitness (via treadmill testing), physical activity, dietary intake, energy expenditure, and metabolic activity. Dietary assessments using 24-hour dietary recalls are conducted by the GCRC dietitian during the run-in period. GCRC dietitians complete three 24-hour recalls on randomly selected days during the 2-week assessment period to provide an estimate of the participant's habitual food intake at baseline. Baseline energy needs are assessed during activity monitored run-in period to obtain measures of the participant's resting energy expenditure and total daily energy expenditure. Participants are also assessed using a brief psychological profile that is used to individualize the study intervention for each participant.

Approximately 10-14 days after the initial visit and after all baseline assessments have been completed, participants undergo a second study visit. Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms.

* Arm I (physical activity): Participants undergo an in-person, 30- to 60-minute counseling visit, followed by five brief 10- to 15-minute telephone-counseling calls over 12 weeks. During the initial counseling session, participants learn about goal setting and how to develop a personalized plan for meeting their intervention goals. Participants are instructed about wearing proper shoes and about monitoring their exercise duration and intensity. Participants are also given pedometers to help track their activity patterns and to monitor their progress in meeting program objectives. Participants must wear the pedometers for 7 days at baseline and again at 12 weeks. The information provided is used to estimate overall physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), steps per day, and time spent in different levels of activity.

Participants are monitored periodically for adherence to the exercise program through behavioral counseling and self-reported logs of daily exercise and pedometer steps. Dietary intake is measured periodically using multiple 24-hour dietary recalls to carefully assess possible changes in energy intake and dietary quality over the course of the study.

* Arm II (dietary energy restriction \[DER\]): Based on the initial estimate of energy needs determined during the run-in period, participants receive a reduced-calorie, food exchange-based diet for 12 weeks. Each diet is individualized to achieve the desired daily energy deficit of 300 calories per day based on physical activity levels. All meals are prepared by the GCRC metabolic kitchen. Participants receive one multivitamin per day and no other nutritional supplements. Fluids including coffee, water, and other drinks are allowed at the pre-study level. Each week, participants meet with the dietitian to discuss the participant's progress, submit daily reports of food intake, return uneaten food items, and to provide urine samples for assessment of urinary biomarkers.

Adherence to the diet is monitored by compliance with food pick-up, dietary records, and measures of urinary metabolites. Participants are also provided with individual instruction, counseling, and assessment by the study dietitian.

* Arm III (physical activity and DER): Participants undergo a 12-week DER and physical-activity program, as described in arms I and II, with the exception that the dose of PAEE and DER in the combined intervention (i.e., +1,000/-1,000 kcal/week) is half that of each individual intervention (+2,000 kcal/week for arm I and -2,000 kcal/week for arm II). Participants in arm III receive an individualized reduced-calorie diet designed to achieve a desired daily energy deficit of 150 calories per day based on participant physical activity levels.
* Arm IV (wait-list control): Participants are followed periodically. At study visit 3, after completion of the 12-week study interventions, participants undergo repeat assessment of body composition, fitness, diet, and activity measures.

Participants undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and at 12 weeks for correlative laboratory studies. Blood samples are assessed for circulating biomarkers that are involved in energy homeostasis and metabolic control (e.g., insulin, IGF, and leptin) and inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., c-reactive protein, PGE-2, and isoprostanes). Urine samples are examined for biomarkers of dietary protein intake (i.e., nitrogen content), dietary sodium, and potassium intake.

Participants complete the Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline and at 12 weeks for assessment of PAEE through non-occupational activities, including social activities, recreation, hobbies, housework, walking, jogging, and 14 other types of exercise.","Inclusion Criteria:

The treatment with TKI has become a new standard-of-care for patient with advanced lung cancer and EGFR or ALK changes. Several novel mutations, which are candidates as targets for specific medication have been discovered. Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2, erbB-2/neu) is a protein of the so called ErbB family (including HER2 \[ErbB2\], ErbB3 and ErbB4).

Afatinib works by blocking the activity of the ErbB family proteins and can inhibit growth and spread of cancer cells. Afatinib is approved by the European and the Swiss Medicines Agencies for the treatment of adult patients with a specific type of cancer of the lung (non-small cell lung cancer) that is identified by a change (mutation) in the gene for EGFR as first treatment or if prior chemotherapy treatment has been insufficient.

Damascus University,OTHER,NCT02203279,Evaluation of Three Hard Relining Materials in Complete Dentures,Evaluation of Three Hard Relining Materials in Complete Dentures: An In-vivo Study,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate three hard relining materials after 3 and 6 months of use with mandibular complete dentures. The effect of hard relining materials on supporting tissues and patients' satisfaction will also be assessed.

Materials and Methods: 36 complete edentulous patients who already have maxillary dentures and complaining of instable mandibular dentures will be invited to participate in this study. Mandibular dentures will be relined randomly by one of three relining materials: two chairside relining materials (Tokuyama Rebase II Fast, Tokuyama Dental Co, Japan), and (Flexacryl Hard, Lang Co, USA) and one heat cured acrylic resin (Vertex, Dental technology Co, Holland).

The color stability of relining material, peeling, and the effect on supporting tissue will be assessed by two separate prosthodontists after 3 and 6 months of follow up. In addition, patients will be asked to grade there overall satisfaction on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100.","Relining denture is a process of resurfacing the tissue side of a denture to make it fit more accurately Direct relining of removable dentures with hard chair-side reline materials is suitable for improving the fit of the denture bases to the supporting tissues. Chairside reline materials are more convenient than those processed in a laboratory because the direct method is faster and does not cause clinically significant dimensional changes of the reline resin. However, when autopolymerized reline resins are used with a direct method, several problems can occur as burning sensation caused by monomers, an exothermic heat reaction and an unpleasant odor.

There are three types of hard relining chair-side materials: Dual-polymerized Visible light-polymerized as Triad DuaLine, Light Liner (Hard), Astron LC (Hard).Visible light-polymerized as Lightdon-U, Triad Hi-Flow Reline Material, Triad VLC Reline Material. Finally, autopolymerized as New Truline, Tokuyama Rebase II (Fast) , GC Reline. Other concerns related to direct reline materials include patient tolerance (taste, temperature, odor), color stability, durability and ease of handling and polishing.

Few studies evaluated the effect of disinfection solutions on relining materials properties as roughness and hardness. In one study, disinfectant solutions caused a decrease in hardness, whereas with roughness, the materials tested showed a statistically significant increase, except for Tokuyama. Depending on the examined relining materials, some materials have increased and the others have decreased surface roughness after immersion in disinfecting solutions or microwave disinfection.

All previous laboratory studies concentrated on the effects of disinfection on relining materials properties as roughness, hardness, color change. However, the clinical studies did not compare chemically cured and heat cured relining materials and their effects on supporting tissue. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of two -chemically cured- and heat cured denture relining material after 3 and 6 months of use. In addition, the effect of hard relining materials on supporting tissues, and patients' satisfaction has not been evaluated yet.","Inclusion Criteria:

Finally, autopolymerized as New Truline, Tokuyama Rebase II (Fast) , GC Reline. Other concerns related to direct reline materials include patient tolerance (taste, temperature, odor), color stability, durability and ease of handling and polishing. Few studies evaluated the effect of disinfection solutions on relining materials properties as roughness and hardness. In one study, disinfectant solutions caused a decrease in hardness, whereas with roughness, the materials tested showed a statistically significant increase, except for Tokuyama. Depending on the examined relining materials, some materials have increased and the others have decreased surface roughness after immersion in disinfecting solutions or microwave disinfection. All previous laboratory studies concentrated on the effects of disinfection on relining materials properties as roughness, hardness, color change. However, the clinical studies did not compare chemically cured and heat cured relining materials and their effects on supporting tissue. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of two -chemically cured- and heat cured denture relining material after 3 and 6 months of use. In addition, the effect of hard relining materials on supporting tissues, and patients' satisfaction has not been evaluated yet.

Nantes University Hospital,OTHER,NCT04600479,Study on the Prevalence of Hepatitis C In a psychiatRic Population,Study on the Prevalence of Hepatitis C In a psychiatRic Population,"Viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis C, is a major public health issue. Nowadays, very few studies in France have evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis C in a psychiatric environment.

In 2019, at the time of new treatments for HCV, it therefore seems essential to update the available data by estimating the prevalence of chronic active hepatitis C in psychiatric population. In addition to an update of epidemiological data, it is of high importance to assess the effectiveness of the care pathway for patients in whom chronic active hepatitis C is diagnosed, including the cascade of care, currently too inefficient despite treatments that are themselves ultra-efficient. Indeed, it is essential that once hepatitis is detected, it is formally diagnosed, then that the patient actually starts care and is adherent to treatment (take his treatment according to the prescription and until the end: this implies that the patient accepts his or her illness and understands the value of the prescribed treatments), to hope to cure the infection.

In this context, the SaPHIR study will allow to test a systematic screening of patients in an adult psychiatric environment, through rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). The objective is to promote the adherence of patients, and to assess possible obstacles in order to optimize the screening (RDTs), diagnosis (confirmation of only positive RDTs by venous sampling) and care management circuits in routine practice. In addition, the study envisages a combined HCV-HBV-HIV screening, taking into account the cross-infection risk (same mode of contamination, same risk population, frequent co-infections, more severe liver pathology in case of co-infection, etc.), thus making it possible to take care of the patient as a whole. The results of the SaPHIR study can ultimately be sent to the French health authorities to improve screening and care circuits, and their coverage by social security.","Participation in the SaPHIR study will be offered to patients admitted to one of the inpatient or outpatient adult psychiatric units of the hospitals participating in the study (around Nantes), provided that the realization of the RDTs will be possible.

Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki,OTHER,NCT02725879,FGF-21 Levels and RMR in Children and Adolescents With Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (THYROMETABOL),"Association of Serum Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF-21) Levels With Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), in Children and Adolescents With Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.","It is well documented that thyroid hormones (THs) are involved in energy and lipid metabolism, thermogenesis, and body weight control, acting on several tissues. Thus, any change in thyroid status may affect body weight and metabolic rate. On the other hand, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) is a complex hormone involved in energy, lipid, and glucose metabolism, sharing common biochemical pathways and sites of action with THs. FGF-21 is synthesized and acts primarily on the liver, but weaker expression has also been described in muscle, pancreas, and adipose tissue. In addition, FGF-21 acts through endocrine and paracrine mechanisms, regulating metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, and thermogenesis. Recent animal and human studies have highlighted a close bidirectional relationship between FGF-21 and THs, partially elucidated. Thyroid hormones regulate the expression of the FGF-21 gene in the liver and can also increase FGF-21 levels in vivo. However, it has also been suggested that some of their key actions are largely independent. Data on FGF-21 levels and their metabolic role in pediatric patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) are scarce. This study aims to measure FGF-21 serum levels in children and adolescents with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and investigate any possible associations between FGF-21 serum levels and resting metabolic rate (RMR) and levothyroxine (LT4) treatment, or other clinical and biochemical parameters.","Children and adolescents, aged 5-18 years, will undergo routine screening for chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) at the Pediatric Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic of ""Papageorgiou"" General Hospital and ""AHEPA"" University Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece. The diagnosis of AIT will be based on the presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies (Anti-TPOAb and/or Anti-TgAb) and one or more of the following: clinical symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, goiter, or diffuse/irregular hypoechogenicity of the thyroid gland during an ultrasound examination.

All participants should have a normal body mass index (BMI) for their age and sex, be drug-naive for at least 3 months, follow no special diet, and have no chronic and/or acute disease or menstrual disorder. Only those subjects that will start routine LT4 treatment will be reassessed at six months (not the rest participants), with no specific intervention to take place during those six months.

For all participants, a detailed medical history will be recorded. The following parameters will be measured and calculated: age and pubertal stage according to Tanner, height, body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and skinfolds measurement in order to estimate the percentage of body fat (%BF). The resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be measured with a portable device applying indirect calorimetry. Blood samples will be collected after overnight fasting.

The following parameters will be tested in serum: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (Anti-TPOAb) titers, thyroglobulin antibody (Anti-TgAb) titers, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γglutamyltransferase (γ-GT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), applying an automatic chemical analyzer or immunoassay system and analogs reagents that already exist at the hospital. Serum FGF-21 levels will be determined in pg/mL using the Solid Phase Sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Additionally, all participants, with the help of their parents and/or caregivers, will complete the Mediterranean Diet Index (KIDMED) at their first visit.","Inclusion Criteria:

It is well documented that thyroid hormones (THs) are involved in energy and lipid metabolism, thermogenesis, and body weight control, acting on several tissues. Thus, any change in thyroid status may affect body weight and metabolic rate. On the other hand, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) is a complex hormone involved in energy, lipid, and glucose metabolism, sharing common biochemical pathways and sites of action with THs. FGF-21 is synthesized and acts primarily on the liver, but weaker expression has also been described in muscle, pancreas, and adipose tissue. In addition, FGF-21 acts through endocrine and paracrine mechanisms, regulating metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, and thermogenesis. Recent animal and human studies have highlighted a close bidirectional relationship between FGF-21 and THs, partially elucidated. Thyroid hormones regulate the expression of the FGF-21 gene in the liver and can also increase FGF-21 levels in vivo. However, it has also been suggested that some of their key actions are largely independent. Data on FGF-21 levels and their metabolic role in pediatric patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) are scarce. This study aims to measure FGF-21 serum levels in children and adolescents with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and investigate any possible associations between FGF-21 serum levels and resting metabolic rate (RMR) and levothyroxine (LT4) treatment, or other clinical and biochemical parameters.

The study covers 2x2 + 1 month of prevention in 120 randomized participants following a tight sampling set-up for sensitive detection of viral infections by RT-qPCR analysis of nasal swabs and seroconversion of SARS-CoV2 IgG/IgM in serum samples.

Study flyers are presented in waiting rooms at GPs/hospitals locally and study information is forwarded via the study centre network to attract interest of potential participants. Altogether, 140 participants shall be recruited (screened) by the study. Interested persons shall be invited to the study centre for first informative visit 1 (V1). Participants encountering acute symptoms during screening and/or run-in phase can be included as well. The number of recurrences that can be treated and documented per participant during the time of observation in this study is in principal unlimited. Participants are equipped with study product and study diaries sufficient to encounter a max of 3 individual respiratory tract infections ""RTI"".

The commercially available study product ""Echinaforce Chewable ""EC"" tablets shall be compared to no treatment in study participants that were randomized equally to the two study groups: 1) ""Treatment group"" and 2) ""no-treatment group"". Participants assigned to the ""treatment group"" are instructed to perform 2 consecutive prevention periods taking 3x2 EC tablets daily for 2x2 months followed by a voluntary, 1 month follow up prevention in frame of this study. After each 2 month prevention phase, participant interrupted prevention for 1 week before starting with a new phase. Intake of regular preventive supplements is recorded as per eCRF entries (V1-V7) and intake of co-medication to treat acute RTI symptoms as per study diary entries. Participants should contact the study coordinator as soon as possible upon first signs of acute cold-/flu like symptoms. The study coordinator confirms the symptoms and instructs participants to start taking 5x2 instead of 3x2 EC tablets daily immediately.

Quality assurance:

Informed Consent Forms, individual e-CRFs accounts and paper study diaries, investigator records, medical test results, and study product must be accessible at all times to study monitors commissioned by the CRO (CONVEX CRO Ltd.) on behalf of and mandated by the sponsor.

Sample size assessment:

A sample size calculation has been conducted on the main study parameter, which is the incidence of RTIs during the time of observation. A difference between both study groups of at least 20.5% will be recognized as significant clinically relevant (two-group Chi-square test with a 0.05 two sided significance level) with a power of 80% with an incidence rate of 10% seen under active treatment and at least 60 participants included evaluable per study group (chi²-test, nquery advisor 7.0). In addition, for the pharmacological parameters assessed in the study it is estimated that 80% power is achieved with cross-sectional and longitudinal sampling to detect CpG DNA methylation differences of 20%.Amendments to the protocol

SAP:

For planning the statistical analysis and reporting in this clinical study the ICH guidelines for ""biostatistical methodology in clinical trials"" are taken into account. The details of the statistical methodology (including the handling of missing and incorrect data) are presented in detail in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP).

Descriptive parameters are determined for assessed clinical variables. In addition to the absolute and relative frequencies of the score values, the arithmetic mean, median, first and third quartile (Q1 or Q3), standard deviation, minimum and maximum of the current value and the changes in comparison between ""treatment group"" and ""no treatment group"", are calculated. All assessed target variables are exploratory evaluated using suitable test methods (Mantel-Haenszel test for ordinal variables, Fisher's exact/Chi-Square test for dichotomous or categorical variables and t-test or analysis of variance for quantitative target variables) in the ""treatment group"" compared to ""no treatment group"".

The safety assessment is based on the recording of adverse events (AEs), adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as per entries in the e-CRF and ultimately the subjective assessment of tolerability and acceptance by the study investigators and participants.","Inclusion Criteria:

University of Melbourne,OTHER,NCT02629484,Trial of Focused Cardiac Ultrasound for Fractured Neck of Femur Surgery,"A Pilot Study to Assess Feasibility, Compliance, Safety and Group Separation for a Multicentre Randomised Trial of Preoperative Focused Cardiac Ultrasound for Fractured Neck of Femur Surgery","Hip fracture surgery is a major world health care burden and concern, as it has a large and increasing prevalence and carries very high patient mortality, disability and community health care cost. As the commonest cause of mortality is from cardiac complications, and cardiac disease is prevalent and frequently missed by standard care, we hypothesise that earlier and more accurate diagnosis and treatment of cardiac pathology in this cohort will lead to improved outcome. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) is a new increasingly popular technique used by doctors that enables earlier and more accurate diagnosis of cardiac disorders that can be performed routinely before hip fracture surgery. Our preliminary data of 64 patients demonstrated that routine FCU before surgery lead to a change in cardiac diagnosis and management in 50% of patients requiring hip fracture surgery, which was associated with a 50% reduction in mortality 12 months after surgery compared with controls. It is therefore important for a large randomised trial to be performed to confirm or rebuke these findings, as if true, would have a very large impact on health care and may also improve health care and outcome in other high-risk surgical populations. The proposed pilot study is a pilot study which aims to establish feasibility, safety, compliance and group separation prior to commencing a definitive multicentre trial.","Aims and Hypotheses Aims

1. To determine whether routine preoperative focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) leads to a reduced composite outcome of death, major adverse cardiac events, and acute renal failure (adverse composite outcome) 30 days after hip fracture surgery compared to patients who do not receive preoperative FCU (current standard of care).
2. To identify the changes in team management of the patient due to FCU that are associated with improved outcome, compared to current standard of care.
3. To determine whether routine preoperative FCU is more cost-effective than current standard of care.

Hypotheses

1. FCU reduces adverse composite outcome by at least 20%, 30 days after hip fracture surgery.
2. FCU leads to changes in cardiac diagnosis, and subsequent changes to perioperative and post-discharge management plans, which are associated with improved outcome compared to current standard of care.
3. Routine FCU before hip fracture surgery is more cost-effective than current standard of care.

Identifying cardiovascular disease: Preoperative cardiac assessment, which enables improved cardiac treatment and reduction of cardiac complications, is recommended by the American Heart Association. However, cardiovascular disease is often unrecognised and under-diagnosed in this age group because of frailty, general immobility, and the high frequency of poor cognitive function including dementia, which inhibits accurate clinical assessment. Careful cardiac assessment and treatment is often not undertaken because of the belief that surgery should be performed urgently and a delay for cardiac investigations may worsen outcome.

Cardiac risk factors for death after hip fracture surgery (cardiac failure, aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy) cannot be reliably diagnosed with clinical examination and require echocardiography (FCU or transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)). Although a pulmonary embolus cannot be reliably diagnosed with echocardiography, the haemodynamic effects from a significant pulmonary embolus are readily seen (right ventricular dilatation and failure). Currently, preoperative TTE is only used in selected patients, based on the clinical assessment and the opinion of the clinician as to whether it is justified. If the anaesthetist reviews the patient just prior to surgery and is concerned about cardiovascular disease, there is a lot of pressure to proceed with booked surgery due to the current belief that early surgery saves lives, rather than to delay surgery for a TTE. Treatment is therefore often based on ""best guess"" clinical assessment. This management approach may lead to inadequate treatment with resultant hypotension, leading to organ failure and death.

Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FCU): The conventional TTE investigation is ordered by the treating doctor, performed by a technician and reported by a cardiologist or radiologist at a later time. The TTE provides detailed information on structure and function of all of the valves and chambers and is also referred to as diagnostic echocardiography. A TTE or other complex cardiovascular investigation leads to delay, as the process of obtaining a TTE and then waiting for the report may take days depending on resource availability. Any echocardiography examination is a ""snapshot"" in time, and heart function can change between the performance of the TTE and the commencement of surgery. A FCU utilises the same echocardiography techniques as conventional TTE but is performed as a bedside test by the treating doctor to answer a clinical question to aid clinical decision-making in real time. It provides specific information relevant to perioperative care in time for acute resuscitation and potentially life-saving decision-making.

A type of FCU, iHeartScanTM , that is specifically designed for critical and perioperative care has been developed by the Ultrasound Education Group at The University of Melbourne. FCU has been confirmed to be as accurate as comprehensive TTE for purposes of acute clinical care. FCU has been endorsed by The American Society of Echocardiography and embraced by the critical care community.

The case for equipoise: The conventional approach to proceed to early surgery without delay for cardiovascular investigations is contrary to the proof-of-concept data that preoperative FCU may reduce mortality through the provision of better cardiovascular diagnostic information, leading to management changes. The use of conventional TTE, however, causes considerable delay to surgery, which may increase mortality risk. FCU has the advantage of providing improved diagnosis without causing substantial delay to surgery, and can therefore is additive to rather than competitive with current ""best practice"". An economic analysis of routine FCU has not been performed.

Feasibility of the trial - the ECHONOF II trial In the preliminary study, feasibility of routine FCU in hip fracture surgery was demonstrated, with more than one patient per week at one centre. To determine feasibility of the proposed outcome randomised controlled trial (RCT) a pilot study of feasibility, safety, protocol compliance and group separation will be conducted in 2016 at 4-5 sites across Australia, with the lead site at Royal Melbourne Hospital. The pilot study analysis will include patients recruited who have 30-day data available a in 2016, though data will continue to be collected out to 12 months.

The pilot study protocol will be the same as the proposed (future) definitive clinical trial , but the endpoints are aimed at assessing feasibility and compliance.

Research protocol Trial Design: A parallel group, randomised controlled, multicentre trial with 1:1 allocation ratio.

Participants: Patients presenting with isolated, primary, non-metastatic fractured neck of femur, where surgery is expected within 48 hours after hospital admission will be recruited. Patients with prior hip surgery on the affected side, or where the cause is likely to be due to metastatic cancer, or where survival is unlikely in the 24 hours from admission will not be included.

Settings and Locations: teaching and regional hospitals in Australia with a high volume of hip fracture surgery and the necessary equipment and expertise to perform FCU have agreed to participate.

Intervention: Participants randomised to the FCU group will receive a preoperative FCU performed by an independent operator within 24 hours of planned surgery, following The University of Melbourne iHeartScanTM protocol. Patients randomised to the standard care group will not undergo FCU before surgery.

There are no restrictions on the treating team in either group determining what management they will employ, including anaesthesia technique, surgical management, perioperative care and preoperative investigations including comprehensive TTE by the cardiology department. However the treatment of patients will be recorded, allowing comparison of the effect of FCU on diagnosis and management between groups.

The control group will represent the standard of care in each of the participating hospitals. This typically includes early surgery with minimal preoperative investigations. Some patients, however, based on the clinical assessment of their treating doctors, will have additional investigations such as comprehensive TTE, which could result in changes in management including an associated delay in surgery. This trial will not interfere with the standard of care management, and, once recruited, patients will remain in the standard of care group even if they receive comprehensive TTE or have delayed surgery. Treatment in both groups will be according to individual and institutional practice, working with the diagnostic information available at the time.

Randomisation: Randomisation codes will be in blocks using a web-based automatic enrolment system to participating institutions in order to facilitate recruitment across different time zones and out-of-hours cases. Patients will be stratified to severity of surgery (hip replacement/hemiarthroplasty, or femoral fixation) and institution (tertiary referral, or non-tertiary metropolitan/ regional hospitals). The randomisation sequence will be generated using a computer random sequence generator for each strata in blocks of 10 to ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at any one time during the trial.

Allocation concealment and implementation: The allocation sequence will be concealed by the web-based enrolment system. The site research staff will recruit patients and organise an in dependent practitioner to perform FCU (or not). The independent practitioner will receive the allocation and whether to perform FCU or not, and place the completed or blank FCU form in a sealed envelope. The treating doctors will first complete a management plan before opening the envelope to obtain the completed or blank FCU form. The FCU form will then be placed in a second sealed envelope which is not opened until the allocation sequence is revealed. The research staff who will collect outcome data are not involved in patient recruitment and will therefore be blinded to group allocation. The central trial monitor who adjudicates outcomes with the assistance of 2 clinicians are also blinded to allocation.

Statistical methods: The Statistical Consulting Group (University of Melbourne), supervised by team statistician Dr Sandy Clarke,will advise and supervise statistical methods, data management, integrity, security and analysis. The primary outcome will be compared between FCU and control groups using binary logistic regression, with the control group as the reference category. The survival times will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A pre-determined sub-group analysis will separate those with and without an existing TTE in the previous 12 months. Relative risk of death will be analysed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Patterns of management and relative risk (of death) will be compared between groups using a two-sample t-test including sub-group analysis of pathology identified by FCU (e.g., hypovolaemia, cardiac failure and aortic stenosis).

Clinical trial coordination: The trial will be managed through the Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne. This will include all aspects of trial control, data collation, and site co-ordination. An independent committee including a statistician, clinical trial monitor, clinician, and member of the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee will oversee trial safety and data integrity. The committee will perform a planned, blinded interim analysis, after 50% recruitment.

Endpoint adjudication committee An end point committee consisting of a trial monitor and 2 clinicians, blinded to treatment allocation, will be established to adjudicate the non-fatal cardiovascular events at 6 monthly intervals. This committee will also advise on event rate, (blinded) group separation, feasibility and stopping rules.","Inclusion Criteria:

The proposed pilot study is a pilot study which aims to establish feasibility, safety, compliance and group separation prior to commencing a definitive multicentre trial. Aims and Hypotheses Aims 1. To determine whether routine preoperative focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) leads to a reduced composite outcome of death, major adverse cardiac events, and acute renal failure (adverse composite outcome) 30 days after hip fracture surgery compared to patients who do not receive preoperative FCU (current standard of care). 2. To identify the changes in team management of the patient due to FCU that are associated with improved outcome, compared to current standard of care. 3. To determine whether routine preoperative FCU is more cost-effective than current standard of care. Hypotheses 1. FCU reduces adverse composite outcome by at least 20%, 30 days after hip fracture surgery. 2. FCU leads to changes in cardiac diagnosis, and subsequent changes to perioperative and post-discharge management plans, which are associated with improved outcome compared to current standard of care. 3. Routine FCU before hip fracture surgery is more cost-effective than current standard of care. Identifying cardiovascular disease: Preoperative cardiac assessment, which enables improved cardiac treatment and reduction of cardiac complications, is recommended by the American Heart Association. However, cardiovascular disease is often unrecognised and under-diagnosed in this age group because of frailty, general immobility, and the high frequency of poor cognitive function including dementia, which inhibits accurate clinical assessment. Careful cardiac assessment and treatment is often not undertaken because of the belief that surgery should be performed urgently and a delay for cardiac investigations may worsen outcome. Cardiac risk factors for death after hip fracture surgery (cardiac failure, aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy) cannot be reliably diagnosed with clinical examination and require echocardiography (FCU or transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)). Although a pulmonary embolus cannot be reliably diagnosed with echocardiography, the haemodynamic effects from a significant pulmonary embolus are readily seen (right ventricular dilatation and failure). Currently, preoperative TTE is only used in selected patients, based on the clinical assessment and the opinion of the clinician as to whether it is justified. If the anaesthetist reviews the patient just prior to surgery and is concerned about cardiovascular disease, there is a lot of pressure to proceed with booked surgery due to the current belief that early surgery saves lives, rather than to delay surgery for a TTE. Treatment is therefore often based on ""best guess"" clinical assessment. This management approach may lead to inadequate treatment with resultant hypotension, leading to organ failure and death. Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FCU): The conventional TTE investigation is ordered by the treating doctor, performed by a technician and reported by a cardiologist or radiologist at a later time. The TTE provides detailed information on structure and function of all of the valves and chambers and is also referred to as diagnostic echocardiography. A TTE or other complex cardiovascular investigation leads to delay, as the process of obtaining a TTE and then waiting for the report may take days depending on resource availability. Any echocardiography examination is a ""snapshot"" in time, and heart function can change between the performance of the TTE and the commencement of surgery. A FCU utilises the same echocardiography techniques as conventional TTE but is performed as a bedside test by the treating doctor to answer a clinical question to aid clinical decision-making in real time. It provides specific information relevant to perioperative care in time for acute resuscitation and potentially life-saving decision-making. A type of FCU, iHeartScanTM , that is specifically designed for critical and perioperative care has been developed by the Ultrasound Education Group at The University of Melbourne. FCU has been confirmed to be as accurate as comprehensive TTE for purposes of acute clinical care. FCU has been endorsed by The American Society of Echocardiography and embraced by the critical care community. The case for equipoise: The conventional approach to proceed to early surgery without delay for cardiovascular investigations is contrary to the proof-of-concept data that preoperative FCU may reduce mortality through the provision of better cardiovascular diagnostic information, leading to management changes. The use of conventional TTE, however, causes considerable delay to surgery, which may increase mortality risk. FCU has the advantage of providing improved diagnosis without causing substantial delay to surgery, and can therefore is additive to rather than competitive with current ""best practice"". An economic analysis of routine FCU has not been performed. Feasibility of the trial - the ECHONOF II trial In the preliminary study, feasibility of routine FCU in hip fracture surgery was demonstrated, with more than one patient per week at one centre. To determine feasibility of the proposed outcome randomised controlled trial (RCT) a pilot study of feasibility, safety, protocol compliance and group separation will be conducted in 2016 at 4-5 sites across Australia, with the lead site at Royal Melbourne Hospital. The pilot study analysis will include patients recruited who have 30-day data available a in 2016, though data will continue to be collected out to 12 months. The pilot study protocol will be the same as the proposed (future) definitive clinical trial , but the endpoints are aimed at assessing feasibility and compliance. 1. Feasibility outcomes 1. the number of patients screened: recruited ratio \< 4:1 2. recruitment rate of 1 patient/week/centre 2. Safety 1. No harm to patients from performing FCU 2. No surgical delay \> 1 hour by waiting for FCU to be performed 3. Protocol Compliance 1. FCU performed \< 24 hrs. of surgery 2. Treating team notified of FCU result 3. Follow up at all time points (unless death) 4. Incidence of comprehensive TTE in standard group before and after surgery 5. Adverse complications adjudication performed by the adjudication committee 4. Group separation 1. Completion of preoperative and actual perioperative management plans in both groups 2. Analysis for difference in diagnosis and management between groups: aim \> 20% difference between groups Research protocol Trial Design: A parallel group, randomised controlled, multicentre trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants: Patients presenting with isolated, primary, non-metastatic fractured neck of femur, where surgery is expected within 48 hours after hospital admission will be recruited. Patients with prior hip surgery on the affected side, or where the cause is likely to be due to metastatic cancer, or where survival is unlikely in the 24 hours from admission will not be included. Settings and Locations: teaching and regional hospitals in Australia with a high volume of hip fracture surgery and the necessary equipment and expertise to perform FCU have agreed to participate. Intervention: Participants randomised to the FCU group will receive a preoperative FCU performed by an independent operator within 24 hours of planned surgery, following The University of Melbourne iHeartScanTM protocol. Patients randomised to the standard care group will not undergo FCU before surgery. There are no restrictions on the treating team in either group determining what management they will employ, including anaesthesia technique, surgical management, perioperative care and preoperative investigations including comprehensive TTE by the cardiology department. However the treatment of patients will be recorded, allowing comparison of the effect of FCU on diagnosis and management between groups. The control group will represent the standard of care in each of the participating hospitals. This typically includes early surgery with minimal preoperative investigations. Some patients, however, based on the clinical assessment of their treating doctors, will have additional investigations such as comprehensive TTE, which could result in changes in management including an associated delay in surgery. This trial will not interfere with the standard of care management, and, once recruited, patients will remain in the standard of care group even if they receive comprehensive TTE or have delayed surgery. Treatment in both groups will be according to individual and institutional practice, working with the diagnostic information available at the time. Randomisation: Randomisation codes will be in blocks using a web-based automatic enrolment system to participating institutions in order to facilitate recruitment across different time zones and out-of-hours cases. Patients will be stratified to severity of surgery (hip replacement/hemiarthroplasty, or femoral fixation) and institution (tertiary referral, or non-tertiary metropolitan/ regional hospitals). The randomisation sequence will be generated using a computer random sequence generator for each strata in blocks of 10 to ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at any one time during the trial. Allocation concealment and implementation: The allocation sequence will be concealed by the web-based enrolment system. The site research staff will recruit patients and organise an in dependent practitioner to perform FCU (or not). The independent practitioner will receive the allocation and whether to perform FCU or not, and place the completed or blank FCU form in a sealed envelope. The treating doctors will first complete a management plan before opening the envelope to obtain the completed or blank FCU form. The FCU form will then be placed in a second sealed envelope which is not opened until the allocation sequence is revealed. The research staff who will collect outcome data are not involved in patient recruitment and will therefore be blinded to group allocation. The central trial monitor who adjudicates outcomes with the assistance of 2 clinicians are also blinded to allocation. Statistical methods: The Statistical Consulting Group (University of Melbourne), supervised by team statistician Dr Sandy Clarke,will advise and supervise statistical methods, data management, integrity, security and analysis. The primary outcome will be compared between FCU and control groups using binary logistic regression, with the control group as the reference category. The survival times will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A pre-determined sub-group analysis will separate those with and without an existing TTE in the previous 12 months. Relative risk of death will be analysed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Patterns of management and relative risk (of death) will be compared between groups using a two-sample t-test including sub-group analysis of pathology identified by FCU (e.g., hypovolaemia, cardiac failure and aortic stenosis). Clinical trial coordination: The trial will be managed through the Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne. This will include all aspects of trial control, data collation, and site co-ordination. An independent committee including a statistician, clinical trial monitor, clinician, and member of the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee will oversee trial safety and data integrity. The committee will perform a planned, blinded interim analysis, after 50% recruitment. Endpoint adjudication committee An end point committee consisting of a trial monitor and 2 clinicians, blinded to treatment allocation, will be established to adjudicate the non-fatal cardiovascular events at 6 monthly intervals. This committee will also advise on event rate, (blinded) group separation, feasibility and stopping rules.

Unfortunately, the environment of an emergency service often creates conditions for information and education of the patient that are often far from optimal or at least that are specific to a typical consultation.

Data from the international literature showed that 78% of people who come out of emergency after consultation do not clearly understand the instructions and only 20% are aware of their lack of understanding. Waisman et al. Documented that 25% of patients did not understand their diagnosis and that 13% to 18% did not understand treatment instructions. Heng et al.

The involvement of healthcare teams to inform patients with the help of different communication media is therefore particularly important in trying to improve understanding and adherence to exit instructions. However, Zavala et al. Point to the fact that this is not necessarily sufficient.

Some authors have identified factors of poor adherence: multiple chronic diseases, multiple drug treatments, psychiatric disorders, but also age, social isolation, depression, quality of life and socio-economic and cultural level , A low level of health literacy, or planned medical follow-up, the severity of the pathology and the perception of that severity by the patient, or the patient's dissatisfaction with medical instructions.

Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences,OTHER,NCT06820684,Inflammatory Response to OMT,Inflammatory Response to OMT,"Investigators will evaluate inflammation before and after an osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in healthy adults, 18-59 years of age. Investigators will look at proteins in the blood called ""cytokines"". Cytokines can be pro-inflammatory, or anti-inflammatory. Investigators think OMT will reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines. Investigators have selected 4 cytokines (out of a potential 30) that investigators believe, based on the literature, are most likely to change over a brief time period. This project will lay essential groundwork at the investigators' institution for future research where they will study the effects of OMT in persons with diabetes (DM) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). DPN is a common complication of DM and has few treatment options. OMT has never been specifically studied as a treatment for DPN, and if this pilot study shows significant findings, future work in adults with DPN could be useful.

If investigators detect no changes in cytokines, this pilot work is still important. Investigators need to confirm selected tests are sensitive enough to pick up baseline levels of cytokines in healthy people, where there is expected to be low levels of pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1b), and higher levels of anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10). Investigators will also use these data as comparison for future work in people with expectedly higher levels of inflammation due to diabetes with complications (e.g., DPN). If markers measured in this pilot study don't show anything, investigators can look at additional cytokines in future analyses.

University Hospital Ostrava,OTHER,NCT06040684,Development of Antibodies Against Transplant Kidney After Infection,Development of Antibodies Against Transplant Kidney After Infection,"Kidney transplantation is the best method of renal replacement in patients with irreversible renal failure. One of the biggest problems today is premature loss of function of the transplanted kidney. This occurs most often on the basis of chronic humoral rejection. This is the immune response to the kidney, in which the specific antibodies play a crucial role (both against the HLA and the non-HLA system).

The aim of this study is to analyze one of the situations where the production of antibodies can begin to occur. This is a serious acute infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), where it is necessary to significantly reduce doses of immunosuppressives. At the time of reduced immunosuppression, the immune system can recognize the transplanted kidney as foreign to the human body and begin to fight against it.

In this study, the investigators will monitor antibodies against the transplanted kidney in patients with severe acute infection. A serious infection in this study is one that requires acute hospitalization and reduced doses of immunosuppressive drugs. The researchers will measure the antibodies in the blood upon admission and then in 5 weeks.","Kidney transplantation significantly improves the prognosis and quality of life of patients with irreversible renal failure (end-stage kidney disease), requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The length of the function of the transplanted kidney depends on a number of factors. One of the most significant deterioration factors and subsequent graft function failure, in the long run, is the production of antibodies against HLA as well as transplant antigens that lead to acute or chronic humoral rejection. Chronic humoral rejection leading to transplant glomerulopathy is the most common cause of loss of function of the transplanted kidney. Treatment interventions in this area are still ineffective.

In spite of immunosuppressive therapy, some patients develop anti-transplant antibodies (both against HLA and non-HLA antibody molecules) even with stable graft function. However, these patients have an increased risk of losing their function due to chronic humoral rejection. The HLA-DR and HLA-DQ molecules have the greatest immunogenicity.

Patients after kidney transplantation may have many complications. Both surgical (vascular anastomoses stenoses, wound healing problems, graft vascular thromboses, lymphocele, urinary leakage) and non-surgical, some of which are immune-compromised (rejection) and others, result from the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive preparations (infections, cardiovascular effects). Amongst potentially life-threatening conditions include acute infections. Immunosuppressed infections have their own specifics. In addition to the increased risk of infections; also a different spectrum of possible originators is known. It is also possible to encounter opportunistic infections - pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus, polyomavirus infections. Another specific feature is often a different course of infection - patients may not have significantly expressed clinical or laboratory findings and may progress rapidly. For these reasons, physicians are often forced to significantly reduce immunosuppression rates in patients with acute infection, despite the increased risk of developing rejection. This situation increases the risk of initiation by both cell-mediated rejection and antibody-mediated rejection. Signs of rejection are very nonspecific and the only diagnostic method is graft biopsy. Previous studies have shown that the production of antibodies to the transplanted kidney is preceded by clinical signs of deterioration in graft function over weeks to months. Patients included in the study according to the criteria will be examined for the presence of HLA antibodies and non-HLA on admission (within 48 hours of admission) and 5 weeks after the first sample method LUMINEX xMAP.","Inclusion Criteria:

The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of an investigational drug, AZD7325, as a potential treatment for high-functioning adults 18 -35 years old with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The primary study measures are effects on brain waves as measured by non-invasive brain wave recordings (electroencephalograms or EEGs), assessments of side effects, and measures of attention and learning.

The study drug, AZD7325, is manufactured by Astra Zeneca, and was initially tested as a medication for anxiety disorders in over 488 subjects, but was not pursued for marketing due to too few benefits for anxiety. AZD7325 was found to have a very good safety profile and was tolerated by the majority of subjects. AZD7325 has some similar actions to currently marketed anxiety drugs in the benzodiazepine class, but lacks the sedative and negative effects on attention of the benzodiazepines. The study drug is designed to target the GABA neurotransmitter system which is believed to be abnormal in this population.

Most common protocols recommend heparin infusions after surgery with transition to oral aspirin when oral intake begins. Patients at risk for thrombosis after congenital heart surgery requiring long-term antiplatelet therapy include those undergoing shunt placement for single-ventricle palliation or establishment of pulmonary blood flow, valve replacements, or coronary artery manipulation. Post-operative thrombosis after congenital heart surgery is rare, but thrombosis can result in death. The routine use of aspirin in these patients is intended to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences of thrombosis. However, there is no routine clinical assessment of the platelet inhibitory effect of aspirin; nor have there been any prospective studies to assess the effectiveness of aspirin's antiplatelet effect in children after congenital heart surgery. No data exists to suggest that the first dose of aspirin transition from heparin infusion is either sufficient or insufficient in its antiplatelet effect.

In this study, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the first aspirin dose in its antiplatelet effects after surgery for congenital heart disease. Degree of antiplatelet effect will be evaluated with thromboelastograph (TEG) and TEG-platelet mapping study analysis. Thromboelastography is a clinical laboratory method of assessing whole blood hemostasis and allows for assessment of clot formation, strength, and stability. TEG is most commonly used in patients at risk for bleeding or thrombosis and also to monitor antiplatelet therapies (such as aspirin).

The investigators hypothesize: the first dose of aspirin transitioned from heparin infusion after congenital heart surgery is sufficient in its antiplatelet effect as tested by TEG and TEG-platelet mapping studies.

Participants: Eligible participants will meet the Rome III diagnostic criteria for IBS.

Procedures: This study will observe patients treated with Savella® as well as patients treated with a placebo (pill with no active drug). The investigators will monitor and compare several patient and symptom related outcomes, as well as evaluate health related quality of life, psychological distress and related psychosocial measures to determine if the addition of Savella® improves clinical pain response as well as secondary outcomes including quality of life.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized primarily by abdominal pain associated with bowel dysfunction. Like many other painful functional somatic syndromes (e.g. fibromyalgia) the pathophysiology of IBS includes abnormal responses to pain and dysregulation of brain-body pain pathways. IBS affects up to 10% of the population, is a leading reason for visits to gastroenterologists and primary care doctors, and, in the United States, annually accrues health care costs over $20 billion.

In their practice the investigators use centrally acting agents to treat IBS. Historically, the investigators have used tricyclic antidepressants based on results of clinical trials, including our NIH funded trial on desipramine. Nonetheless, these agents can produce side effects that limit their full application. More recently the investigators have begun to use SNRIs because they have been shown to benefit for various pain syndromes like diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia. The initial impression is that Milnacipran helps improve IBS symptoms and global well being. There is now a need to systematically determine Milnacipran's value for IBS.","Inclusion Criteria:

Participants: Eligible participants will meet the Rome III diagnostic criteria for IBS. Procedures: This study will observe patients treated with Savella® as well as patients treated with a placebo (pill with no active drug). The investigators will monitor and compare several patient and symptom related outcomes, as well as evaluate health related quality of life, psychological distress and related psychosocial measures to determine if the addition of Savella® improves clinical pain response as well as secondary outcomes including quality of life. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized primarily by abdominal pain associated with bowel dysfunction. Like many other painful functional somatic syndromes (e.g. fibromyalgia) the pathophysiology of IBS includes abnormal responses to pain and dysregulation of brain-body pain pathways. IBS affects up to 10% of the population, is a leading reason for visits to gastroenterologists and primary care doctors, and, in the United States, annually accrues health care costs over $20 billion. In their practice the investigators use centrally acting agents to treat IBS. Historically, the investigators have used tricyclic antidepressants based on results of clinical trials, including our NIH funded trial on desipramine. Nonetheless, these agents can produce side effects that limit their full application. More recently the investigators have begun to use SNRIs because they have been shown to benefit for various pain syndromes like diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia. The initial impression is that Milnacipran helps improve IBS symptoms and global well being. There is now a need to systematically determine Milnacipran's value for IBS. Inclusion Criteria: * Meet Rome III criteria for IBS and have no red flags. * Must have had a colonoscopy within the previous 5 years to exclude inflammatory or other bowel disease * Be fluent and literate in English * Must either be of non-childbearing potential or agree to utilize approved birth control for the duration of the study Exclusion Criteria: * Diagnosis or treatment of any clinically symptomatic biochemical or structural abnormality of the GI tract within 6 months prior to screening, or active disease within 6 months prior to screening. * Any other diagnosis to explain the abdominal pain, * Clinical evidence of significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, psychiatric or any disease that may interfere with the subject successfully completing the trial * Hepatic dysfunction (ALT \[SGPT\] or AST \[SGOT\] \>3 times the upper limit of normal) or renal impairment (serum creatinine \> 2mg/dL) * Has disease affecting electrolytes balance, such as SIADH with serum Sodium less than 130mmol/L * Any evidence of or treatment of malignancy (other than localized basal cell, squamous cell skin cancer or cancer in situ that has been resected) within the previous year * Any surgery on the stomach, small intestine or colon, excluding appendectomy * A major psychiatric disorder (DSM-III-R or DSM-IV) including major depression or other psychoses that has required hospitalization in the last 1 year. * History of attempted suicide or uncontrolled bipolar disorder. * Currently using antidepressants for psychiatric conditions like major depression.

Stanford University,OTHER,NCT04406584,Intranasal Injection of PRP Versus Saline for Treatment of Olfactory Dysfunction,Intranasal Injection of Platelet-rich Plasma Versus Saline for Treatment of Olfactory Dysfunction,"This randomized clinical trial will evaluate the benefit of platelet-rich plasma (PrP) in the treatment of olfactory dysfunction. PrP can be isolated from a patient's own blood and has been found in previous studies to have anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative properties. It has been used across multiple specialties, such as Orthopedics, Facial Plastics, Dermatology, Neurology in injected form to treat a wide variety of tissues to encourage the body's inherent regenerative capacity. The investigators have completed a pilot study here evaluating it's use in olfactory loss which demonstrated safety and also suggested efficacy. Therefore, the investigators aim to assess the ability of PrP to improve olfactory function in patients with decreased sense of smell.","Olfactory dysfunction constitutes a common impairment in the general population, affecting nearly 20 million in the USA and severely impairing quality of life. Unfortunately, this problem is often permanent, and no effective treatment is available at this time. Although many etiologies exist for olfactory loss, the underlying pathology is thought to be permanent damage to the olfactory bulb, nerves or basal cells of the olfactory system. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous treatment derived from a patient's own blood and has been found to have pro-nerve regenerative properties in animal and human studies. A small pilot study at the principal investigator's institution demonstrated improved olfactory thresholds in patients with partial olfactory loss who received PrP injections. In this randomized clinical trial, the investigators aim to further evaluate the ability of PRP injections to restore olfactory function in human subjects. Given the lack of effective current treatments, a therapeutic benefit of PrP would represent a crucial advancement in research and treatment of olfactory loss, which affects a large swath of the population.

Patients will be seen at the Stanford Sinus center, or at the newly added collaborating institution UCSD, and those with smell loss will be identified by the clinically validated patient directed survey: The UPSIT (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test). They will undergo nasal endoscopy to exclude structural causes of smell loss including mass or tumor. Nasal endoscopy will be performed to exclude structural causes of olfactory, using topical anesthesia (1% phenylephrine \& 4% lidocaine topical spray). THESE ABOVE STEPS CONSTITUTE STANDARD OF CARE FOR EVALUATION OF OLFACTORY LOSS.

The timing of the initial research visit will depend on the evolution of the current covid-19 pandemic and adhere to Stanford guidelines regarding research visits. At the initial research visit, patients meeting inclusion criteria will be evaluated in a procedure room at the Stanford Sinus center. A baseline Sniffin' sticks smell test will be performed (see below). A small vial of blood will be drawn from the patient at the Blake Wilbur first floor laboratory. The research coordinator will walk the patient back to clinic along with the patient's blood smple. PRP will be isolated from the blood by the study investigator, following manufacturer instructions from the PurePRP preparation kit (Emcyte corporation), which will involve use of a centrifuge located in the clinic for this purpose. 0.5 mL of the PRP solution will be set aside for platelet quantification. From the remaining PRP solution, patients will then receive 1ml of autologous PrP or sterile saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride), which will be injected into the superior septum mucosa near the olfactory groove bilaterally. Patients will be blindfolded during injection to prevent identification of the injected specimen, and will previously be randomized in a 1:1 ratio via a random number generator. Patients will be monitored for side effects for 15 minutes. (We routinely perform nasal endoscopy with injection and associated procedures in our clinic, which patients tolerate very well.) Injections will then be performed twice more at 2-weeks and 4-weeks after the initial injection, for a total of 3 biweekly injections. ALL OF THE ABOVE STEPS ARE FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

The Sniffin' Sticks test is a validated, non-invasive assessment of olfactory function via presentation of scented felt pens to blindfolded patients. The output is the TDI score (threshold, discrimination, identification). The TDI score will be recorded at baseline (initial research visit), and then at 1-month and 3-months after the initial test, for a total of 3 tests. The first test will occur before the first injection, and the second test will be performed before the third injection. There will be no injection at the last (third) test. THE ABOVE VISITS ARE FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

Kristian Kjær Petersen,OTHER,NCT04224584,A Mechanism Based Proof of Concept Study of the Effects of Duloxetine in the Treatment of Patients With Osteoarthritic Knee Pain,A Mechanism Based Proof of Concept Study of the Effects of Duloxetine in the Treatment of Patients With Osteoarthritic Knee Pain,"Background: Duloxetine provides an analgesic effect of patients with OA. The mode of action of duloxetine is partly believed to act through modulating the descending inhibitory pain pathways from the brainstem towards the spinal cord thereby dampening pain by gating the afferent pain signals from the periphery during their passage to the brain. This study aims to investigate if the analgesic effect of duloxetine is due to modulation of pain mechanisms.

Study Rationale: The present study will utilize a set of quantitative pain biomarkers developed to assess peripheral and central manifestations in OA and the influence of duloxetine on those manifestations.

Treatment: Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences:

1. Sequence 1: 20 mg duloxetine QD for 1 week, 40 mg Duloxetine QD for 1 week, 60 mg duloxetine QD for 10 weeks, 40 mg duloxetine QD for 1 week, 20 mg duloxetine QD for 1 week, followed by 14 weeks of corresponding placebo
2. Sequence 2: 14 weeks of placebo followed by 20 mg Duloxetine QD for 1 week, 40 mg duloxetine QD for 1 week, 60 mg duloxetine QD for 10 weeks, 40 mg duloxetine QD for 1 week and 20 mg duloxetine QD for 1 week.

The two treatment periods of 14 weeks each are separated by a washout period of two weeks and include a two-week titration period.

Primary Objective: To assess the effect of 60 mg daily maintenance dose administration of Duloxetine for 10 weeks compared with placebo on pain mechanisms.

Sample Size Justification/Statistics: The sample size was calculated to 32 patients providing a power of 85% with a significant level of 0.05 to detect a group difference of 1 point in the change from baseline of the week 12 mean of 24-hour worst pain between duloxetine and placebo treatment.

Patient Selection: Up to 40 patients with osteoarthritic knee pain will be enrolled in this study in order to complete 32 patients.

The primary purpose is to assess the different situations in maintaining treatment programme in SpA patients with controlled inflammation by Yisaipu®. And the second purpose is to assess the eficacy and safety of Yisaipu® in axial SpAs. The trial will include 150 patients with stable NSAIDs therapy, and at the first stage they will receive 24-week full-dose of Yisaipu®. Then at the second stage the patients who achieve low disease activity (LDA, ASDAS\<2.1) at 24th week will be randomizedly divided into three group: full-dose of Yisaipu® group, half-dose of Yisaipu® group and placebo group. And the blind stage will last for 48 weeks. Patients who complete the 72-week therapy or achieve disease-flare criteria during the blind stage would finish the study.","This randomised controlled trial enrolled adult patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis at 3 centres in China. Patients had to fulfil ASAS axial spondyloarthritis criteria but could not fulfil the modified New York radiologic criterion for ankylosing spondylitis,and had to have objective evidence of active inflammation or chronic structral change，such as bone erosion or fat metaplasia in the sacroiliac joints on MRI at screening. Active disease activity was defined as a disease activity score in ASDAS-CRP ≥2.1,or Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index \[BASDAI\] ≥4 on a numerical rating scale of 0-10, and an inadequate response to more than one non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 4 weeks at least, intolerance to NSAIDs, or contraindication for NSAIDs. No change in NSAIDs dose was required from 2 weeks before screening to the end of the study. Dose stability or discontinuation was required for 4 weeks before baseline for concomitant DMARDs or corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent at a dose of less than 10 mg/day). Chinese herbal medicine, physical therapy, or live (attenuated) vaccine, or intravenous immunoglobulin IgG, was required for discontinuation and wash period for at least 4 weeks. Patients were excluded if they had previously taken or were taking biologic treatment, any biologic Dmards such as IL-6 or CD-20 inhibitors. Patients with latent tuberculosis infection were included only when local guidelines were followed for prophylactic treatment and if treatment was initiated before Yisaipu.

All patients provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each study site. The study was conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and the Declaration of Helsinki.

A randomized envelope was used to enrol all patients at the baseline visit and to randomly assign qualifying patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either blinded Yisaipu 50 mg subcutaneously every week or 25 mg subcutaneously every week or matching placebo at week 24. All study personnel, including the sponsor (with the exception of the Sanshengguojian drug supply management team), investigator, and study site personnel, and the patient remained blinded to treatment throughout the double-blinded period from week 24 through week 72 of the study. Investigational products were provided to maintain blinding.

In the initial open-label period, enrolled patients were given subcutaneous injections of 50 mg Yisaipu every week for 36 weeks. Participants were given the dose of NSAIDs they had been receiving at screening; a dose decrease or discontinuation was allowed when the patients were intolerance to NSAIDs, or contraindication for NSAIDs. Patients who achieved clinical remission, defined as achieving ASDAS inactive or moderate disease (ASDAS score \<2.1) at weeks 24, were randomly assigned to receive either blinded 50mg Yisaipu (continuation arm), 25mg Yisaipu(reduction arm) or matching placebo (withdrawal arm) for 48 weeks during the double-blind period, for a total of 72 weeks of treatment.

During the double-blind period, patients who experienced a flare (defined as an increase in BASDAI ≥2 points compare to the BASDAI score when randomization) were allocate to termination of this trial.","Inclusion Criteria:

The primary purpose is to assess the different situations in maintaining treatment programme in SpA patients with controlled inflammation by Yisaipu®. And the second purpose is to assess the eficacy and safety of Yisaipu® in axial SpAs. The trial will include 150 patients with stable NSAIDs therapy, and at the first stage they will receive 24-week full-dose of Yisaipu®. Then at the second stage the patients who achieve low disease activity (LDA, ASDAS\<2.1) at 24th week will be randomizedly divided into three group: full-dose of Yisaipu® group, half-dose of Yisaipu® group and placebo group. And the blind stage will last for 48 weeks. Patients who complete the 72-week therapy or achieve disease-flare criteria during the blind stage would finish the study. This randomised controlled trial enrolled adult patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis at 3 centres in China. Patients had to fulfil ASAS axial spondyloarthritis criteria but could not fulfil the modified New York radiologic criterion for ankylosing spondylitis,and had to have objective evidence of active inflammation or chronic structral change，such as bone erosion or fat metaplasia in the sacroiliac joints on MRI at screening. Active disease activity was defined as a disease activity score in ASDAS-CRP ≥2.1,or Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index \[BASDAI\] ≥4 on a numerical rating scale of 0-10, and an inadequate response to more than one non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 4 weeks at least, intolerance to NSAIDs, or contraindication for NSAIDs. No change in NSAIDs dose was required from 2 weeks before screening to the end of the study. Dose stability or discontinuation was required for 4 weeks before baseline for concomitant DMARDs or corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent at a dose of less than 10 mg/day). Chinese herbal medicine, physical therapy, or live (attenuated) vaccine, or intravenous immunoglobulin IgG, was required for discontinuation and wash period for at least 4 weeks. Patients were excluded if they had previously taken or were taking biologic treatment, any biologic Dmards such as IL-6 or CD-20 inhibitors. Patients with latent tuberculosis infection were included only when local guidelines were followed for prophylactic treatment and if treatment was initiated before Yisaipu. All patients provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each study site. The study was conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and the Declaration of Helsinki. A randomized envelope was used to enrol all patients at the baseline visit and to randomly assign qualifying patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either blinded Yisaipu 50 mg subcutaneously every week or 25 mg subcutaneously every week or matching placebo at week 24. All study personnel, including the sponsor (with the exception of the Sanshengguojian drug supply management team), investigator, and study site personnel, and the patient remained blinded to treatment throughout the double-blinded period from week 24 through week 72 of the study. Investigational products were provided to maintain blinding. In the initial open-label period, enrolled patients were given subcutaneous injections of 50 mg Yisaipu every week for 36 weeks. Participants were given the dose of NSAIDs they had been receiving at screening; a dose decrease or discontinuation was allowed when the patients were intolerance to NSAIDs, or contraindication for NSAIDs. Patients who achieved clinical remission, defined as achieving ASDAS inactive or moderate disease (ASDAS score \<2.1) at weeks 24, were randomly assigned to receive either blinded 50mg Yisaipu (continuation arm), 25mg Yisaipu(reduction arm) or matching placebo (withdrawal arm) for 48 weeks during the double-blind period, for a total of 72 weeks of treatment. During the double-blind period, patients who experienced a flare (defined as an increase in BASDAI ≥2 points compare to the BASDAI score when randomization) were allocate to termination of this trial.

Baylor College of Medicine,OTHER,NCT04952584,Allogeneic CD30 Chimeric Antigen Receptor Epstein-Barr Virus-Specific T Lymphocytes in Relapsed or Refractory CD30-Positive Lymphomas,A Phase 1 Study Evaluating the Safety and Activity of Allogeneic CD30 Chimeric Antigen Receptor Epstein-Barr Virus-Specific T Lymphocytes (CD30.CAR-EBVSTs) in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD30-Positive Lymphomas,"This study involved patients that have a cancer called diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), NK and T cell lymphomas (NK/TL) or classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) (hereafter these 3 diseases will be referred to as lymphoma). Patients lymphoma has come back or not gone away after treatment. Because there is no standard treatment for the patients cancer at this time or because the currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, the patients are being asked to volunteer in this research study.

In this study the investigators want to test a type of T cell made from a normal donor. The T cells the investigators will use are called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) specific T cells (EBVSTs) and are cells that the investigators have trained in the laboratory to recognize a EBV which is the virus that causes mono or kissing disease. Some patients with lymphoma have EBV in their cancer cells. Researchers have given T cell lines from normal donor EBVSTs to lymphoma patients who have EBV in their lymphoma cells and have seen responses in about half the patients. The cells have have been generated and are frozen in a bank. The cells are called ""allogeneic"" (meaning the donor is not related to the patient). CD30.CAR in EBV-specific T cells (called allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST) from the blood of healthy donors. The investigators are giving the cells to patients with lymphoma cells that express CD30. If the lymphoma cells also express EBV there may be some benefit from targeting both proteins.

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest safe dose of allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST cells given following chemotherapy and used to treat lymphoma. The investigators will learn the side effects of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in patients and see whether this therapy may help lymphoma patients.","Earlier, healthy donors gave blood for us to make CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in the laboratory. These cells were grown and frozen and the investigators will select the donor which the investigators think is the best match for the patient. This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Once the lower dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the T cell infusion will be stopped. Both the risks and benefits of this study may be dose related. The investigators don't know the best dose that will provide benefit while minimizing the risks.

To enroll on this study, patients will need to have recovered from toxic effects of previous chemotherapy and not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients cannot have received any tumor vaccines within the previous six weeks.

If patients agree to take part in this study, the investigators will ask the patients to adhere to the following study visits and procedure. After patients have signed the consent form, patients are required to come to the hospital for a series of standard medical screening tests, lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, infusion with CD30.CAR-EBVST cell treatment and follow-up visits (See details below).

1. Screening tests

   Screening tests include:
   * Blood tests \[Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) testing\] to help us identify the best match for the patient from the banked CD30.CAR-EBVST cells.
   * Blood tests for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus \[HIV\], human T cell lymphotropic virus \[HTLV\], hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus.
   * Tumor biopsy test to check the status of CD30.

   Once the investigators find that patients are eligible for this study, patients will be called for additional screening tests before treatment day. The screening tests include:
   * Physical examination
   * Vital signs tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure
   * Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions
   * Urine test
   * Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential
   * Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies
2. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in the blood stream. Because of that, if patients have NOT had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant recently, patients will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy drugs) before patients receive the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells if patients doctor thinks this is appropriate. This is called ""lymphodepletion"". These drugs will decrease the numbers of patients own T cells before the investigators inject the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Although the investigators do not expect any effect on the patients tumor with the dose that the patients will receive, these drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat lymphoma.
3. Treatment with CD30.CAR-EBVST cells Patients will be given one injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. The CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will be injected into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. Before patients receive the injection, patients may be given a dose of acetaminophen or anti-histamine (Benadryl for example) to minimize any possible allergic reaction. The injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will take within 10 minutes. The investigators will follow patients in the clinic after each injection for up to 3 hours. The patient will need to stay less than 2 hours away from the Medical Center for 4 weeks after the CD30.CAR-EBVST cell infusion so the investigator can monitor them for side effects.

   At the discretion of the study doctor, if patients have stable disease (the lymphoma did not grow) or there is a reduction in the size of the patients lymphoma on imaging studies at week 6 after T-cell infusion or on subsequent evaluations, then patients may receive up to two additional doses of the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells at approximately 6 weeks intervals if patients wish to. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy may also be administered before additional doses of CD30.CAR-EBVST infusion. After each T-cell infusion, patients will be monitored to ensure that participants don't have a reaction to the infusion.
4. Follow-up visits

On follow-up visits after treatment, patients will also receive a series of standard medical tests:

* Physical examination
* Vital sign tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure
* Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions
* Urine tests (if clinically necessary)
* Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (if clinically necessary)
* Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies

After infusion of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells,the patients blood will be collected on follow-up visits at week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 8, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 more years. Blood samples and tumor biopsies will also be periodically collected, based on the patients doctor's discretion for exploratory tests in the laboratory. After 5 years, in the event there is suspected or new cancer is detected, additional blood sample will also be collected for additional tests.

To learn more about the way the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells are working and how long they last in the body, the investigators will draw blood. The total amount of blood collected on any day is about 4-18 teaspoons (18-87 ml). This volume is considered safe but may be decreased if the patients are anemic. Patients blood will be drawn from a central line if participants have one. The total blood drawn during the patients participation in this study will not exceed 110 teaspoons (546 ml).

The investigators will also look at any scans or biopsies patients have had as standard of care.","Inclusion Criteria:

The T cells the investigators will use are called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) specific T cells (EBVSTs) and are cells that the investigators have trained in the laboratory to recognize a EBV which is the virus that causes mono or kissing disease. Some patients with lymphoma have EBV in their cancer cells. Researchers have given T cell lines from normal donor EBVSTs to lymphoma patients who have EBV in their lymphoma cells and have seen responses in about half the patients. The cells have have been generated and are frozen in a bank. The cells are called ""allogeneic"" (meaning the donor is not related to the patient). CD30.CAR in EBV-specific T cells (called allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST) from the blood of healthy donors. The investigators are giving the cells to patients with lymphoma cells that express CD30. If the lymphoma cells also express EBV there may be some benefit from targeting both proteins. The purpose of this study is to find out the highest safe dose of allogeneic CD30.CAR-EBVST cells given following chemotherapy and used to treat lymphoma. The investigators will learn the side effects of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in patients and see whether this therapy may help lymphoma patients. Earlier, healthy donors gave blood for us to make CD30.CAR-EBVST cells in the laboratory. These cells were grown and frozen and the investigators will select the donor which the investigators think is the best match for the patient. This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Once the lower dose schedule proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered or the T cell infusion will be stopped. Both the risks and benefits of this study may be dose related. The investigators don't know the best dose that will provide benefit while minimizing the risks. To enroll on this study, patients will need to have recovered from toxic effects of previous chemotherapy and not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients cannot have received any tumor vaccines within the previous six weeks. If patients agree to take part in this study, the investigators will ask the patients to adhere to the following study visits and procedure. After patients have signed the consent form, patients are required to come to the hospital for a series of standard medical screening tests, lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, infusion with CD30.CAR-EBVST cell treatment and follow-up visits (See details below). 1. Screening tests Screening tests include: * Blood tests \[Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) testing\] to help us identify the best match for the patient from the banked CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. * Blood tests for viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus \[HIV\], human T cell lymphotropic virus \[HTLV\], hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. * Tumor biopsy test to check the status of CD30. Once the investigators find that patients are eligible for this study, patients will be called for additional screening tests before treatment day. The screening tests include: * Physical examination * Vital signs tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure * Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions * Urine test * Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential * Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies 2. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in the blood stream. Because of that, if patients have NOT had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant recently, patients will receive treatment with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy drugs) before patients receive the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells if patients doctor thinks this is appropriate. This is called ""lymphodepletion"". These drugs will decrease the numbers of patients own T cells before the investigators inject the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. Although the investigators do not expect any effect on the patients tumor with the dose that the patients will receive, these drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat lymphoma. 3. Treatment with CD30.CAR-EBVST cells Patients will be given one injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells. The CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will be injected into the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. Before patients receive the injection, patients may be given a dose of acetaminophen or anti-histamine (Benadryl for example) to minimize any possible allergic reaction. The injection of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells will take within 10 minutes. The investigators will follow patients in the clinic after each injection for up to 3 hours. The patient will need to stay less than 2 hours away from the Medical Center for 4 weeks after the CD30.CAR-EBVST cell infusion so the investigator can monitor them for side effects. At the discretion of the study doctor, if patients have stable disease (the lymphoma did not grow) or there is a reduction in the size of the patients lymphoma on imaging studies at week 6 after T-cell infusion or on subsequent evaluations, then patients may receive up to two additional doses of the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells at approximately 6 weeks intervals if patients wish to. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy may also be administered before additional doses of CD30.CAR-EBVST infusion. After each T-cell infusion, patients will be monitored to ensure that participants don't have a reaction to the infusion. 4. Follow-up visits On follow-up visits after treatment, patients will also receive a series of standard medical tests: * Physical examination * Vital sign tests to measure temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure * Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver functions * Urine tests (if clinically necessary) * Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (if clinically necessary) * Measurements of tumor by routine imaging studies After infusion of CD30.CAR-EBVST cells,the patients blood will be collected on follow-up visits at week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, week 8, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 more years. Blood samples and tumor biopsies will also be periodically collected, based on the patients doctor's discretion for exploratory tests in the laboratory. After 5 years, in the event there is suspected or new cancer is detected, additional blood sample will also be collected for additional tests. To learn more about the way the CD30.CAR-EBVST cells are working and how long they last in the body, the investigators will draw blood. The total amount of blood collected on any day is about 4-18 teaspoons (18-87 ml). This volume is considered safe but may be decreased if the patients are anemic. Patients blood will be drawn from a central line if participants have one. The total blood drawn during the patients participation in this study will not exceed 110 teaspoons (546 ml). The investigators will also look at any scans or biopsies patients have had as standard of care. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Diagnosis and clinical course falling into one of the following categories: 1.

Far Eastern Memorial Hospital,OTHER,NCT04458779,Continuous Positive Airway Pressure on Acute Stroke and Obstructive Sleep Apnea,Cardiovascular Effects of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Patients With Acute Stroke and Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Stroke affects 16.9 million individuals each year and is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacologic therapy, morbidity , mortality and rates of hospitalization for stroke remain high. These data emphasize the importance of identifying all treatable conditions that could aggravate stroke. One such condition is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The aim in this cross-sectional study investigators will document the differences in the body composition, nutritional intake and general health status of healthy adults aged 18 to 80 years who are on plant-based diet of 0.5-10 years and to determine if their body composition status is associated to the duration of eating with PBD between the 3 groups: those that are 0.5-2 years (short-term), 2-5 years (medium-term) and 5-10 years (long-term) on PBD.

This study will also include the monitoring of other factors of healthy and active lifestyle of PBD participants, namely the status of habitual and organized physical activity, the status of daily long-term seating, the status of stress and hygiene of sleep, socio-economic status and the motive(s)/reasons for starting PBD. Investigators will also record their maximum (lifetime) body weight, body weight upon entering the PBD lifestyle, and using data from participants, blood analysis to collect their basic biochemistry results, and data on current blood pressure status.

The investigators hypothesis is that:

(H1): There are no differences in nutritional status between people who are short- (0.5-2 years), the medium- (2-5 years) or the long-term (5-10 years) on PBD.

(H2): At least 80% of the tested subjects have plasma lipid values and blood pressure within the reference values.

The methods to be used are a medically approved bioimpedance body composition monitor (Tanita, 780 S MA, Tokyo, Japan), medically approved body weight scale and body height gauge (MPE 250K100HM), a 3-day dietary record (3-DR), one adopted by NIH: socio-demographic, economic status and motive for PBD questionnaire, and three standardized questionnaires: (1) habitual and organized physical activity, and the frequency of sitting (IPAQ-long), (2) stress (PSQ-30), and (3) quality of sleep (PSQI).

Concerning 3-DR, the study participants will weight and record all foods, beverages consumed, as well as leftovers, and dietary supplements over three consecutive days (two weekdays and one weekend) using electronic kitchen scales. The study participants will choose the day of the beginning of dietary recording within a given period (i. e.: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or Thursday, Friday, Saturday). When exact weighing will not be possible (e.g., in case of eating out), household measures (spoon, cup, glass, etc.) and a picture book with household measures in adults' portion sizes (photos of reference foods with their actual gram weight) (NIJZ, 2016), allowed semi-quantitative recording. For the evaluation of dietary intake, investigators will use dietary software, Open Platform for Clinical Nutrition (OPEN), which is a web-based application (http://opkp.si/) and has been developed by the Jozef Stefan Institute and supported by the EuroFIR AISBL (http://eurofir.org) and the European Federation of the Association of Dietitians (EFAD).

The energy and nutrient contents of commercial food or home prepared foods, will estimated by recipe simulation using labelled ingredients and nutrient contents. OPEN will be continuously updated by adding those products or recopies recorded by study participants on PBD.

In order to assess the nutritional intake from dietary supplements, we will use Res-Pons d.o.o. services, which professionally manages the database with all dietary supplements products on the Slovenian market (Pretehtajte.si, 2018).

Vanderbilt University,OTHER,NCT02159079,A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Conservative Fluid Balance Strategy for Patients With Sepsis and Cardiopulmonary Dysfunction (BALANCE Study),A Phase II/III Randomized Controlled Trial of a Conservative Fluid Balance Strategy for Patients With Sepsis and Cardiopulmonary Dysfunction,"Sepsis is a common inflammatory response to infection characterized by hypovolemia and vasodilation for which early administration of intravenous fluids has been suggested to improve outcomes. The ideal fluid balance following initial resuscitation is unclear. Septic patients treated in the intensive care unit commonly receive significant volumes of intravenous fluids with resultant positive fluid balance for up to a week after their initial resuscitation. Observational studies have associated fluid receipt and positive fluid balance in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock with increased mortality but are inherently limited by indication bias. In order to determine the optimal approach to fluid management following resuscitation in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, a randomized controlled trial is needed. The primary hypothesis of this study is that, compared to usual care, a conservative approach to fluid management after resuscitation in patients with sepsis and cardiopulmonary dysfunction will increase intensive care unit free days.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

The ideal fluid balance following initial resuscitation is unclear. Septic patients treated in the intensive care unit commonly receive significant volumes of intravenous fluids with resultant positive fluid balance for up to a week after their initial resuscitation. Observational studies have associated fluid receipt and positive fluid balance in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock with increased mortality but are inherently limited by indication bias. In order to determine the optimal approach to fluid management following resuscitation in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, a randomized controlled trial is needed. The primary hypothesis of this study is that, compared to usual care, a conservative approach to fluid management after resuscitation in patients with sepsis and cardiopulmonary dysfunction will increase intensive care unit free days.

This trial aims to study the effect of the probiotic Nyaditum resae® at the level of specific Treg memory cells eight weeks after the first administration, and the global tolerability of the treatment.

Nyaditum resae® is a preparation in the form of capsules containing heat-killed environmental mycobacteria Mycobacterium manresensis. The overall objective of the study is the effect of Nyaditum resae® on immunity, which could reduce the risk of developing active tuberculosis.","The incidence of tuberculosis is still a problem of the first magnitude. Every year 1.5 million people die; there are 10 million cases of illness and 100 million new infected. The growing problem of multi-resistance is to be added, remaining so prevalent: 700,000 patients, a figure that increases annually with 100,000 people. Prevention of tuberculosis is currently very difficult because it is a disease caused by a bacillus (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that is transmitted by air: No risk factor for becoming infected has been identified and there is still no prophylactic vaccine that prevents from infection. One of the most characteristic aspects of tuberculosis is that the majority (90-95 %) of people without immunity alterations do not develop the disease after being infected. As for people who do develop the disease, it is still not known why they develop it.

A group of researchers from the Institut Germans Trias i Pujol recently discovered a mechanism that explains this trend. In short, what happens is that certain people create a too strong inflammatory response against tuberculosis bacillus, which ends up creating massive destruction of the tissue that is around the bacillus and brings the characteristic lesion of tuberculosis: tuberculous cavity.

This group of researchers was devising ways to ""reeducate"" the immune system against the bacillus not make it aggressive. And they did it using two instruments. The first one, an environmental mycobacteria, namely a bacillus of the family of mycobacteria tuberculosis, that usually lives in the water we drink, so that at a greater or lesser extent we already have it in our intestinal flora. The second, inducing a tolerant response, like we do when we eat food. To induce a tolerant response, low and repeated doses of the product make the immune system of the digestive duct ""used to"" their presence. Thus, when it becomes to find the product, the immune system reacts in a very light and balanced manner, avoiding excessive inflammatory responses. The clearest example is the fact that our immune system ""is used"" to feed proteins and generates no rejection answers found in the intestinal mucosa.

Hence comes the probiotic Nyaditum resae®, a preparation in the form of capsules, containing a heat-killed Mycobacterium manresensis and thus can generate a cross-immunity with the tuberculosis bacillus. By giving low and repeated dose to generate a tolerant response, which happens when there is an infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, so that a balanced immune response is triggered able to reduce the risk of developing active tuberculosis.

Tolerability of Nyaditum resae® has been studied in adults. Next step is to asses its behavior in pediatric population, since is a particularly vulnerable population in countries where there is a high incidence of this disease.","Inclusion Criteria:

People with hereditary gastric cancer syndrome are at increased risk of getting cancer in their stomach. These people should have regular endoscopies and biopsies to check for cancer if they are choosing to keep their stomach. Researchers want to see if they can improve the detection of cancer by endoscopy. Improved endoscopies could better detect early signs of cancer in people with this syndrome.

Objective:

To see if a small microscope attached to an endoscope to inspect the stomach lining is better than regular endoscopy to find the first signs of cancer in the stomach.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older who have a personal or family history of a hereditary gastric cancer syndrome or have a mutation that is known to lead to gastric cancer

Design:

Participants will be screened over the phone or in person with:

* Personal and family medical history
* Review of their medical records

Participants will have a physical exam. Then they will be put under general anesthesia. They will have an endoscopy. A lighted tube will be inserted into the mouth and go down to the stomach. First, the standard device will be used. Then participants will be injected with fluorescein. This is a contrast agent. Then the microscope will be added to the tube and the endoscopic evaluation of the stomach will be repeated. During the procedure, biopsies will be taken from different areas of the stomach. Participants will be observed for a few hours after the procedure.

About 14 days after the endoscopy, participants will be asked to return to the clinic for a follow-up visit. This visit can also be conducted over the phone.","Background:

Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) syndrome is caused by a germline mutation in the Cadherin 1 (CDH1) gene. Carriers of this mutation have a 56-70% lifetime risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma. Current international guidelines recommend endoscopic screening of CDH1 mutation carriers that consists of systematic biopsies of an otherwise normal appearing stomach. However, this approach lacks sufficient sensitivity for detecting intramucosal foci of signet ring cells (SRC), which are pathognomonic of HDGC syndrome. The goal of the current study is to utilize confocal endoscopic microscopy (CEM) for screening the gastric mucosa in this high-risk population.

Objective:

Determine if confocal endoscopic microscopy (CEM) will afford greater sensitivity for detection of signet ring cells (SRC) foci in CDH1 germline mutation carriers.

Eligibility:

CDH1 germline mutation carriers, or those who meet clinical criteria for HDGC testing but have tested negative for a CDH1 gene mutation or those who have other germline mutations suspected to be, or reported to be, associated with HDGC (e.g. Catenin Alpha 1 (CTNNA1).

University of Manitoba,OTHER,NCT02100384,Long Term Comparison of Ultrasonic and Hand Instrumentation in the Maintenance of Peri-implant Tissues: A Randomized Clinical Trial,Long Term Comparison of Ultrasonic and Hand Instrumentation in the Maintenance of Peri-implant Tissues: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Nowadays, dental implants are a very attractive and affordable treatment option for patients. According to the American Society of Implant Dentistry the dental implant market in the U.S is projected to reach $1.3 billion by 20101. Despite the high success rates of dental implants, it is clear that osseointegrated implants are susceptible to diseases. The prevalence of dental implant complications are rising as the number of individuals that are receiving implant treatment is also increasing. One of these peri-implant complications is an inflammatory condition known as peri-implant mucositis that occurs in 64.6% to 80% of the implant population.

The lack of preventive maintenance therapy in subjects with peri-implant mucositis is associated with a high incidence of peri-implantitis, which eventually may lead to implant loss. One important method in the prevention of peri-implant mucositis is the reduction in plaque accumulation, through individual oral hygiene procedures and regular peri-implant professional maintenance. It is highly important that patients be educated about the importance of developing good oral hygiene habits and to attend regular periodontal maintenance appointments. The clinicians have to recognize the significance of monitoring and maintaining peri-implant health.

Unfortunately, it is unclear which of the different maintenance regimens and treatments strategies for peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis are more effective. There is lack of information about which peri-implant maintenance protocol offers the best outcome in terms of reduction of inflammation and improved patient comfort. According to Grusovin et al, ""there is only low quality evidence for which are the most effective interventions for maintaining or recovering health of peri-implant soft tissues and there is no reliable evidence as to which regimens are most effective for long term maintenance"". Moreover, current approaches to implant maintenance are somewhat haphazard and not standardized.

It is assumed that what is appropriate for teeth is also beneficial for implants; as stated by Persson et al, 2010 ""therapies proposed for the management of peri-implant diseases are currently based on the evidence available from the treatment of periodontitis"". Two conventionally used methods of biofilm and calculus removal from teeth in North America are hand instruments (curettes and scalers) and ultrasonics. In teeth these two modalities of treatment have been studied extensively; conversely, there are fewer studies on dental implants. Renvert et al, 2008 concluded that mechanical non-surgical treatment might be effective to treat peri-implant mucositis but not peri-implantitis; however, the data supporting this literature review was scarce. The same research group compared ultrasonic instrumentation with specific-implant tips to titanium curettes in the treatment of peri-implantitis founding no group differences in the treatment outcomes with improvements in plaque and bleeding scores but no effects on probing depths. In addition, both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts and no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in a six months period.

One of the main concerns for dental implants is that metal scalers and ultrasonics generate a roughened surface on the implant, which in turn facilitates plaque accumulation and therefore makes maintenance of plaque free surfaces more difficult. It was observed in a recent study that special coated scalers and ultrasonic tips have been shown in vitro to be compatible with implant surfaces, however this has not been confirmed in vivo. The previous finding is in agreement with a current study, which demonstrated that the roughness values of the titanium surface of implants treated with piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers with a newly developed metallic tip and plastic hand curettes, are equal to the surface's roughness of untreated implants. Mann et al, 2012 showed in an in vitro study that plastic-coated scalers cause minimal damage to the implant surface but leave plastic deposits behind on the implant surface, suggesting further research is needed to evaluate the use of such plastic tips in the debridement of implants.

An additional factor, in evaluating the efficacy of different instrumentation in peri-implant maintenance, which needs to be taken into consideration, is patient perception. There is currently no data evaluating patient perception of comfort in regards to hand vs. ultrasonic instrumentation. This information is very important because should both methods of debridement be considered of equal efficacy, patient preference may play a role in the practitioner's selection of instrumentation. Knowing that patient comfort will increase the patient's compliance to the maintenance therapy, further evaluation of this factor is necessary.","Long term comparison of ultrasonic and hand instrumentation in the maintenance of peri-implant tissues: A randomized clinical trial

Objective

The aim of this study is to determine the clinical effects, presence of inflammatory cytokines, and the patients' perceived discomfort by comparing titanium scalers to ultrasonic instrumentation using implant inserts in a patient population with healthy peri-implant tissues and implants with peri-implant mucositis during a one-year period of peri-implant maintenance.

Hypothesis

There are insufficient studies in the literature to guide the clinician which technique will offer better results in maintaining health or in decreasing inflammation long term around dental implants during peri-implant maintenance. It is postulated in this study that (1) peri-implant therapy will have a beneficial clinical effect, will decrease the presence of inflammatory cytokines and will be well tolerated by the patient population and that (2) there will be no differences in the outcomes between the two peri-implant maintenance therapies.

The Oral Biology Laboratory of the University of Manitoba will perform the analysis of samples of the peri-implant crevicular fluid. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, CONSORT Statement will be followed.

66 participants with at least one single dental implant will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the two peri-implant maintenance groups. Subjects enrolled in the study will be regular patients of the Periodontics Graduated Clinic at the University of Manitoba, Faculty of Dentistry. Each participant will sign a written informed consent. The randomization will be computer-generated by a second person not involved in the study.

A total of 352 sites (6sites/implant) will be studied. Cohen effect size has been used to calculate the sample size. Small to medium effect size ranges by Cohen: 0.2mm to 0.5mm. In addition, independent t-test with alpha=0.05, power (1-beta) =80%, 95% confidence interval and two tailed test. Allocation ratio, n1/n2=1. G\*Power 3.1.7 software was used in sample size calculation. An attrition rate of 6 participants was calculated.

A code will be assigned to each participant. Only the research coordinator will have access to the patients/codes matching list and its corresponding therapy. The peri-implant maintenance will be performed by two experienced Dental Hygienists previous intra and inter-examiner calibration. A single blinded calibrated examiner (MC) will do the recording of clinical findings and sampling at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.

The following are the inclusion criteria: (1) subjects having at least one single unit dental implant (2) probing depths no more than 5mm in 6 aspects around each implant (MB, B, DB, ML, L and DL), (3) no bone loss beyond 2mm/implant at baseline confirmed with periapical radiographs with a cone paralleling technique. The next criteria will be excluded from the study: (1) implant supported removable prostheses, (2) use of antibiotics within the preceding 3 months (3) smokers (4) missing exam at baseline.

The parameters to be assessed at 6 sites/implant are the following: (1) Modified plaque index by Mombelli (2) Modified gingival index by Mombelli, (3) probing depths (PD), (4) presence of keratinized gingiva (0, 0.5-1.5mm, 2 or greater), (5) recession (REC) distance between gingival margin and most occlusal point of restoration, (6) Cytokine levels in peri-implant crevicular fluid, 1 sample from the deepest site of implant(s) will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. In addition, patients will also be asked to fill in a pain questionnaire at the end of the study period (Visual analogue scale, VAS).

To collect the peri-implant crevicular fluid, the site will be isolated from saliva using cotton rolls and drying before the sampling. Periopaper strips (Oraflow) will be introduced at the deepest site of the implant sulcus for 30 sec. The volume of peri-implant crevicular fluid will be measured using a Periotron. Until further analysis strips will be store at -80C in sealed plastic tubes previously identified with a code corresponding to the name of the patient. Pro-inflammatory/pleiotropic cytokines, which are found during inflammatory processes at cellular level will be assess. The fluorescence based multiplex protein quantification system (BioPlex, BioRad, Hercules CA, USA) will be used to measure the following eight cytokines: GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α.

Ethical Considerations

The patients will be asked to review and sign a written consent form. Only individuals involved in this study will have access to the data collected during the study. The records for each patient will be assigned with a unique number and will be stored by the principal investigator at her desk within the clinic premises. The master sheet linking the patient identifiers to the unique number will be stored in a safe in the clinic administrative office. In case of possible continuation of line of investigation, the data could be compared with new data (introduction of air abrasive). The master sheet and patient records will be shredded at the end of 4-5 years. To thank them for their participation in the study they will receive a free maintenance appointment at the end of the study (12 months).

Relevance of the study

This study is relevant because there is currently no long term in vivo studies that determine the effectiveness of peri-implant maintenance and also the possible differences and/or similar outcomes between curettes and ultrasonics in the peri-implant maintenance protocol.","Inclusion Criteria:

According to the American Society of Implant Dentistry the dental implant market in the U.S is projected to reach $1.3 billion by 20101. Despite the high success rates of dental implants, it is clear that osseointegrated implants are susceptible to diseases. The prevalence of dental implant complications are rising as the number of individuals that are receiving implant treatment is also increasing. One of these peri-implant complications is an inflammatory condition known as peri-implant mucositis that occurs in 64.6% to 80% of the implant population. The lack of preventive maintenance therapy in subjects with peri-implant mucositis is associated with a high incidence of peri-implantitis, which eventually may lead to implant loss. One important method in the prevention of peri-implant mucositis is the reduction in plaque accumulation, through individual oral hygiene procedures and regular peri-implant professional maintenance. It is highly important that patients be educated about the importance of developing good oral hygiene habits and to attend regular periodontal maintenance appointments. The clinicians have to recognize the significance of monitoring and maintaining peri-implant health. Unfortunately, it is unclear which of the different maintenance regimens and treatments strategies for peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis are more effective. There is lack of information about which peri-implant maintenance protocol offers the best outcome in terms of reduction of inflammation and improved patient comfort. According to Grusovin et al, ""there is only low quality evidence for which are the most effective interventions for maintaining or recovering health of peri-implant soft tissues and there is no reliable evidence as to which regimens are most effective for long term maintenance"". Moreover, current approaches to implant maintenance are somewhat haphazard and not standardized. It is assumed that what is appropriate for teeth is also beneficial for implants; as stated by Persson et al, 2010 ""therapies proposed for the management of peri-implant diseases are currently based on the evidence available from the treatment of periodontitis"". Two conventionally used methods of biofilm and calculus removal from teeth in North America are hand instruments (curettes and scalers) and ultrasonics. In teeth these two modalities of treatment have been studied extensively; conversely, there are fewer studies on dental implants. Renvert et al, 2008 concluded that mechanical non-surgical treatment might be effective to treat peri-implant mucositis but not peri-implantitis; however, the data supporting this literature review was scarce. The same research group compared ultrasonic instrumentation with specific-implant tips to titanium curettes in the treatment of peri-implantitis founding no group differences in the treatment outcomes with improvements in plaque and bleeding scores but no effects on probing depths. In addition, both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts and no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in a six months period. One of the main concerns for dental implants is that metal scalers and ultrasonics generate a roughened surface on the implant, which in turn facilitates plaque accumulation and therefore makes maintenance of plaque free surfaces more difficult. It was observed in a recent study that special coated scalers and ultrasonic tips have been shown in vitro to be compatible with implant surfaces, however this has not been confirmed in vivo. The previous finding is in agreement with a current study, which demonstrated that the roughness values of the titanium surface of implants treated with piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers with a newly developed metallic tip and plastic hand curettes, are equal to the surface's roughness of untreated implants. Mann et al, 2012 showed in an in vitro study that plastic-coated scalers cause minimal damage to the implant surface but leave plastic deposits behind on the implant surface, suggesting further research is needed to evaluate the use of such plastic tips in the debridement of implants. An additional factor, in evaluating the efficacy of different instrumentation in peri-implant maintenance, which needs to be taken into consideration, is patient perception. There is currently no data evaluating patient perception of comfort in regards to hand vs. ultrasonic instrumentation. This information is very important because should both methods of debridement be considered of equal efficacy, patient preference may play a role in the practitioner's selection of instrumentation. Knowing that patient comfort will increase the patient's compliance to the maintenance therapy, further evaluation of this factor is necessary. Long term comparison of ultrasonic and hand instrumentation in the maintenance of peri-implant tissues: A randomized clinical trial Objective The aim of this study is to determine the clinical effects, presence of inflammatory cytokines, and the patients' perceived discomfort by comparing titanium scalers to ultrasonic instrumentation using implant inserts in a patient population with healthy peri-implant tissues and implants with peri-implant mucositis during a one-year period of peri-implant maintenance. Hypothesis There are insufficient studies in the literature to guide the clinician which technique will offer better results in maintaining health or in decreasing inflammation long term around dental implants during peri-implant maintenance. It is postulated in this study that (1) peri-implant therapy will have a beneficial clinical effect, will decrease the presence of inflammatory cytokines and will be well tolerated by the patient population and that (2) there will be no differences in the outcomes between the two peri-implant maintenance therapies.

Assiut University,OTHER,NCT04838379,Ultrasound Guided Rectus Sheath Block and Transversus Abdominis Plane Block,Perioperative Analgesic Effect of Preemptive Ultrasound Guided Rectus Sheath Block and Transversus Abdominis Plane Block With Dexmedetomidine vs Dexamethasone for Laparoscopic Surgery in Paediatrics,The current study aimed to assess the efficacy of Dexmedetomidine (DEX) and Dexamethasone as an adjuvant to ultrasound guided TAP and RS block to prolongation of postoperative analgesia and better pain control in children undergoing laparoscopic surgeries,"Laparoscopic surgeries are one of the most frequently performed paediatric surgeries . Although minimally invasive, this technique is still associated with a significant amount of pain and anxiety in children . Indeed, children who are highly anxious prior to surgery tend to have more postoperative pain, delayed hospital discharge, and higher incidence of emergence delirium, sleep disturbances, and other mal-adaptive behaviour changes that can last up to a few weeks following surgery . To improve analgesia and decrease postoperative anxiety in children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies multimodal approach for pain control can be employed.

Over the past years, the concept of pain management has extended from simply decreasing pain intensity to optimizing patient's condition. The goal is to decrease pain scores, stress response that should be avoided in patients, particularly cardiac patients, together with a decrease in analgesics-related adverse effects like nausea, vomiting, retention of urine and over sedation. By achieving these goals, we can certainly facilitate patient recovery and minimize the hospital stay. Improved pain control can be achieved by a combination of different types of regional analgesia with systemic analgesics. The main contributor to pain post abdominal operations is the pain from abdominal wall incision .

Many procedures were followed to decrease this intense postoperative pain such as, epidural catheter analgesia, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, local wound infiltration, Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA), peripheral nerve blocks, in addition to systemic administration of Non-Steroidal Anti- Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids .

The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a regional anesthetic technique that provides analgesia to the parietal peritoneum as well as to the skin and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall (9-10). Despite a relatively low risk of complications and a high success rate using modern techniques, TAP block remains overwhelmingly underused. Although the technique is technically straightforward, it has not been adopted in clinical practice .

Moreover, The Rectus Sheath Block (RSB) is one of these regional techniques that are suitable for operations with a midline incision or laparoscopic surgery with the main incision at the umbilical port. A previous study showed the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided rectus sheath block for laparoscopic appendectomy compared to a control group injected with saline instead of a local anesthetic Generally, in laparoscopic surgeries, the sites of port incision are associated with considerable postoperative discomfort. Thus, we performed TAP and RS block to ameliorate postoperative pain and improve patient outcomes. In addition to the usefulness of traditional local anesthetics to provide analgesia during the course of the postoperative period is restricted by their short duration of action .

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) and Dexamethasone has been shown as a valuable additives to local anesthetics in neuraxial blocks and peripheral nerve blocks leading to prolongation of postoperative analgesia and better pain control .

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) α-2 adrenergic receptor consists of three α-2 isoreceptors (α-2a, α-2b and α-2c), which regulate the various pharmacodynamic effects of this drug . The α-2a receptor seems to promote sedation and anxiolysis in the locus coeruleus, as well as to generate bradycardia and peripheral vasodilation by stimulation of the cerebral vasomotor center. The α-2b receptor prevents tremor, generates analgesia in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord and determines peripheral vasoconstriction. The α-2c receptor modulates the mental state .

Dexamethasone, a high-potency, long-acting glucocorticoid, has been shown to prolong peripheral nerve blockade . Dexamethasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors and inhibits potassium conductance, which decreases nociceptive C-fiber activity . Dexamethasone may also extend the duration of analgesia via local vasoconstrictive and systemic anti-inflammatory effects .

Thus, we performed TAP and RS block to ameliorate postoperative pain and improve patient outcomes.

Connecticut Children's Medical Center,OTHER,NCT04285879,Blood Flow Restriction Training (BFR) in an Adolescent Population,A Determination of Efficacy and Therapeutic Benefits of Blood Flow Restriction Training in an Adolescent Population,"While there are a number studies that have reported on the use of BFR in the adult population, there is limited information about the use of BFR in the adolescent population. This study aims to evaluate the use of BFR training in conjunction with traditional ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction rehabilitation in adolescents.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the addition of BFR-based exercise to traditional methods of physical therapy. Does the use of BFR-based exercise improve strength, hypertrophy, functional and patient reported outcomes after ACL Reconstruction in the adolescent population?","The planned pilot study is a prospective case control study utilizing retrospective controls. The investigators will compare the use of exercises augmented with BFR with quantitative measurements of strength and patient reported outcomes. A total of 20 youth and adolescent patients undergoing a surgical procedure for ACL reconstruction at Connecticut Children's Elite Sports Medicine and completing physical therapy at Connecticut Children's Sports Physical Therapy will be recruited for this study. A review of data from 20 previous patients, matched for age, sex, BMI and surgical procedure that completed physical therapy at Connecticut Children's Sports Physical Therapy will be used as a comparison.

As part of this pilot study, the investigators will additionally collect prospective controls. This population will be patients not participating in physical therapy at Connecticut Children's, but underwent ACL reconstruction by Elite Sports Medicine. The investigators are unsure of the ability for us to collect prospective controls in a timely manner, hence the investigators will use the above described retrospective cohort as controls if the prospective controls prove difficult to recruit.

Identification and Recruitment:

All potential patients undergoing ACL reconstruction at Elite Sports Medicine will be approached for participation for this study. Eligible patients will be identified at their initial pre-operative appointment with the Sports Medicine Physician, Athletic Trainer, and Sports Physical Therapy Physical Therapist. Subject selection will be completed by those patients meeting the above outlined inclusion and exclusion criteria. At this time, the study purpose and protocol will be explained and a brief summary of the study will be provided.

Consent: Consent will take place at the pre-operative visit. The patient/parent will be given a detailed description of the purpose and methodology for this study. The participants will have the opportunity to read the consent forms and ask any questions they may have about the research. If the patients agree to participate, they will be asked to sign the consent form and a copy will be provided.

Retention: Eligible patients will be required to be seen for a minimum of 90% of patient visits to be included in this study.

In addition to the standard ACL protocol, patients in this study will utilize the Owen Recovery Science exercise protocol for BFR \[18\]. The following guidelines will be followed concerning exercise progression, occlusion pressure and difficulties with volume achievement. To determine the appropriate resistance for each exercise, the patient's 1 repetition maximum (1RM) will be attained using a repetition test \[19\]. This test will use a previously validated algorithm to determine the 1RM based on the weight used to perform a 7-10 repetition test \[20\]. Patient will perform the exercise with a weight they can comfortably lift for several repetitions. Based on the weight or resistance used, and the patient's perceived exertion a 1RM will be estimated using the modified OMNI-RES (OMNI perceived exertion scale for resistance). The starting load for each exercise will be 20-30% of their 1RM , or bodyweight resistance will be used when loading is not feasible.

They can restrict quality of life enormously and give cause to repeated ENT surgery. The basic defect in CF is a dysfunction of chloride channels in exocrine glands, leading to retention of secretions and consecutive chronic inflammation with bacterial superinfections. The prospective placebo controlled cross-over study aims at the evaluation of a nasally inhalation of Pulmozyme with respect to mucus retention and resulting inflammation. Inclusion Criteria: * Subject has a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis based on: 3 positive sweat chloride tests and/or genetic characterisation * Subject is 5 years of age or older * Subject has chronic or recurrent rhinosinusitic disorders * Subject is able to comply with the procedures scheduled in the protocol * Women of childbearing potential are only included into the study, if they are using an effective method of birth control during the protocol (e.g. implants, combined oral contraceptives, injectables, some IUDs, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner) Exclusion Criteria: * Subject has a critical condition defined as: FEV1 \< 30% and / or SaO2 \< 93% without O2-substitution; need of O2-substitution * Subject had an ENT surgery within 6 months prior to study * Subject shows signs of nasal bleeding * Subject has an ear drum perforation * Subject had an acute rhinosinusitis or a pulmonary exacerbation at study entry with need of additional systemic antibiotic therapy * Subject has a new therapy with nasal topic steroids during treatment interval * Subject has a new systemic steroid therapy * Subject is unlikely to comply with the procedures scheduled in the protocol * Subject has a known allergic reaction to the medication * Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding * Patient participates in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to study entry or 30 days after end of the study."
