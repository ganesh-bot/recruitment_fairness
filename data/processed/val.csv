Melek Sahin,OTHER,NCT05668702,Blood Glucose Measurement in Terms Ofg Pain and Result Consistency,A Comparison of Two Regions Used in Capillary Blood Glucose Test in Terms of Pain and Result Consistency,"Abstract Background: Capillary blood glucose measurement is one of the invasive procedures frequently used in clinics, hospitals and home.

Aim: To determine the consistency of pain and results between the palm and fingertip in obtaining blood sample with the intention of monitoring capillary blood glucose.

Design: This study is a crossover design designated. Settings: The research was carried out Diabetes Polyclinic Participants: One hundred thirty Type 2 diabetes patients who went to Diabetes Polyclinic Methods: The research was carried out with 130 Type 2 diabetes patients who went to Diabetes Polyclinic between August and November, 2018. During the data collection, the researcher took venous blood sample in a tube from each patient and according to the list of order determined via randomization scheme formed on the computer, the patients' glucose levels were measured by taking a capillary blood sample from the side of the middle fingertip and palm of the dominant hand with the glucometer. Before the study, the patient's pain assessment at the end of each measurement was carried out by a nurse who was trained by the researcher about the use of Visual Analog Scale.

Keywords: capillary blood sampling; fingertip; glucose; pain; palm","Avoid duplicating information that will be entered elsewhere, such as Eligibility Criteria or Outcome Measures.

The data were collected by the researcher in the diabetes outpatient clinic where there is a sink for handwashing and a suitable area and equipment for blood collection. The researcher interviewed the patients who applied to the diabetes outpatient clinic, informed them about the study and obtained their written consents. After obtaining their written consents, the information of the patients was recorded in the Patient Identification Form. Then, the patients were informed about the use of the Visual Analog Scale. First, venous blood samples of the patients were collected into a tube by the researcher, and then their capillary blood samples were taken. A randomization scheme was created via the website https://www.randomizer.org/ in order to prevent bias during the evaluation of the pain felt due to drawing of capillary blood. According to this randomization order, patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. For capillary blood glucose measurement, two regions, fingertip and palm were used in every patient. In the first group, capillary blood glucose samples were taken first from the fingertip and then from the palm, and in the second group the capillary blood sample was first obtained from the palm and then the fingertip, and blood glucose measurements were made with the glucometer. The patient washed his/her hands with warm water and soap and dried them with a paper towel. Prior to capillary blood collection, the patient washed his/her hands with warm water, kept his hand below the level of the heart, waved downwards and gently massaged his/her fingertips in order to obtain appropriate amount of blood. The dominant hands of the patients were used to collect capillary blood samples. In order not to affect the research results, the same glucometer device was used for all capillary glucose measurements and a new 28G sterile lancet was used in each application. Between capillary blood glucose measurements, an average of 5 minutes was waited for pain assessment with VAS. In order to ensure the objectivity of the study, the nurse, who was trained by the researcher on the use of VAS before the study, evaluated the patient's pain at the end of each capillary blood glucose measurement by using VAS.","Inclusion Criteria:

Study participants are randomized to use of barbed suture (2-0 V-Loc 90TM, Medtronic) or non-barbed suture (2-0 Polydioxanone, PDS® EthiconTM) in a standardized technique for posterior colporrhaphy at the time of posterior repair.","Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a growing concern for the aging female population, and symptomatic women often require surgical intervention. Approximately 200,000 surgical procedures for POP are performed annually in the United States. This number is anticipated to increase with the growth in the aging population.1 Surgical prolapse repairs are often categorized into either mesh augmented or native tissue repairs. During a native tissue repair, the surgeon uses a woman's natural tissue to repair the prolapse without augmenting the repair with synthetic mesh.

Women often have post-operative pain with native tissue posterior colporrhaphy. Native tissue posterior repairs are performed to address symptomatic posterior compartment prolapse, defects in the rectovaginal fibromuscularis, and/or a widened genital hiatus. This type of repair may improve obstructed defecatory dysfunction and bulge symptoms, but can be associated with postoperative pelvic pain and dyspareunia. Paraiso et al evaluated three surgical techniques for posterior colporrhaphy (site-specific, midline plication, and porcine graft) and found no difference in overall symptom improvement, quality of life, and post-operative sexual function. Regardless of the technique used, a posterior colporrhaphy can cause considerable postoperative pain and can contribute to de novo dyspareunia in 9-20% of women. Most studies evaluating pain after posterior colporrhaphy tend to focus on various methods of analgesia and surgical technique rather than the suture materials used.

Suture choice may contribute to postoperative pain at the time of posterior colporrhaphy. There are few studies evaluating suture in the posterior compartment with no defined standard suture material for posterior colporrhaphy. Available studies, when comparing subjective bulge and quality of life outcomes, do not demonstrate superiority of one suture type over the other. Delayed absorbable suture has the benefit of retaining tensile strength for approximately 3 months. Delayed absorbable suture material itself, however, can remain in place for up to 8 months. These properties may decrease postoperative pain by decreasing knot burden. Barbed suture has been successfully applied to vaginal cuff closure, myomectomy, sacrocolpopexy mesh attachment, and closure of bowel and bladder injuries with demonstrated reduced operative times. To date, no studies have evaluated the impact of barbed suture on postoperative pain or surgical time after posterior colporrhaphy.

The primary objective for this study is to compare delayed absorbable barbed suture versus non-barbed delayed absorbable suture at the time of posterior repair on post-operative posterior compartment pain scores, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), at 6 weeks

Secondary objectives include a comparison of VAS pain scores in the posterior compartment at 6-months, evaluation of operative time for posterior repair in minutes, evaluation of suture burden and pelvic pain on examination of the posterior compartment, evaluation of pain versus the length of a repair, evaluation of postoperative patient quality of life (QoL) using series of standardized questionnaires, evaluation of suture cost, and a comparison of anatomical and surgical failure in the posterior compartment.

Unity Health Toronto,OTHER,NCT00338702,"A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Autologous Platelet Gel Treatment in Diabetic Foot Ulcers",,"Foot ulcers represent a significant common complication in patients with diabetes. Wound healing is a challenge. Some wounds do not respond to the best practices in wound care. Considerable effort has been directed at therapies to improve the rate of healing.

There are a variety of growth factors which have been used to stimulate wound healing. Human platelets are an autologous source of growth factors which probably can stimulate healing. Autologous platelet gel (APG) is prepared by centrifugation of autologous human whole blood. APG is rich in platelet growth factors. This study will investigate the potential improvement in wound healing with this material in diabetic foot ulcers.

This study will compare the use of autologous platelet gel ( study group) and standard care ( control group) in the treatment of diabetic plantar forefoot ulcers. This study will also compare the cost and quality of life in the two groups.

Objectives of the study:

* To determine if topical APG (autologous platelet gel) is beneficial in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.
* To determine if it will result in a faster rate of wound healing.
* To determine if it will improve the quality of life in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.","Study Design This will be a single center, randomized, controlled, prospective study comparing the use of autologous platelet gel (study group) and traditional moist dressing (control group) in the treatment of plantar forefoot ulcers.

Specific Aims Primary - Facilitation of healing of diabetic foot ulcers Secondary - Reduction in amputations and average total cost of care. Determine the impact of diabetic ulcers on patients' quality of life Research Background Foot ulcers represent a significant common complication in patients with diabetes. It is estimated that twenty percent of all patients with diabetes develop a foot ulcer which may subsequently lead to below knee amputation. 85 % of them preceded by non-healing foot ulcers.

Health care costs associated with diabetic foot wound management are staggering. Armstrong et al (1998) reported that wound care for foot ulcer patients over a two year period had mean cost of $27,000.00 U.S. In Toronto, the average cost of below knee amputations, including hospitalization and rehabilitation, is $40,000.00.

Wound healing in the context of diabetes is a challenge for both the health care provider and the patient. In a systematic review conducted by Margolis et al (1999), wound healing outcomes using best practices have yielded only 24% at 12 weeks, 31% in 20 weeks.

Falanga \& Sabolinski (2001) identified that initial wound size reduction of 0.1 cm/week is highly predictive of wound closure whereas initial healing rates 0.06 cm or less predict non-healing. Similarly, 51% percent reduction in 4 weeks was found to be a good predictor of achieving wound closure (Margolis et al, 1999). Some wounds do not respond and considerable effort has been directed at therapies to improve the rate of healing in this situation.

A variety of growth factors which have been used to stimulate wound healing. Human platelets are an autologous source which probably can stimulate healing. Autologous platelet gel (APG) is a material presently utilized as a tissue adhesive. It is derived from platelet rich plasma (PRP) that was first developed in the early 1990's to primarily address acute surgical hemostatic and wound healing problems.

APG is prepared by centrifugation of autologous human whole blood, which initially separates it into three components: packed red cells, platelet poor plasma, and platelet rich plasma (PRP). PRP has two to eight times the normal concentration of platelets in human blood. The key element that differentiates APG from traditional fibrin glue is the presence of concentrated platelets rich in platelet growth factors. These important elements of the blood, in an increased concentration are potentially helpful in improving the rate of wound healing. This study will investigate the potential improvement in wound healing with APG in diabetic foot ulcers.

Detection of osteomyelitis that is not treatable by debridement and antibiotics at the discretion of the investigator 3. Development of progressive wound necrosis Experimental Methods For study purposes, diabetic foot ulcer will be a wound on the plantar aspect of the foot which has not responded to at least 4 weeks of best practice care. Complete wound closure will be defined as skin closure (100% re-epithelization) without drainage or dressing requirements.

Patients seeking treatment for diabetic foot ulcers that meet the entry criteria will be considered for the study. Patients will be randomized to either the STUDY or the CONTROL group with a 1:1 control to study ratio.

STUDY Group Patients will have APG (autologous platelet gel) applied to the wound in accordance with institutional treatment protocols and manufacturer's guidelines. Dressing changes will occur at least three times a week.

Method of preparing and application of autologous platelet gel is as follows -

1. Obtain 54 cc of whole blood into a 60 cc syringe with 6 cc of citrate anticoagulant through standard blood draw technique.
2. Slowly load blood filled syringe into GPS II unit's centre port. And centrifuge for 15 minutes.
3. Draw PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) concentrate from GPS II unit into a 10 cc syringe.
4. Prepare the wound bed through sharp excision of the eperbole, necrotic tissue \& wound bed.
5. Aspirate PPP (Platelet Poor Plasma) from GPSII unit in to a 30 ml syringe.
6. Inject Thrombin Reagent (5 cc of CaCl2) to Thrombin Processing Device and then add 11 cc of the PPP from the syringe and after mixing let it stand for 20 minutes.
7. Draw 1 cc of thrombin/CaCl2 solution into a 1 cc syringe from Thrombin Processing Device.
8. Connect syringe with PRP and syringe with thrombin/CaCl2 to a dual sprayer
9. Spray solutions over entire wound bed. Protect surrounding skin (but not into the wound) with barrier film.
10. Apply a semi-permeable, film-type dressing as primary dressing. Leave dressing in place for 3-7 days.
11. The affected limb will receive offloading in the form of a total contact cast, a pneumatic walking cast or wheelchair.
12. After the first dressing with APG the wound will be dressed with a moist dressing, similar to control group dressings. The dressings will be changed daily or on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine based on the level of exudates.

CONTROL Group

Weekly standard therapy alone as follows:

1. Any debridement deemed necessary is performed
2. Ulcer-site will be dressed with a moist dressing such as cadexamer iodine ointment (Iodosorb) and an absorbent covering dressing that is moisture retentive. Acceptable other control group dressing types are: alginates, hydrogels and hydrocolloids and saline gauze. The dressing will be changed daily or on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine based on the level of exudate.
3. The affected limb will receive offloading in the form of a total contact cast, a pneumatic walking cast or wheelchair.

Treatment Phase of the Study: Treatment in both groups will continue until the wound is successfully closed.

At 12 weeks (3 months) wounds from both control and treatment groups will be evaluated. If the wound does not show any signs of improvement (wound closure by 50% at 3 months) the wound will be considered as a treatment failure and it will be treated with alternate dressing according to hospital standard of care. These wounds will be followed every month till they close.

6-Month and 12 month follow-up: For patients who achieved wound closure at 12 weeks, or later the wound site will undergo an examination for recurrence.

No patient will remain in the study for longer than 12 months (total study duration).

Clinical Assessments A. Wound Debridement All wounds under study will be surgically debrided The wound may be debrided by autolysis or sharp wound debridement as tolerated.

B. Laboratory Testing Up to seven days prior to the initiation of protocol treatment, blood samples will be taken to determine serum pre-albumin, albumin and creatinine levels. If the pre-albumin is \<16 mg/dl (\<160 mg/L) or the albumin level is \<3 g/dl (\<30 g/L), nutritional supplementation will be started.

Wound healing is a challenge. Some wounds do not respond to the best practices in wound care. Considerable effort has been directed at therapies to improve the rate of healing. There are a variety of growth factors which have been used to stimulate wound healing. Human platelets are an autologous source of growth factors which probably can stimulate healing. Autologous platelet gel (APG) is prepared by centrifugation of autologous human whole blood. APG is rich in platelet growth factors. This study will investigate the potential improvement in wound healing with this material in diabetic foot ulcers. This study will compare the use of autologous platelet gel ( study group) and standard care ( control group) in the treatment of diabetic plantar forefoot ulcers. This study will also compare the cost and quality of life in the two groups. Objectives of the study: * To determine if topical APG (autologous platelet gel) is beneficial in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. * To determine if it will result in a faster rate of wound healing. * To determine if it will improve the quality of life in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Study Design This will be a single center, randomized, controlled, prospective study comparing the use of autologous platelet gel (study group) and traditional moist dressing (control group) in the treatment of plantar forefoot ulcers. Specific Aims Primary - Facilitation of healing of diabetic foot ulcers Secondary - Reduction in amputations and average total cost of care. Determine the impact of diabetic ulcers on patients' quality of life Research Background Foot ulcers represent a significant common complication in patients with diabetes. It is estimated that twenty percent of all patients with diabetes develop a foot ulcer which may subsequently lead to below knee amputation. 85 % of them preceded by non-healing foot ulcers. Health care costs associated with diabetic foot wound management are staggering. Armstrong et al (1998) reported that wound care for foot ulcer patients over a two year period had mean cost of $27,000.00 U.S. In Toronto, the average cost of below knee amputations, including hospitalization and rehabilitation, is $40,000.00. Wound healing in the context of diabetes is a challenge for both the health care provider and the patient. In a systematic review conducted by Margolis et al (1999), wound healing outcomes using best practices have yielded only 24% at 12 weeks, 31% in 20 weeks. Falanga \& Sabolinski (2001) identified that initial wound size reduction of 0.1 cm/week is highly predictive of wound closure whereas initial healing rates 0.06 cm or less predict non-healing. Similarly, 51% percent reduction in 4 weeks was found to be a good predictor of achieving wound closure (Margolis et al, 1999). Some wounds do not respond and considerable effort has been directed at therapies to improve the rate of healing in this situation. A variety of growth factors which have been used to stimulate wound healing. Human platelets are an autologous source which probably can stimulate healing. Autologous platelet gel (APG) is a material presently utilized as a tissue adhesive. It is derived from platelet rich plasma (PRP) that was first developed in the early 1990's to primarily address acute surgical hemostatic and wound healing problems. APG is prepared by centrifugation of autologous human whole blood, which initially separates it into three components: packed red cells, platelet poor plasma, and platelet rich plasma (PRP). PRP has two to eight times the normal concentration of platelets in human blood. The key element that differentiates APG from traditional fibrin glue is the presence of concentrated platelets rich in platelet growth factors. These important elements of the blood, in an increased concentration are potentially helpful in improving the rate of wound healing. This study will investigate the potential improvement in wound healing with APG in diabetic foot ulcers. Rationale for the Research * To determine if topical APG (autologous platelet gel) is beneficial in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. * To determine if it will result in a faster rate of wound healing. * To determine if it will improve the quality of life in patients with diabetic foot ulcers Study Population Subjects for this study will be recruited from our patient population.

Ulcer with exposed bone or tendon Withdrawal Criteria 1. The patient may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the investigator if judged noncompliant with study procedures or worsening patient condition 2. Detection of osteomyelitis that is not treatable by debridement and antibiotics at the discretion of the investigator 3. Development of progressive wound necrosis Experimental Methods For study purposes, diabetic foot ulcer will be a wound on the plantar aspect of the foot which has not responded to at least 4 weeks of best practice care. Complete wound closure will be defined as skin closure (100% re-epithelization) without drainage or dressing requirements. Patients seeking treatment for diabetic foot ulcers that meet the entry criteria will be considered for the study. Patients will be randomized to either the STUDY or the CONTROL group with a 1:1 control to study ratio. STUDY Group Patients will have APG (autologous platelet gel) applied to the wound in accordance with institutional treatment protocols and manufacturer's guidelines. Dressing changes will occur at least three times a week. Method of preparing and application of autologous platelet gel is as follows - 1. Obtain 54 cc of whole blood into a 60 cc syringe with 6 cc of citrate anticoagulant through standard blood draw technique. 2. Slowly load blood filled syringe into GPS II unit's centre port. And centrifuge for 15 minutes. 3. Draw PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) concentrate from GPS II unit into a 10 cc syringe. 4. Prepare the wound bed through sharp excision of the eperbole, necrotic tissue \& wound bed. 5. Aspirate PPP (Platelet Poor Plasma) from GPSII unit in to a 30 ml syringe. 6. Inject Thrombin Reagent (5 cc of CaCl2) to Thrombin Processing Device and then add 11 cc of the PPP from the syringe and after mixing let it stand for 20 minutes. 7. Draw 1 cc of thrombin/CaCl2 solution into a 1 cc syringe from Thrombin Processing Device. 8. Connect syringe with PRP and syringe with thrombin/CaCl2 to a dual sprayer 9. Spray solutions over entire wound bed. Protect surrounding skin (but not into the wound) with barrier film. 10. Apply a semi-permeable, film-type dressing as primary dressing. Leave dressing in place for 3-7 days. 11. The affected limb will receive offloading in the form of a total contact cast, a pneumatic walking cast or wheelchair. 12. After the first dressing with APG the wound will be dressed with a moist dressing, similar to control group dressings. The dressings will be changed daily or on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine based on the level of exudates. CONTROL Group Weekly standard therapy alone as follows: 1. Any debridement deemed necessary is performed 2. Ulcer-site will be dressed with a moist dressing such as cadexamer iodine ointment (Iodosorb) and an absorbent covering dressing that is moisture retentive. Acceptable other control group dressing types are: alginates, hydrogels and hydrocolloids and saline gauze. The dressing will be changed daily or on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine based on the level of exudate. 3. The affected limb will receive offloading in the form of a total contact cast, a pneumatic walking cast or wheelchair. Treatment Phase of the Study: Treatment in both groups will continue until the wound is successfully closed. At 12 weeks (3 months) wounds from both control and treatment groups will be evaluated. If the wound does not show any signs of improvement (wound closure by 50% at 3 months) the wound will be considered as a treatment failure and it will be treated with alternate dressing according to hospital standard of care. These wounds will be followed every month till they close. 6-Month and 12 month follow-up: For patients who achieved wound closure at 12 weeks, or later the wound site will undergo an examination for recurrence. No patient will remain in the study for longer than 12 months (total study duration). Clinical Assessments A. Wound Debridement All wounds under study will be surgically debrided The wound may be debrided by autolysis or sharp wound debridement as tolerated. B. Laboratory Testing Up to seven days prior to the initiation of protocol treatment, blood samples will be taken to determine serum pre-albumin, albumin and creatinine levels. If the pre-albumin is \<16 mg/dl (\<160 mg/L) or the albumin level is \<3 g/dl (\<30 g/L), nutritional supplementation will be started. The tests will be repeated at 12 weeks or at the time of wound closure which ever comes first. Determination of HbA1c will be performed up to 30 days prior to initiation of protocol treatment, and at 12 weeks or at the time of wound closure which ever comes first. Bacterial culture will be done at Day 0. Additional cultures may be obtained as clinically indicated. C. Wound Examination Ulcers will be examined at Days 0, 7 (1 wk), 14 (2wk), 28 (4wk) , 56 (8wk), 84 (12wk), 6 and 12 month follow up visits.

University Medicine Greifswald,OTHER,NCT00558584,Multicenter Study of Immunoadsorption in Dilated Cardiomyopathy,"Multicentre, Randomized, Double-blind, Prospective Investigation on the Effects of Immunoadsorption on Cardiac Function in Patients With Dilated Cardiomyopathy",The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of immunoadsorption and subsequent IgG substitution in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy compared to a control group.,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement and systolic dysfunction with normal LV wall thickness. According to reports heretofore, the incidence of this disorder in industrialized Western countries lies within the order of magnitude of 5 - 8 new illnesses per year for every 100,000 population. The prevalence, accordingly, is approximately 36 patients for every 100,000 population. However, recent data suggest higher actual prevalence of DCM: at present the estimated prevalence of congestive heart failure ranges from 2% to 6%. According to recently published studies (e.g., the MERIT-HF study and the COPERNICUS study), about 30% to 35% of patients with congestive heart failure suffer from non-ischemic myocardial heart disease. DCM was diagnosed, furthermore, in 12% of the patients of the CIBIS II study. Approximately 26% of the patients with reduced left-ventricular systolic function from the CHARM-added study suffered from heart failure due to DCM. Based on these data, assumption is justified that in Germany approximately 500,000 patients suffer from DCM. Despite advances in medical treatment of heart failure, the general prognosis for DCM is poor. In many cases, treatment options are surgical e.g., heart transplantation or implantation of an assist device.

An association between virus myocarditis and DCM has been hypothesized for a subset of patients with DCM. Both experimental and clinical data indicate that viral infection and inflammatory processes are involved in the pathogenesis of myocarditis and DCM, and may represent important factors causing progression of ventricular dysfunction.

Abnormalities of the cellular immune system are present in patients with myocarditis and DCM. For patients with DCM, immunohistological methods have been introduced for diagnosis of myocardial inflammation. Infiltration with lymphocytes and mononuclear cells as well as increased expression of cell adhesion molecules, are frequent phenomena in DCM. These findings support the hypothesis that the immune process is still active. Furthermore, activation of the humoral immune system with production of cardiac antibodies plays an important role in DCM. Several antibodies against cardiac structures have been detected in DCM patients - including antibodies that act against mitochondrial proteins, alpha- and beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms, the cardiac beta-receptor, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-2, and the sarcolemmal Na-K-ATPase. The functional significance of cardiac autoantibodies is under debate. It is possible that autoantibodies are formed as a consequence of inflammatory reactions to cellular destruction, in which case they should be regarded as an epiphenomenon. Cardiac autoantibodies, on the other hand, may likewise play an active role in the pathogenesis of DCM by triggering the disease process, or by contributing to development of myocardial contractile dysfunction. For certain antibodies, in-vitro data indicate a negative effect on cardiac performance. In myocarditis and DCM, heart-reactive cytotoxic auto-antibodies to the ADP/ATP carrier were found. These antibodies cross-react with the calcium channel of the cardiomyocytes. Purified antibodies obtained from DCM patients induce a negative inotropic effect in isolated rat cardiomyocytes by decreasing the calcium transients. Immunization of rodents against peptides derived from cardiovascular G-protein receptors induces morphological changes of myocardial tissue resembling DCM. Furthermore, recent data have provided evidence those antibodies against the beat1-receptor itself induce DCM: rats immunized against the second extracellular loop of cardiac beta1-receptors develop progressive left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. Interestingly, sera transferred from these immunized animals to unsensitized rats induced the similar cardiomyopathic phenotype, thus demonstrating the pathogenic potential of a particular antibody for development of DCM. Further confirmation of the principle that autoantibodies contribute to induction of the disease process and to progression to DCM has been provided in a recent study. The authors showed that mice deficient in the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immunoinhibitory co-receptor develop autoimmune DCM with production of high-titre circulating IgG autoantibodies reactive to a 33-kilodalton protein expressed specifically on the surface of cardiomyocytes. This antigen was recently identified as cardiac troponin I.

When cardiac antibodies impair cardiac function, their removal would logically be expected to lead to an improvement in the patient's haemodynamic situation. Cardiac antibodies belong to the IgG fraction and can be eliminated by immunoadsorption (IA) therapy. Immunoadsorption has been introduced as a method for treatment of autoimmune processes e.g., Goodpasture's syndrome and lupus erythematodes. This form of therapy has already been successfully applied for treatment of DCM. Several pilot studies have shown that IA improves cardiac function in patients with DCM. The first uncontrolled pilot study disclosed acute beneficial haemodynamic effects of IA in patients with severe heart failure due to DCM. A randomized study followed, to investigate the haemodynamic effects of additional IA therapy for DCM. This study included patients with DCM (NYHA III-IV, LVEF \<30%) who were under stable medication. In the IA group, IA was conducted on three consecutive days, with one IA session daily. On the grounds of safety - i.e., to reduce the risk of infection after immunoglobulin depletion - immunoglobulin G was substituted after the last IA session. Immunoadsorption and subsequent IgG substitution (IA/IgG) was repeated for 3 courses at monthly intervals until month 3. In contrast to the control group, patients in the IA/IgG group demonstrated after 3 months a significant increase in cardiac index (CI), paralleled by a similar increase in stroke volume index. A recent study demonstrated that IA/IgG therapy likewise mitigates the inflammatory process in the myocardium of DCM patients. A case-controlled study, performed by others, conducted IA in one course of 5 consecutive days without IgG substitution subsequent to immunoglobulin depletion. This study did not repeat IA during follow-up. In this study, LVEF increased from 22 to 40% one year after IA: a significant gain in contrast to the control group without IA therapy.

Recent data indicate that the beneficial haemodynamic effects of IA are related to removal of negative inotropic cardiac antibodies. Detection of cardio-depressant antibodies in the plasma of DCM patients, before IA, effectively predicts acute and prolonged haemodynamic improvement during IA. A further study clearly disclosed that the cardio depressant antibodies belong to the IG-3 subclass \[38\]. The removal of antibodies of the IgG-3 subclass accordingly represents an essential mechanism in IA therapy of DCM.

Protein-A and anti-IgG columns are licensed for IA. Anti-IgG sepharose effectively eliminates all IgG subclasses, including IgG-3. Protein A binds to the Fc part of human IgG-1, -2, -4. However, the affinity of protein A to IgG-3 is low. IgG-3 removal can be markedly increased by protein-A, through the use of an optimized treatment regime, by prolonging the IA course to 4 - 5 sessions, and by reducing the loading volume of the protein columns with plasma. In use of this adsorption regime for IgG-3 elimination, protein-A IA induces significant acute and prolonged haemodynamic improvement of DCM patients. Furthermore, IA treatment with protein A adsorption performed in 1 course on 5 consecutive days induces improvement of the left ventricular function of DCM patients over a period of 6 months, with results comparable to those received by IA treatment repeated in 4 courses at monthly intervals. Despite optimized medical treatment, the prognosis of DCM is still poor. For most patients, heart transplantation will represent the only palliative treatment option. Alternative therapeutic strategies for treatment of DCM are consequently of essential interest.

This randomized multicentre study will investigate for the first time by means of a double-blind study design whether a specific causal intervention - i.e., the removal of autoantibodies - will influence the disease process and improve the cardiac function of patients suffering from heart failure due to DCM.","Inclusion Criteria:

Driving behavior is a high cognitively demanding task, and whether the Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) can continue to drive is an important issue. This study will develop the Taiwan version of innovative, immediate feedback and environmentally safe Senior Driving Simulation Training (SDST). This study aims to establish the Senior Driving Simulation Training (SDST) for Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and explore the effectiveness of Senior Driving Simulation Training (SDST) on the executive function, cognitive function and EEG. The investigators intend to conduct a single-blind randomized controlled trial using a two-arm parallel-group design. Participants will be randomized by the permuted block randomization, block size of 4, into an experimental group (Senior Driving Simulation Training: 30-mins training session two times per week for 5 weeks, with a total of 10 sessions) or a control group (Waiting list). The investigators plan to blind the therapists and outcome assessors to maintain the blinding methods' quality. The primary outcome indicators are mental set-shifting, working memory, and inhibition. The secondary outcome indicators are cognitive function and EEG. The investigators also evaluate visual awareness and simulator sickness. The short-term (immediate post-test) and the long-term (3, 6, and 12 months) effectiveness of the intervention on individual outcome measures will be analyzed by the generalized estimating equation. The investigators also plan to use the secondary data analysis methods to investigate the relationship between objective indicators of a driving simulator, executive function, cognitive function, EEG, visual awareness, and simulator sickness. Furthermore, the investigators will analyze the trend of EEG while the participants conducting the training, and complete the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Cognitive Change Index (C-CCI). This will be the first senior driving simulation training (SDST) for Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in Taiwan.

University of Manchester,OTHER,NCT03733184,Development of an IDEAL Framework to Standardise Cytoreductive Surgery for Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases,Development of an IDEAL Framework to Standardise the Complex Intervention of Cytoreductive Surgery for Colorectal Peritoneal Metastases: a Necessary Step to Phase III Trials,"Cytoreduction surgery (CRS) followed by hyperthermic intra-operative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a relatively new treatment for selected patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin (PMCR). Data from outside of trials suggest that CRS and HIPEC improves survival compared with the current standard care (chemotherapy).

The big challenge is to do trials in this setting - as the intervention is complex, and there are wide variations in the process and recording of outcomes. If trials can confirm the findings from non-randomised studies there are an estimated 1000 to 2000 patients who may benefit from this intervention in the UK each year. The aim of this study is to develop a framework which can be used to undertake a randomised trial in patients with PMCR suitable for CRS with or without HIPEC.

The investigators will address this using the principles of the IDEAL (Idea, Development, Evaluation, Assessment \& Long term study) framework. Here, a pre-trial feasibility study will be performed between the two national peritoneal tumour treatment centres (Manchester and Basingstoke).

This study is designed as such that it will take place over the following four stages:

Stage 1. Comparing the treatment data from 100 operations from each of the two centres to identify which of the key components of the intervention differ as well as testing for differences in overall survival and recurrence free survival.

Stage 2. Identifying sources of these differences by selecting up to 25 patients and investigating the variation in the way surgeons score key aspects of the procedure

Stage 3. Development of a 'trial manual' with standardised definitions (to minimise any differences)

Stage 4. Test how well people follow the manual in practice. After this study is complete, it will be possible to use the resulting trial manual to design future randomised trials to test the most suitable clinical question.","The 2010 National Institute Centre for Excellence (NICE) IGP331 guidance recognised that there is sufficient evidence (mainly from non-randomised comparative studies) that cytoreduction surgery (CRS) followed by hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), in selected patients with peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin (PMCR), improves survival compared with systemic chemotherapy, current standard care. The guidance recognised that this intervention is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, and accordingly, should be delivered with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and research, and include trials.

In the UK, with 37,000 new colorectal cancers per annum, there are an estimated 1000 to 2000 patients who may benefit from this intervention. There are currently two treatment centres (Manchester and Basingstoke), with additional new centres in Birmingham and Dublin starting to roll out to meet this unmet need.

There is only one published randomised trial in this field, which is now mainly historic (2003). There are a small number of on-going trials, but these are small-scale and have encountered various early problems, which can be summarised as follows:

(i) Wide variation in the treatment process, such that there has been between-arm imbalances in key prognostic components (such as different case mix between arms); and

(ii) Wide variation of the reported treatment-related outcomes, such that it is unclear whether results are generalizable to other centres.

There are potentially two broad sources of this variability :

(i) Wide variation in clinical practice (ii) Poorly-reproducible methods of recording key prognostic factors and outcomes

With the 'new wave' of emerging peritoneal tumour (PT) treatment centres, across the UK and Ireland, there are opportunities to integrate phase III trials into this clinical network - hence the timing of this study. In the past 12 months, there have been two meetings (Basingstoke: April 2014; December 2014) outlining the frameworks on which to develop new PT treatment centres, benchmarked against the established reference centres (Manchester and Basingstoke). These meetings have strongly supported the parallel development of an integrated PT research network.

The overarching aim of this study is to develop a robust and reproducible framework in which to undertake a phase III trial in patients with PMCR suitable for CRS with or without HIPEC. As CRS with HIPEC is a complex multi-component intervention, this agenda will be addressed using the principles of the IDEAL (Idea, Development, Evaluation, Assessment \& Long term study) framework.

Stage 1 - Documenting between-centre variability For the first stage of the study, 200 eligible patients will be identified from prospective databases located at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust and Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. In both cases, the data extracted will be extracted from pre-existing databases and will be fully anonymised and at no point will the research team see any patient identifiable information. The anonymised data will be entered into a password protected Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet and sent using secure NHS Mail account to the study co-ordinator.

To investigate the between-centre variability the investigators will collect the following 19 core variables from 100 patients from each trust:

1. Age at time of operation
2. Gender
3. WHO Performance Status
4. Primary Vs Secondary Surgery
5. Previous chemotherapy - If Yes - regimen, date and dose
6. Nodal status at diagnosis and time or surgery
7. HIPEC regimen used
8. Primary Tumour Site
9. Blood transfusion requirements
10. Duration of operation
11. Peritoneal cancer index (PCI Score)
12. Cytoreduction completeness score
13. Type of Stoma
14. Highest complication grade
15. Peri-operative 30-day mortality
16. Date Last Seen
17. Date of Recurrence
18. Date of Initial Cytoreduction \& HIPEC
19. Date of Death (if applicable)

The data collected will then be analysed to establish if there are any significant differences between the variables collected from each dataset. This will be primarily carried out by the project statistician using STATA 14 software.

Stage 2 - Identifying sources of variability The second stage will focus on reproducibility and explore within and between-observer sources of variability. The procedure for this stage will be partially dependant on the findings from the analysis at the end of stage 1. However, the main focus will be on the assessment of intra-operative staging \[namely Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) score\] - the best available instrument to stratify case-mix.

This stage of this study involves intra-operative photographs \& videos of intra-abdominal tumour deposits in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery for peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin. The photographs \& videos will be taken in a systematic manner through 13 zones, using an internationally recognised grid, to derive patient-level scores of the burden of tumour. The only risk to patients is approximately 15 minutes additional anaesthetic time. The study requires 12 patients with complete recordings of all 13 zones - it is estimated that up to 25 patients might need to be consented to derive a full complement of 12 sets. These individuals will consent to partake in the study. The scores will be linked with other patient-level clinical, pathological, and imaging data.

Patient identification and recruitment process Patients will first be identified at the weekly colorectal Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting by the colorectal consultant supervising the study. The selected patients will later be approached by a core member of the clinical team during their pre-op clinic visit to participate in the study. A patient information sheet will be handed to them at least 24 hours before they are required to consent for the study. This will contain all the details of the study and state that participation is voluntary. There will also be details on how to withdraw from the study if so desired.

Once all the required photographs \& videos have been collected, they will be imported into a secure database and used to create an electronic survey for colorectal surgeons based within the UK and internationally. Each surgeon will be sent a link to the survey where they will first view a welcome page informing them of the process.

They will then proceed to view a set of videos taken at the start of an operation and then asked to assess how they would score the PCI. Once they have entered a score between 0 and 39, they will then go on to view the photographs/videos taken after the cytoreduction has been performed and assess how they would rate the CC score (CC0, CC1, CC2 or CC3). They will then go on to do the same for the remaining procedures. The order in which the procedures appear will be randomised in order to reduce any scoring bias. Once all required consultants have completed the survey, the scores will be extracted and analysed for inter-observer variation.

Stage 3 - Development of trial manual to standardise variation The next stage of the study is to utilities the Delphi method to send out a modified version of the electronic questionnaire over a number of rounds. The results from the initial questionnaire sent out in Stage 2 will be analysed to establish which regions had agreement from less than 70% of the participants.

The survey will then be redistributed with a set of explanations \& definitions which will aim to have participants converge on the same (""correct"") score. In addition, each answer will display the percentage of participants who selected each score in the previous round. If there continues to be regions with an agreement level of less than 70%, additional rounds will take place with further definitions based on the feedback received until all regions have reached the required level of agreement.

Stage 4 - Testing of the trial manual The final stage of the project will be to test the fidelity of the trial manual assembled in stage 3. The workshop that takes place in stage 3 will involve a discussion of exactly which components of the trial manual are to be audited. This audit will take place during the final three months of the project and will use the same databases from the first stage of the study. In addition, the scoring of PCI and CC scores will be re-assessed using the same images \& videos captured in stage 2 of the study to see if there has been any standardisation in the scoring since the manual was distributed.

The results from this audit will be sent to the colorectal surgery teams at all involved centres and if required, will highlight any areas of the trial manual that do not appear to be adhered to.

At the end of stage 1, 2 and 3 the data collected will be analysed by the project statistician. STATA 14 software will be used to compare baseline and matched characteristics between patients treated at The Christie NHS FT and Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. This will be done by using standard tests for continuous variables (Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, respectively) and categorical variables (χ² and McNemar tests, respectively).

The results from the staff questionnaire will also be used to investigate between and within-observer variability.","Inclusion Criteria:

City University of New York,OTHER,NCT03669302,Activity-Dependent Transspinal Stimulation in SCI,Activity-Dependent Transspinal Stimulation for Recovery of Walking Ability After Spinal Cord Injury,"Robotic gait training is often used with the aim to improve walking ability in individuals with Spinal Cord Injury. However, robotic gait training alone may not be sufficient. This study will compare the effects of robotic gait training alone to robotic gait training combined with either low-frequency or high-frequency non-invasive transspinal electrical stimulation. In people with motor-incomplete SCI, a series of clinical and electrical tests of nerve function will be performed before and after 20 sessions of gait training with or without stimulation.","People with spinal cord injury (SCI) have motor dysfunction that results in substantial social, personal, and economic costs. Robotic gait training is often used with the aim to improve walking ability in these individuals. Investigators recently reported that robotic gait training reorganizes spinal neuronal circuits, improves motor activity, and contributes substantially to recovery of walking ability in people with motor incomplete SCI. However, pathological muscle tone and abnormal muscle activation patterns during assisted stepping were still evident after multiple sessions of robotic gait training. Locomotor training alone may thus be insufficient to strengthen weak neuronal synapses connecting the brain with the spinal cord or to fully optimize spinal neural circuits. On the other hand, spinal cord stimulation increases sprouting and plasticity of axons and dendrites in spinalized animals. Furthermore, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (termed here transspinal stimulation) in people with SCI can evoke rhythmic leg muscle activity when gravity is eliminated. A fundamental knowledge gap still exists on induction of functional neuroplasticity and recovery of leg motor function after repetitive thoracolumbar transspinal stimulation during body weight supported (BWS) assisted stepping in people with SCI. The central working hypothesis in this study is that transspinal stimulation delivered during BWS-assisted stepping provides a tonic excitatory input increasing the overall responsiveness of the spinal cord and improving motor output. The investigators will address 3 specific aims: Establish induction of neuroplasticity and improvements in leg sensorimotor function in people with motor incomplete SCI when transspinal stimulation is delivered during BWS-assisted stepping at low frequencies (0.3 Hz; Specific Aim 1) and at high frequencies (30 Hz; Specific Aim 2), and when BWS-assisted step training is administered without transspinal stimulation (Specific Aim 3). In all groups, outcomes after 20 sessions will be measured via state-of-the-art neurophysiological methods. Corticospinal circuit excitability will be measured via transcranial magnetic stimulation motor evoked potentials in seated subjects (Aims 1A, 2A, 3A). Soleus H-reflex and tibialis anterior flexor reflex excitability patterns will be measured during assisted stepping (Aims 1B, 2B, 3B). Sensorimotor function will be evaluated via standardized clinical tests of gait and strength (Aims 1C, 2C, 3C). Additionally, poly-electromyographic analysis of coordinated muscle activation will be measured in detail. It is hypothesized that transspinal stimulation at 30 Hz during assisted stepping improves leg motor function and decreases ankle spasticity more compared to 0.3 Hz. It is further hypothesized that transspinal stimulation at 30 Hz normalizes the abnormal phase-dependent soleus H-reflex and flexor reflex modulation commonly observed during stepping in people with motor incomplete SCI. To test the project hypotheses, 45 people with motor incomplete SCI will be randomly assigned to receive 20 sessions of transspinal stimulation at 0.3 or 30 Hz during BWS-assisted stepping or 20 sessions of BWS-assisted stepping without transspinal stimulation (15 subjects per group). Results from this research project will advance considerably the field of spinal cord research and change the standard of care because there is great potential for development of novel and effective rehabilitation strategies to improve leg motor function after motor incomplete SCI in humans.","Inclusion criteria:

Washington University School of Medicine,OTHER,NCT04275479,Diabetes/ Endocrine Surveillance in SDS,Endocrine Diabetes Screening in Patients With Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome DIABETES/ ENDOCRINE SURVEILLANCE IN SDS,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome(SDS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder involving primarily the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome gene located on chromosome 7q11. The gene effects function of the 60S ribosome by interfering with the function of the Guanasine triphosphatase elongation factor 1 in the release of eukaryotic initiation factor 6 from the 60 S ribosomal subunit for translation initiation. Seventy five percent of the individual affected by the syndrome have a biallelic mutation (258+2T\>C and 183-184T \> CT). The syndrome results in defects primarily in the pancreas and bone marrow resulting in pancreatic insufficiency, leukopenia with an increased risk of infection and an increased risk for acute myelocytic leukemia. Animal models that have knocked out the function of the SBDS gene in the pancreas reveals at the pancreas at birth as well as the insulin producing cells in the pancreas are normal but subsequently developed fatty infiltration and apoptosis without inflammation resulting in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with initially normal endocrine pancreatic function. The endocrine pancreatic function declines over time such that by 12 months of age these mice show a phenotype of impaired glucose tolerance. The finding of early onset diabetes is not yet considered a manifestation of this genetic defect but likely is occurring. This study is designed to assist in understanding the prevalence of glucose abnormalities in this syndrome.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency leading to diabetes is a common hallmark of cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis related diabetes. Prevalence of glucose abnormalities in diabetes is a approaching 50% by the 2nd and 3rd decade of life in this disorder. The cystic fibrosis Foundation recommend screening for diabetes utilizing an oral glucose tolerance by the age of 10.

The gene effects function of the 60S ribosome by interfering with the function of the Guanasine triphosphatase elongation factor 1 in the release of eukaryotic initiation factor 6 from the 60 S ribosomal subunit for translation initiation. Seventy five percent of the individual affected by the syndrome have a biallelic mutation (258+2T\>C and 183-184T \> CT). The syndrome results in defects primarily in the pancreas and bone marrow resulting in pancreatic insufficiency, leukopenia with an increased risk of infection and an increased risk for acute myelocytic leukemia. Animal models that have knocked out the function of the SBDS gene in the pancreas reveals at the pancreas at birth as well as the insulin producing cells in the pancreas are normal but subsequently developed fatty infiltration and apoptosis without inflammation resulting in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with initially normal endocrine pancreatic function. The endocrine pancreatic function declines over time such that by 12 months of age these mice show a phenotype of impaired glucose tolerance. The finding of early onset diabetes is not yet considered a manifestation of this genetic defect but likely is occurring. This study is designed to assist in understanding the prevalence of glucose abnormalities in this syndrome. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency leading to diabetes is a common hallmark of cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis related diabetes. Prevalence of glucose abnormalities in diabetes is a approaching 50% by the 2nd and 3rd decade of life in this disorder.

University of Cologne,OTHER,NCT04732702,Effects of Contact Restrictions During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Newborns and Their Parents,"Effects of Contact Restrictions During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Newborns and Their Parents in Terms of Mother-infant Interaction, Parental Well-being, Expression and Methylation of Candidate Genes of Stress Signaling Pathways","In the study, the researchers aim to investigate the impact of contact restrictions during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on newborns and their parents. At the onset of this COVID-19 pandemic, contact restrictions in Germany were introduced on March 16th, 2020. These included, among others, the ban on visits to hospitals. This also applied to visits by fathers of newborn children. In many hospitals, fathers were allowed to accompany the mother in the delivery room for birth, but had to leave the hospital before the mother was being transferred to the ward. Fathers were not allowed to visit their wives and newborns until discharge several days later.

The hypothesis of this study is that these contact restrictions have an influence on mother-infant interaction as well as on the psychological well-being of the parents. Furthermore, the investigators postulate that these restrictions additionally have a long-term effect on neonatal stress signaling pathways. For this purpose, children are studied, who were born during the period of strict contact restrictions from March, 16th to April, 30th, 2020. The children will be assessed at about six months of age.","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, the German government decided to impose strict contact restrictions to prevent an exponential increase in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. These included visiting regulations in hospitals from March 16th, 2020. These also applied to obstetrics departments in Cologne until April 30th, 2020. At the Obstetrics University Hospital Cologne as well as at the Protestant Hospital Cologne-Weyertal, fathers were allowed to be present in the delivery room for the birth of their newborns, but had to leave the hospital again before the mothers were being transferred to the obstetrics ward. The fathers could not see their newborn again until they were discharged a few days later. The consequences of these contact restrictions on the newborns and their parents have been little studied.

In a few hospitals, there were exceptions currently to the strict contact restrictions. These included the Hospital of the Augustinian Sisters in Cologne, where no visitation bans were imposed on fathers in the obstetrics department. With general precautions fathers were still allowed to accompany their newborns and mothers in the obstetric ward. The study of the newborns of this hospital enables the researchers to see whether the parents were nevertheless affected by the general changes in the living situation during a pandemic.

The phenomenon of ""neonatal programming"", which establishes the connection between formative influences in the neonatal period (e.g. pain or stress by separation of mothers) and disorders in later life (attention deficits, lack of concentration, learning difficulties) has received increasing attention in recent years. In particular, the search for molecular mechanisms that cause such programming has been the focus of scientific projects. In a delivery-room skin-to-skin study (deisy) conducted by this research group preterm infants were randomized to skin-to-skin contact or visual contact with their mothers. Significant differences were found in both mother-infant interaction at six months of age and the expression of candidate genes of stress signaling pathway.

An important regulatory mechanism for influencing the activity of certain genes in the long term is the methylation of their promoter region. This epigenetic regulatory mechanism plays an important role, so that the modulation of DNA methylation by events in the neonatal period could be responsible for a permanent determination of a certain infant phenotype. This methylation in candidate genes in the stress signaling pathway is currently investigated by the research team in healthy mature neonates born before the onset of the pandemic, and results are pending.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of contact restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic on newborns and their parents.

Normally in healthy mother-infant-dyads without separation during the first postpartal hours, the mother has the best conditions to develop a high level of sensitivity. Sensitive maternal behavior favors the formation of optimal mother-infant interaction and is relevant for infant neurocognitive development. Due to the stressful situation caused by the separation of the father for several days, the psychological well-being of the parents as well as the optimal mother-child interaction could be negatively affected.","Inclusion Criteria:

Lack of this enzyme causes accumulation of harmful or toxic substances in the body, which leads to deterioration and failure of organs such as the brain or the heart. This disease can be fatal.

Some patients with inherited metabolic storage disease may benefit from an allogeneic stem cell transplant ('allogeneic' means that the stem cells come from another person). Stem cells are created in the bone marrow. They mature into different types of blood cells that are needed including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Stem cells, when transplanted, can make a new blood system. Donor stem cells can make the protein or enzyme patients with this disease cells cannot. The donor cells may prevent further accumulation of toxic substances. It is hoped that the donor cells can prevent or stop the disease from progressing.

This research study uses a new pre-treatment combination of two drugs, Anti-CD45 and CAMPATH-1H. Anti-CD45 and CAMPATH-1H are antibodies against certain types of blood cells. CAMPATH-1H is particularly important because it stays active in the body for a long time after infusion, which means it may work longer at preventing GVHD symptoms. In addition to antibodies, patients will receive Fludarabine, which is a chemotherapy drug. Fludarabine kills bone marrow cells and is given to reduce the bone marrow cells so that donor stem cells may 'take.'","Fludarabine will be given as a daily IV (intravenous, by vein) infusion for a total of 5 days. CAMPATH-1H will be given as a daily 4-hour IV (intravenous, by vein) infusion for three days. Anti-CD45 will be given as a daily 6-hour IV infusion over the next 4 days. Then patients will have a one-day rest period before receiving the stem cell transplant. To help prevent the body from rejecting the transplant, patients will also receive the drug FK506, starting two days before the transplant and continuing for three months. If there is no GVHD, the amount of FK506 patients are taking will be reduced by 20% every 2 weeks until this medication is stopped.","Inclusion criteria:

Donepezil is approved for treating patients with Alzheimer's disease, whose memory and cognition problems are similar to those of patients with Parkinson's disease who are affected by dementia. Donepezil prevents the breakdown of a chemical messenger called acetylcholine, which is involved in memory and other cognitive functions, and may improve cognition in patients.

Patients 40 years of age and older with Parkinson's disease who have mild to moderate dementia may be eligible for this 6-month study. It involves 6 clinic visits of approximately 2 hours each, described below. Candidates will be screened for participation during Visit 1.

* Visit 1 (screening visit): Study candidates will have a medical history, physical and neurological examinations, electrocardiogram (EKG), and possibly blood tests. They will also undergo neuropsychological testing (tests of memory, language, mood and, other brain functions) and fill out a quality of life questionnaire. Those enrolled will be randomly assigned to receive either donepezil (5 mg per day) or placebo-a look-alike pill with no active ingredients. After 4 weeks, the dose of donepezil will be increased to 10 mg per day. Patients who do not tolerate the higher dose will have it reduced to 5 mg. Those who do not tolerate the 5-mg dose will be taken off medication but will continue to be followed and tested.
* Visit 2 (week 7): Patients will have a neurological examination and neuropsychological testing and will fill out a quality of life questionnaire.
* Visit 3 (week 10): Patients will repeat the evaluations done during visit 2 and will stop taking the study medication.
* Visit 4 (week 16): Patients will repeat the evaluations done during visit 2 and will have their study medication switched. That is, patients previously on placebo will be switched to donepezil, and patients who were taking donepezil will be switched to placebo. After 4 weeks, the dose of donepezil will be increased to 10 mg per day. Patients who do not tolerate the higher dose will have it reduced to 5 mg. Those who do not tolerate the 5-mg dose will be taken off medication but will continue to be followed and tested.
* Visits 5 and 6 (weeks 23 and 26): Patients will repeat the evaluations done during visit 2.

This study is being conducted at the National Institutes of Health, the University of Pennsylvania, and Northwestern University","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dementia is a common problem late in the course of the disease and there is no effective therapy. Dementia severely impairs patients'' functional status and limits the treatment of the motor manifestations of PD. No effective therapy for dementia in PD is available. The pathophysiology of dementia in PD is not completely understood, however, as in AD, it is thought to be related to cholinergic dysfunction.

The proposed study will determine whether a therapeutic intervention with donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, shown to be effective in AD, will improve cognitive function in PD. The study is planned as a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the efficacy and safety of donepezil in PD with dementia. The study is being conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Northwestern University and NINDS.

The investigators will also evaluate the safety of NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT™ conjugate vaccine compared to the licensed vaccine. The hypothesis is that the test vaccine is comparable to the licensed active control vaccine.","Meningococcal disease is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection. The disease most commonly is expressed as either meningococcal meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, or meningococcemia, the presence of bacteria in the blood. The most common symptoms include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and rash. If not treated the disease can progress rapidly and can lead to shock and death, often within hours of the onset of symptoms. The disease is fatal at a rate of 10%. Of patients who recover, 10% have permanent hearing loss or other serious sequelae.

Neisseria meningitidis capsular polysaccharides are poor immunogens. However, conjugation of bacterial polysaccharides to immunogenic carrier proteins generally results in conjugates that induce strong anti-polysaccharide T-helper cell dependent immune responses, creating a longer-lasting immune response and thus protection against meningococcal infection.

The sponsor's small size Phase 1 clinical trial comprised 60 subjects. Therefore, additional data is needed to confirm the previous data with a statistically powered Phase 2 clinical trial. The present study aims to evaluate subject responses to single doses, administered in adult subjects, to determine further safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. This study compares safety and antibody production induced by one intramuscular injection of either NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT or a licensed meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, W-135) polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine. The primary immunogenicity endpoint will be seroresponse, based on antibody titer ≥1:8 for subjects with titer \<1:8 at baseline or a 4-fold rise in antibody levels, 4 weeks after a single injection . The number and proportion of subjects achieving seroresponse will be tabulated by serogroup for each vaccine group. A non-inferiority test will be used to determine if the immune response elicited by NmVac4 A/C/Y/W-135-DT™ is not less than a specified difference in percent seroconversion from the licensed control vaccine. Participants will attend a screening visit up to 6 weeks prior to vaccination (day 0), then will attend study visits for 4 weeks. There will be a study phone call at days 2-3, then a post-study call to subjects to assess safety at 26 weeks.","Inclusion Criteria (IC):

The investigators will also evaluate the safety of NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT™ conjugate vaccine compared to the licensed vaccine. The hypothesis is that the test vaccine is comparable to the licensed active control vaccine. Meningococcal disease is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection. The disease most commonly is expressed as either meningococcal meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, or meningococcemia, the presence of bacteria in the blood. The most common symptoms include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and rash. If not treated the disease can progress rapidly and can lead to shock and death, often within hours of the onset of symptoms. The disease is fatal at a rate of 10%. Of patients who recover, 10% have permanent hearing loss or other serious sequelae. Neisseria meningitidis capsular polysaccharides are poor immunogens. However, conjugation of bacterial polysaccharides to immunogenic carrier proteins generally results in conjugates that induce strong anti-polysaccharide T-helper cell dependent immune responses, creating a longer-lasting immune response and thus protection against meningococcal infection. The sponsor's small size Phase 1 clinical trial comprised 60 subjects. Therefore, additional data is needed to confirm the previous data with a statistically powered Phase 2 clinical trial. The present study aims to evaluate subject responses to single doses, administered in adult subjects, to determine further safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. This study compares safety and antibody production induced by one intramuscular injection of either NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT or a licensed meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, W-135) polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine. The primary immunogenicity endpoint will be seroresponse, based on antibody titer ≥1:8 for subjects with titer \<1:8 at baseline or a 4-fold rise in antibody levels, 4 weeks after a single injection . The number and proportion of subjects achieving seroresponse will be tabulated by serogroup for each vaccine group. A non-inferiority test will be used to determine if the immune response elicited by NmVac4 A/C/Y/W-135-DT™ is not less than a specified difference in percent seroconversion from the licensed control vaccine. Participants will attend a screening visit up to 6 weeks prior to vaccination (day 0), then will attend study visits for 4 weeks. There will be a study phone call at days 2-3, then a post-study call to subjects to assess safety at 26 weeks.

This program is well-suited to delivery by the city's community health workers already supporting families in improving maternal and child health outcomes. First, it will use participatory research methods to engage them and community residents in making adaptations to the community health worker's guidelines and tools for recommended activities so that they are linguistically and culturally appropriate, including guidelines for food consumption using locally available foods. These adaptations will use more graphics and photographs, so they are appropriate for low-literacy participants. Second, another key innovation is the explicit orientation to couples, where only one may have a diagnosed cardiovascular disease. This adaptation will provide tools the women can use in negotiating for changes to the family's meals and her daily routine. Third, investigators will conduct a comparative effectiveness study at 6 community health centers with high rates of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), recruiting adults recently diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension. Based on the random allocation of their community health center, participants will be assigned to one of three groups of 150 each: Couples, with at least one meeting the eligibility criteria; Individuals, men and women, both eligible; Comparison, men and women with CVD. Trained community health workers and diabetic peer educators will use the adapted Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) materials with the Couples and Individuals groups over a period of 6 months. At the conclusion of this pilot investigators will assess the levels of adoption of recommended cardiovascular risk reduction behaviors and changes in obesity, hypertension, and diabetes control, comparing differences in outcomes between the three groups. It will enable Mali to incorporate diabetes and hypertension risk reduction into their already deployed networks of community health workers. The Malian DPP adaptation will also be suitable for Francophone West Africa, where customs and lifestyles are similar among the millions of families confronting the burdens of cardiovascular disease.","Specific Aims:

Aim 1 will adapt the diet and lifestyle change modalities of the Small Steps, Big Rewards (SSBR) recommendations to the cultural and economic realities affecting women's choices in Bamako. As in other cross-national adaptations of the DPP, investigators will translate the food and exercise recommendations into equivalent recommendations using locally available foods and exercise opportunities. Study partners have already estimated the caloric and glycemic indices of the most common foods prepared in Mali, and the demonstrations and recommendations will be based on these estimations. Cultural and gender-sensitive recommendations for exercise will be similarly tailored to the urban African context, with participating women from the low-income communities ensuring the cultural appropriateness of these adaptations.

Aim 2 will develop culturally and gender-specific communication strategies for empowering low- income, low-literacy women to apply the SSBR recommendations for themselves and their families. Investigators will incorporate the tools and demonstrations for SSBR developed in Aim 1 to the refinement of the Malian adaptation SSBR-Mali group sessions. An effective approach to chronic disease management in Africa has promoted sharing adherence messages among couples, so they can better support each other in staying adherent. The preliminary work also highlights the need to explore alternative methods to help women gain the approval and support of their spouses and other family members.

Aim 3 is to assess the effectiveness of the Malian adaptation of the DPP to increase adoption of diabetes prevention practices and reduce hyperglycemia and hypertension among couples enrolling in the program, compared to those participating as individuals. Using the adaptation developed in Aim 2 the investigators will compare the effectiveness of the Malian adaptation of the SSBR in selected community health centers in peripheral low-income communities with high rates of diabetes or hypertension. Trained CHWs and diabetic peer educators will implement the program for 6 months, with assessments conducted to compare changes pre-post participation in healthy behaviors and diabetes and hypertension management outcomes with 450 participants in the intervention at 4 community health centers versus 150 comparable individuals at 2 control community centers. The analysis will focus on the comparison of effectiveness for individuals enrolled as couples where at least one has CVD versus those enrolled as individuals with CVD.

Research Plan

A. Innovation

The couple-orientation to this DPP is innovative, as all previous DPP adaptations focus on individual participants. By enrolling both members of a couple where only one of them may have diabetes or hypertension, they will both participate in group sessions and learn how they can support each other to make changes. Carefully crafted role plays will provide women with the communication tools for negotiating changes to family meals or daily activities. The adaptation will be the first which recognizes the need for materials to be appropriate for low-literacy participants, with greater use of locally prepared photographic and graphic content for group sessions, the CHW flip-chart and participant food and activity tracker materials. The participatory approach to developing the pilot study will further strengthen the skills of the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako (USTTB) researchers toward shifting their research out of the clinics and into the neighborhoods, enabling them to better partner with the health ministry as they move in the direction of prevention and community-based health services.

B. Approach

1. Study Site: Mali has noncommunicable diseases mortality rates among the highest in the world and higher for women than men. In 2019, the number of adults with diabetes was estimated at 157,600 adults, with only 50,000 aware of their diabetes. Bamako, the capital city with over 2 million residents, has the highest obesity and cardiovascular disease rates. Over one in ten urban adults are diabetic, and one in four hypertensive. Between 2002 and 2013 obesity among city residents aged 15-65 rose from 10% to 16%, with obesity rates five times higher for women than men. The rates of obesity and malnutrition (low diet diversity) were higher among the less educated and in low-income, peripheral neighborhoods. Therefore, this pilot study will focus on the low-income peripheral neighborhoods of Communes I and IV, where the investigators will select the six Community Health Centers (CSCOM), Mali's primary health care centers, with the highest numbers of diabetes and hypertension diagnoses in the previous two years. Four will be randomly selected to participate in the pilot, while two will serve as comparison sites.
2. Research Strategy The adaptation of the DPP SSBR program will adhere to the principles of the trans-theoretical model for facilitating behavioral change to resistant behaviors. The group lifestyle behavior approach of the DPP program is already based on the principles of the trans-theoretical change model, with the sessions helping people move quickly from pre-contemplation to contemplation (Sessions 1 and 2), preparation (Sessions 3-6), with adoption the focus of sessions 4-9, and maintenance the focus of sessions 10-12. The role plays, demonstrations, and discussions are designed to build the confidence of women to introduce healthy eating and lifestyles to their husbands and other women in their household. To ensure that the tools and activities are appropriate for the Bamako context, participatory research methods will be used, inviting 30 community residents (12 women, 12 men and 6 CHWs) from the a CSCOM to participate in the adaptation process.

To make the sessions more culturally appropriate, including the importance of involving the other women in the household in food and cooking decisions, the investigators have added sessions on how to share the responsibility for a healthy lifestyle with the other women in the household, as well as how to gain the support of the household head and other family and friends. The sessions on eating out and reading labels have been modified to be appropriate for the types of street food and market products available in Bamako. The sessions on caloric balance have been converted to the balance in the number of portions, with an emphasis on measuring portions and ingredients used in cooking. Role plays, demonstrations, and videos of exercises have been included, complementing the group discussions already included in the DPP group approach format. With these additions the number of sessions is 15, similar to that used in other group lifestyle adaptations of the DPP Power to Prevent. The training tools were pre-tested with the community health workers of a CSCOM in Bamako, and then finalized during the training of the community health workers who will deliver the program.

After the SSBR-M sessions and tools are developed, a pilot study will be conducted to assess the potential contribution that participation might make to changes in recommended behaviors of the participants and their spouses, as well as to their level of blood sugar, blood pressure, BMI and waist circumference.","Inclusion Criteria:

Third, investigators will conduct a comparative effectiveness study at 6 community health centers with high rates of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), recruiting adults recently diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension. Based on the random allocation of their community health center, participants will be assigned to one of three groups of 150 each: Couples, with at least one meeting the eligibility criteria; Individuals, men and women, both eligible; Comparison, men and women with CVD. Trained community health workers and diabetic peer educators will use the adapted Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) materials with the Couples and Individuals groups over a period of 6 months. At the conclusion of this pilot investigators will assess the levels of adoption of recommended cardiovascular risk reduction behaviors and changes in obesity, hypertension, and diabetes control, comparing differences in outcomes between the three groups. It will enable Mali to incorporate diabetes and hypertension risk reduction into their already deployed networks of community health workers. The Malian DPP adaptation will also be suitable for Francophone West Africa, where customs and lifestyles are similar among the millions of families confronting the burdens of cardiovascular disease. Specific Aims: Aim 1 will adapt the diet and lifestyle change modalities of the Small Steps, Big Rewards (SSBR) recommendations to the cultural and economic realities affecting women's choices in Bamako. As in other cross-national adaptations of the DPP, investigators will translate the food and exercise recommendations into equivalent recommendations using locally available foods and exercise opportunities. Study partners have already estimated the caloric and glycemic indices of the most common foods prepared in Mali, and the demonstrations and recommendations will be based on these estimations. Cultural and gender-sensitive recommendations for exercise will be similarly tailored to the urban African context, with participating women from the low-income communities ensuring the cultural appropriateness of these adaptations. Aim 2 will develop culturally and gender-specific communication strategies for empowering low- income, low-literacy women to apply the SSBR recommendations for themselves and their families. Investigators will incorporate the tools and demonstrations for SSBR developed in Aim 1 to the refinement of the Malian adaptation SSBR-Mali group sessions. An effective approach to chronic disease management in Africa has promoted sharing adherence messages among couples, so they can better support each other in staying adherent. The preliminary work also highlights the need to explore alternative methods to help women gain the approval and support of their spouses and other family members. Aim 3 is to assess the effectiveness of the Malian adaptation of the DPP to increase adoption of diabetes prevention practices and reduce hyperglycemia and hypertension among couples enrolling in the program, compared to those participating as individuals. Using the adaptation developed in Aim 2 the investigators will compare the effectiveness of the Malian adaptation of the SSBR in selected community health centers in peripheral low-income communities with high rates of diabetes or hypertension. Trained CHWs and diabetic peer educators will implement the program for 6 months, with assessments conducted to compare changes pre-post participation in healthy behaviors and diabetes and hypertension management outcomes with 450 participants in the intervention at 4 community health centers versus 150 comparable individuals at 2 control community centers. The analysis will focus on the comparison of effectiveness for individuals enrolled as couples where at least one has CVD versus those enrolled as individuals with CVD. Research Plan A. Innovation The couple-orientation to this DPP is innovative, as all previous DPP adaptations focus on individual participants. By enrolling both members of a couple where only one of them may have diabetes or hypertension, they will both participate in group sessions and learn how they can support each other to make changes. Carefully crafted role plays will provide women with the communication tools for negotiating changes to family meals or daily activities. The adaptation will be the first which recognizes the need for materials to be appropriate for low-literacy participants, with greater use of locally prepared photographic and graphic content for group sessions, the CHW flip-chart and participant food and activity tracker materials. The participatory approach to developing the pilot study will further strengthen the skills of the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako (USTTB) researchers toward shifting their research out of the clinics and into the neighborhoods, enabling them to better partner with the health ministry as they move in the direction of prevention and community-based health services. B. Approach 1. Study Site: Mali has noncommunicable diseases mortality rates among the highest in the world and higher for women than men. In 2019, the number of adults with diabetes was estimated at 157,600 adults, with only 50,000 aware of their diabetes. Bamako, the capital city with over 2 million residents, has the highest obesity and cardiovascular disease rates. Over one in ten urban adults are diabetic, and one in four hypertensive. Between 2002 and 2013 obesity among city residents aged 15-65 rose from 10% to 16%, with obesity rates five times higher for women than men. The rates of obesity and malnutrition (low diet diversity) were higher among the less educated and in low-income, peripheral neighborhoods. Therefore, this pilot study will focus on the low-income peripheral neighborhoods of Communes I and IV, where the investigators will select the six Community Health Centers (CSCOM), Mali's primary health care centers, with the highest numbers of diabetes and hypertension diagnoses in the previous two years. Four will be randomly selected to participate in the pilot, while two will serve as comparison sites. 2. Research Strategy The adaptation of the DPP SSBR program will adhere to the principles of the trans-theoretical model for facilitating behavioral change to resistant behaviors. The group lifestyle behavior approach of the DPP program is already based on the principles of the trans-theoretical change model, with the sessions helping people move quickly from pre-contemplation to contemplation (Sessions 1 and 2), preparation (Sessions 3-6), with adoption the focus of sessions 4-9, and maintenance the focus of sessions 10-12. The role plays, demonstrations, and discussions are designed to build the confidence of women to introduce healthy eating and lifestyles to their husbands and other women in their household. To ensure that the tools and activities are appropriate for the Bamako context, participatory research methods will be used, inviting 30 community residents (12 women, 12 men and 6 CHWs) from the a CSCOM to participate in the adaptation process. To make the sessions more culturally appropriate, including the importance of involving the other women in the household in food and cooking decisions, the investigators have added sessions on how to share the responsibility for a healthy lifestyle with the other women in the household, as well as how to gain the support of the household head and other family and friends. The sessions on eating out and reading labels have been modified to be appropriate for the types of street food and market products available in Bamako. The sessions on caloric balance have been converted to the balance in the number of portions, with an emphasis on measuring portions and ingredients used in cooking. Role plays, demonstrations, and videos of exercises have been included, complementing the group discussions already included in the DPP group approach format. With these additions the number of sessions is 15, similar to that used in other group lifestyle adaptations of the DPP Power to Prevent. The training tools were pre-tested with the community health workers of a CSCOM in Bamako, and then finalized during the training of the community health workers who will deliver the program. After the SSBR-M sessions and tools are developed, a pilot study will be conducted to assess the potential contribution that participation might make to changes in recommended behaviors of the participants and their spouses, as well as to their level of blood sugar, blood pressure, BMI and waist circumference.

Necmettin Erbakan University,OTHER,NCT05640284,Evaluation of the Effect of Periimplant Soft Tissue Phenotype on Marginal Bone Loss,Evaluation of the Effect of Periimplant Soft Tissue Phenotype on Marginal Bone Loss Using Biochemical Approach,"The goal of this clinical trial to test the effect of periimplant soft tissue phenotype in the participants with implant placed and at least 1 year after implant loading. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Is keratinized mucosal thickness (KMT) important in early marginal bone loss and peri implant health?
2. Is keratinized gingival width (KGW) important in early marginal bone loss and and peri implant health? The researchers plan to include 80 implants in the study. These 80 implants will be divided into 2 groups in 2 different ways according to their KMT and KGW on their buccal surfaces: KMT ≥2 mm are included in the adequate KMT, and those with KMT\<2 mm are in the insufficient KMT group. Those with KGW≥2 mm are adequate KGW, those with KGW\<2 mm are adequate KGW. The researchers will assess marginal bone loss around the implant using radiographs and collect peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) using paper strips. Another researchers will measure the Receptor Activator Of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B Ligand (RANKL), Osteoprotegerin (OPG), Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α), MicroRNA-223 (MiRNA-223), MicroRNA-27a (MiRNA-27a) levels in the collected PICF. They will compare radiographic bone loss and biomarker levels in groups.","Early marginal bone loss around the implant can be caused by various reasons. Keratinized mucosal thickness (KMT) and keratinized gingival width (KGW) are components of periimplant soft tissue. Recently, KGW and KMT in the peri-implant region have been investigated as possible factors influencing this phenomenon.

The hypothesis of this study: Periimplant soft tissue phenotype is associated with marginal bone loss and peri implant health through Receptor Activator Of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B Ligand (RANKL), Osteoprotegerin (OPG), Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α), MicroRNA-223 (MiRNA-223) and Microrna-27a 80 implants, at least 1 year after their loading, in patients who continued their routine controls will be included in the study. The participants in this study were selected from patients who underwent implant placement by the same periodontologist (E.Ö.) in the Department of Periodontology of Necmettin Erbakan University in 2020 and still have 6-month radiographic and clinical follow-up. Selected patients, those who signed the written informed consent form were included in the study. In the study, the first radiographs of all patients, the clinical and radiographic conditions obtained at the 6-month routine control examination will be evaluated. During the same routine controls, a sample of peri-implant groove fluid was taken with paper strips.

Diagnoses of the implants included in the study will be made using the criteria of the 2017 World Workshop on Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions. 2 mm marginal bone loss (MBL) which may occur during the bone remodeling process after implant placement and loading, is accepted as the threshold. The absence of signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, bleeding on probing) in the peri-implant soft tissue, probing depth (PD) ≤5 mm with mild force (approximately 0.25 N), and no further bone loss following initial healing are defined as ""periimplant health"". ""Peri-implant mucositis"" is defined as clinically observable signs of inflammation (swelling, redness and soft consistency of tissue), bleeding on probing (BOP) (lines or drops) and/or signs of suppuration in the absence of bone loss greater than 2 mm, the threshold for initial bone remodulation defined. The definition of ""peri-implantitis"" is clinically observable signs of inflammation, probing bleeding and/or suppuration, increased probing depth, progressive bone loss after implant restoration, or MBL ≥3 mm with profuse bleeding in the absence of initial radiographs and PD was ≥6 mm. Implants with periimplantitis will be excluded. Implants will be divided into 2 groups according to their peri-implant health: Peri-implant health and peri-implant mucositis.

In addition to routine clinical and radiographic examination of the implants, KMT and KGW measurements will be made. they will be divided into 2 groups in 2 ways. According to KMT on their buccal surfaces: KMT ≥2 mm are included in the adequate KMT, and those with KMT \<2 mm are in the inadequate KMT group (60). According to KGW on their buccal surfaces: KGW≥2 mm are adequate KGW, those with KGW\<2 mm are inadequate KGW.

Radiographic evaluation will be made using intraoral periapical radiographs obtained using the parallel technique with the plastic film holder. Calibration of digital images will be performed using the length of the implant as a well-defined fixed reference point. The bone level measurement will be made by measuring between the bone-implant first contact point and the reference point in the coronal part of the implant body selected for different implant systems in both the mesial and distal directions of the implants. In order to evaluate the marginal bone loss (MBL), the measurements obtained will be compared with the measurements on the radiographs taken after the delivery of the prosthesis.

Peri-implant crevicular fluid (PIGF) will be collected from the participants for the biochemical evaluation to be made. PIGF specimens will be collected from the mesiobuccal of each implant, prior to any periodontal probing, and after removal of the supra mucosal plate. The area to be sampled will be insulated with cotton rolls and air-dried. The paper will be advanced with the strip until it shows slight resistance and held in the sample area for 30 seconds. Samples will be stored at -70˚C.

TNF-α, RANKL, OPG and MiRNA 223 and MiRNA 27a evaluations of the peri-implant crevicular fluid (PIGF) collected from the patients will be performed. TNF-α, RANKL and OPG will be evaluated by the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) method.

Up to 207 healthy nearsighted or farsighted patients with minimal or no astigmatism and no contraindications to CW lens use will be followed for 1 year. The primary outcome measure is the time to development of a corneal inflammatory event (CIE) as defined by slit lamp findings and patient symptoms. The main exposure of interest is corneal staining. Other key exploratory variables include bacterial contamination of study lenses and inflammatory mediators found in the tear film. Inclusion Criteria: 1. The patient must be at least 15 years old. Children younger than this may not be mature enough for CW, and may have difficulty following the strict instructions required for CW or sitting through the exam procedures. 2. The patient must have clear central corneas and free of any anterior segment disorders. 3. The patient must have a spectacle corrected spherical refractive error between +5.50 D and -11.00 D with less than or equal to 1.00 D refractive cylinder. The parameters of the Ciba Vision Night and Day Lenses range from +6.00 to -10.00 D, and can correct the refractive range of this population. Monovision correction will be allowed only if the near eye does not exceed +6.00 D. 4. The patient must be correctable to 20/25 or better with spectacles. Amblyopia will be excluded. 5. Flat and steep corneal curvatures from SimK readings must be between 39.00 and 48.00 D. Corneal curvatures outside this range may be indicative of a disease state, and patients are not expected to comfortably wear either the 8.4 mm or 8.6 mm base curve available in Night and Day.(Dumbleton K 2002) 6.

The patient has worn rigid gas permeable lenses within the last 30 days or PMMA lenses within the last 3 months. These lenses can transiently alter the corneal shape and influence the fitting of soft lenses. 2. The patient must not be a current extended wear user of lotrafilcon A lenses. 3. The patient has an autoimmune disease (except for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis), immunocompromising disease, connective tissue disease, atopic dermatitis, insulin dependent diabetes, or any other systemic disease that in the investigator's opinion will affect ocular health. 4. The patient is taking chronic systemic medications such as corticosteroids, antimetabolites, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or any other medication that in the investigator's opinion will affect ocular physiology. 5. The patient has any ocular disease or condition such as aphakia, corneal dystrophies, corneal edema, external ocular infection, iritis, or had any anterior segment surgery. 6. The patient is taking any ocular medications. 7. The patient must have less than or equal to grade 2 on any of the slit lamp observations of: upper tarsal papilla, corneal staining, corneal neovascularization, conjunctival injection, and lid erythema or scales.

University Hospital Heidelberg,OTHER,NCT01568502,Dobutamine Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Versus Echocardiography for the Assessment of Outcome. Are the Two Imaging Modalities Comparable?,,"Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (DCMR) are both established non-invasive techniques, used in the clinical routine for the diagnostic classification and risk stratification of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD).

In this regard, regional wall motion abnormalities (WMA) during dobutamine stress, precede the development of ST-segment depression and anginal symptoms, enabling the detection of anatomically significant CAD and the assessment of clinical outcomes.

In a head-to-head comparison between the 2 techniques, favourable diagnostic characteristics in terms of higher sensitivity and accuracy were noted for DCMR compared to DSE.

Although it has been reported that stress induced WMA both in DCMR and in DSE are independent predictors for hard cardiac events such as cardiac death or myocardial infarction, the value of the 2 techniques for the risk stratification of patients with CAD has not been compared to each other so far.

Comparison of these 2 non-invasive techniques is important, because referring physicians need to know which modality is more reliable for the identification of patients at higher risk for subsequent cardiac events, who would benefit from early invasive therapy.

In the investigators study the investigators therefore sought to compare the ability of DSE versus DCMR to predict subsequent hard cardiac events and revascularization procedures in a patient cohort with high CAD prevalence. Their predictive value was compared to that of conventional atherogenic risk factors and to resting WMA. In addition, the investigators sought to determine if both techniques are equally suitable for structuring invasive or conservative treatment according to the presence or absence of inducible ischemia, respectively.","Background: Both DSE and DCMR are implemented in the daily diagnostic work-up of patients with ischemic heart disease. Although DCMR was previously shown to aid the diagnostic classification of patients with suspected CAD with higher sensitivity and accuracy compared to that provided by DSE, the value of the 2 techniques for the risk stratification of patients with CAD has not been investigated so far.

Methods: Patients with suspected or known CAD underwent either DSE or DCMR for clinical reasons using the same standardised high-dose dobutamine/atropine protocol.

Blood draws will be performed on Day 1 in a 10-12 hr fasted state and 2 hour postprandial state and again on Day 3 in a 36hr fasted state and a 2 hour post prandial state. Microbiome samples and blood glucose data will be collected throughout the course of the study.,"Screening and Consent:

Prospective subjects who pass the initial phone screening interview (i.e. meet inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be admitted into the study and scheduled for a consent visit. At the consent visit, subjects who decide to participate will be given a series of questionnaires including a health history questionnaire, physical activity questionnaire, and will be asked to complete a 3-day diet record, to be completed before the baseline visit at the beginning of the study. Women who consent to participate will be scheduled to complete the study within the follicular phase and menses of the menstrual cycle to avoid confounding alterations in lipoproteins.

Study Visit1 (Baseline fasted):

On Day 1 of the study protocolstudy participants will report to the Ragle Human Nutrition Research Center located on the UC Davis campus (1283 Academic Surge, University of California, Davis, in Davis CA 95616) for a 12-hour overnight fasting blood draw and anthropometric measurements at approximately 8AM. Any participants that are found to have fasting glucose above or below 70-100mg/dL will be removed from the study. Study participants will be given a Precision Xtra Blood Ketone Testing Kit to collect blood ketone data during the fasting period of the study protocol, a set of stool collection kits to collect stool samples throughout the rest of the study protocoland fitted with a GoBe activity monitor to track physical activity throughout the rest of the study protocol. Proper use, care, and storage of the Precision Xtra systems, stool collection kits, and GoBe monitors will be explained in detail to study participants during the baseline visit. Study participants will be given a 24-hr food diary to record their food and beverage intake throughout the rest of the day or may be asked to track their diet using GB 360.

Study Visit 2 (Baseline postprandial):

After the baseline visit on Day 1 of the study protocol, study participants will go about their normal routines and eat their habitual diet ad libitum while recording their dietary intake throughout the day. This food record will be used in order for the study participants to mimic their food intake on Day 1 during the eating period on Day 3 of the study protocol. Study participants will eat their last meal of the day at approximately 6PM. Post-prandial blood samples will be collected at 2 hours after the ingestion of this last meal and immediately processed to yield patient plasma and isolated PBMCs to be stored for future analysis. These post-prandial samples will constitute the baseline ""Fed"" state of each participant. Study participants will also perform their first bloodprick for ketone measurement using the Precision Xtra Monitor under instruction and supervision by study personnel.

Fasting:

After ingestion of their final meal, participants will undergo a full 36 hours of fasting comprising Day 2 and the beginning of Day 3 of the trial without otherwise modifying their typical routine, including drinking coffee or tea (but with no creamers or sweeteners of any kind), if this is part of their normal routine. The time of the ingestion of the standardized meal will be used as the start point (0hr) for the continuous 36 hours of fasting. 36 hrs of fasting has been shown to be well tolerated in human subjects and was chosen for this trial as it represents the approximate amount of time that fasting would be experienced during a single cycle of an alternate day fasting regimen. Therefore, results from this study could be generalized to plan for future studies of alternate day fasting. Subjects will be encouraged to report any feelings of dizziness, headaches, nausea, or severe hunger that they may experience and, based on the severity of their conditions, will be advised whether or not to continue with the trial. Subjects will be asked to take small blood pricks starting immediately after waking up on Day 2 and then every 3 conscious hours thereafter using thePrecision Xtra Blood Ketone Testing Kits in order to test blood ketone levels during the fasting period. Ketone levels obtained from the blood pricks will be recorded automatically by the Precision Xtra monitor.

Study Visit 3 (Post 36h fasted):

At 36 hours of fasting, roughly 8AM on Day 3, subjects will return to the Ragle Center, perform a final blood prick for ketone monitoring by the Precision Xtra and their blood samples will be collected and again immediately processed and stored for future analysis constituting the ""Fasted"" state for each participant.

Study Visit 4 (Post 36h postprandial):

After the blooddraw at Study Visit 3, study participants will be allowed free access to food throughout the rest of the day and asked to eat an identical diet to the dietary intake the participants recorded on Day 1 in their 24 hour food diary. Subjects will eat their last meal at approximately 6PM. Post-prandial blood samples will be collected at 2 hours after the ingestion of this last meal and immediately processed to yield patient plasma and isolated PBMCs to be stored for future analysis. These post-prandial samples will constitute the ""Refed"" state of each participant. After this final blood draw, the Precision Xtra system will be collected, the GoBe removed, and the activity and ketone data collected throughout the course of the study will be transferred to a secure computer for analysis. Fasting compliance will be determined as 1) increasing or steady ketone levels throughout the 36hr fasting period and 2) the absence of significant drops in blood ketone levels, which would indicate food intake and noncompliance.

StoolCollection (Days 1-3):

Boston Medical Center,OTHER,NCT02845102,Treating Comorbid Depression During Care Transitions Using Relational Agents,Treating Comorbid Depression During Care Transitions Using Relational Agents,"Depression is common among individuals with chronic illness such as chronic heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is a strong predictor of poor clinical outcomes and high rates of avoidable 30-day readmissions. While depression is a treatable condition, few people with depression receive effective treatment. The proposed study aims to develop a relational agent system to deliver depression treatment to patients with chronic illness and comorbid depression. While depression is a treatable condition, less than 36% of people with depression receive effective treatment. The proposed study aims to design and develop a technology-driven relational agent system to deliver a 6 module, blended approach of cognitive behavioral therapy and self-management education (RA-CBT) to support patients with CHF or COPD and comorbid depression. The relational agent is a human animation program that interacts with patients, integrates best practices from provider-patient communication theory, emulating the face-to-face conversational behavior of an empathic provider emphasizing nonverbal communicative behavior such as gaze, posture, gestures, etc. The RA-CBT program will be accessed via tablet technology by participants. The study investigators will conduct a pre-post feasibility study to understand the feasibility and acceptability of using the RA-CBT system and its effectiveness in treating comorbid depression. If successful, this new approach to depression treatment would immediately expand access and scalability for post-discharge mental health support in the care transition.","Depression is a treatable disorder with effective pharmacologic and psychotherapy options for treatment. Evidence suggests that psychotherapy interventions such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and self-management education (Lorig) can improve depression, physical symptoms and quality of life in patients with chronic medical conditions.While depression is treatable, less than 36% of patients afflicted with mood disorders get treatment. In order to meet the imminent need for post-discharge mental health support for patients with chronic illness, innovative approaches to delivering mental healthcare that are accessible on short notice, are urgently needed. The study investigators now aim to translate the RED-D intervention to an automated system to expand immediate access and scalability for this support service.

Cognitive behavioral therapy for depression (CBT) and self-management education have been studied for the treatment of comorbid depression in chronically ill patients. CBT is a psychosocial intervention that posits that depressive symptoms occur when individuals have a dysfunctional view of themselves, the world and the future. CBT teaches techniques to examine dysfunctional beliefs that perpetuate depression and to develop more accurate and helpful ones to alleviate that condition. It has largely been documented that CBT is among the most effective treatments for depression and shown to be more effective than other psychosocial treatments, as effective as pharmacotherapy and as effective as adding another medication for patients who do not respond to one antidepressant alone. CBT has also been successfully used to treat comorbid depression; the ENRICHD trial demonstrated that a collaborative care approach, hinged on CBT, is an effective treatment for depressive symptoms among post MI patients and superior to usual care.

Several studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of self-management education. For example, Lorig et al showed that self-management education enhances self-efficacy and reduces health service utilization among patients with chronic illness. This and similar programs include key processes of identifying and addressing problems, problem solving skills training, action plan design, and applying skills to medical and psychosocial aspects of chronic illness. However, self-management education alone shows limited efficacy for chronically ill patients with significant depression.

A few interventions have combined CBT for depression with self-management support. Culley et al showed that a brief CBT intervention integrating self-management strategies reduced both depressive and dyspnea symptoms in a trial with veterans diagnosed with either CHF or COPD in a primary care setting. This evidence suggests a blended and brief skills-based approach to treatment that addresses both physical symptoms and depression is more effective for depressed patients with chronically illness. However, conventional CBT has limitations. Traditionally, CBT is delivered in a face-to-face format requiring a patient to meet with a therapist in an office setting for weekly sessions for 1 weeks or more. Adherence can be a barrier for CBT due to factors related to stigma, transportation, or access to trained CBT clinicians. This has led to trials of alternative formats for delivering CBT including both telephone delivered CBT and computer-based CBT (cCBT), both of which are shown to increase adherence to treatment compared with face-to-face CBT.

Many cCBT models are in use today because of their numerous technological advantages including cost effectiveness, increased access and flexibility, and also reduced stigma for those seeking treatment for mental health conditions. cCBT is also shown to be effective for people over the age of 50, suggesting that cCBT is feasible with older patients. However, there are still several limitations to cCBT that can impact efficacy. For example, current cCBT systems largely rely on textbased interactions, creating a potential literacy barrier for some users. Similar to face-to-face CBT, nonadherence is also a problem for cCBT. Sustained adherence is essential to reach a successful therapeutic outcome with cCBT. Yet, despite their promise, evidence shows that outside of clinical trial conditions, many cCBT users do not complete the intervention, thus adherence is still a problem, although cCBT systems with embedded adherence support messages such as weekly reminders have demonstrated higher rates of program completion.

The study investigators propose to automate delivery of AHRQ's RED-D intervention and extend it with integrated self-management education for patients with CHF or COPD and comorbid depression following hospitalization. This intervention will be delivered using Relational Agent (RA) technology. Relational agents are animated counselors that provide patients with virtual consultations by simulating face-to-face conversation with an empathic provider. RAs provide an ideal medium for the CBT intervention because of: 1) their demonstrated ability to address non-adherence; 2) empathic communication features; 3) the ability to tailor the intervention to the individual patient; 4) the study investigators' past work demonstrating that hospitalized patients with depressive symptoms report high acceptance of the RA; and 5) the potential to address mental healthcare access barriers. Similar efforts using RA technology are being explored by the US Department of Defense to address the burden of PTSD among war veterans.

Traditional CBT has been effective for medically ill patients but limited in its impact on physical symptom experiences and therefore quality of life and healthcare utilization. Cully et al have shown a brief, face-to-face CBT intervention integrating self-management education is more effective for medically ill patients in primary care for reducing depression symptoms and improving quality of life. The relational agent CBT (RA-CBT) system will include six modules tailored for chronically ill patients with comorbid depression, including key components of face-to-face CBT. The final session will include a follow up exit interview to understand the patinet participant's experience with the RA-CBT program and to evaluate the effectiveness of the RA-CBT agent. The final session will incorporate a quantitative questionnaire and a voluntary qualitative interview. The RA-CBT program will include the following topics: cognitive restructuring (identify behaviors, emotions, and thoughts associated with chronic disease and depression, evaluate them and identify more helpful ones), problem solving, behavioral activation, adherence with medical appointments and medication management, and disease self-management. The disease self-management module will address relaxation, sleep hygiene and physical symptom management. Each module will contain a homework component. The RA-CBT protocol will be empathic, reflective and interactive, enhancing the possibility to develop engagement, increase adherence, and establish a trusting relationship and therapeutic alliance. Whereas current cCBT users cannot ask questions, the study team's RA-CBT intervention will make use of psychosocial technology that will allow the RA to interact with and respond to questions that arise.

Drs. Bickmore, Jack and Mitchell have conducted a series of studies using RA technology for health education and behavior change, including inpatient education (AHRQ grant 1R18HS017196-01 and AHRQ RFTO ""Communication- Focused Technologies"") and counseling for patients of all levels of health literacy. Dr. Bickmore and his team at Northeastern University have extensive experience designing and implementing RA psychosocial technology that simulates face-to-face conversation that is sensitive to the qualities of CBT that help establish an empathetic relationship, honing the use of social interaction with conversational technology in order to build trust and a therapeutic alliance between the agent and patient. There are many reasons why RAs provide an effective medium for health communication with patients, especially those with limited health literacy. The human-computer interface relies minimally on text (as compared to current cCBT models) and uses the universally understood format of face-to-face conversation, making it accessible to patients with limited reading ability. Most importantly, RAs enhance recall of critical information through the use of nonverbal conversational behaviors (gesture, tone) by providing redundant channels for conveying semantic content in order to enhance the likelihood of message comprehension. In addition, all cultures have nonverbal means for marking emphasis (for example, eyebrow raising and 'beat' or 'baton' hand gestures in American English) that may highlight salient parts of a message. Unlike a pre-recorded video lecture, the study team's RA-CBT intervention provides a flexible and dynamic communication medium that relies on synthetic speech tailored to the patient and the discourse context using language dynamically assembled using a dialogue engine (i.e. use of the patient's name, medical record information, and other personally relevant information) that responds to the context of the conversation (i.e. the questions asked, patient responses during earlier sessions, etc.) Patient contributions to the dialogue are made by selecting what they want to say from a multiple choice menu, dynamically updated for each turn of the conversation (no natural language understanding of unconstrained text or speech is performed). Alternative technologies do not offer this adaptive, face-to-face encounter that accommodates patients' needs. This interface has been used by over 2,500 patients including many with no prior computer experience.","Inclusion Criteria:

Aga Khan University,OTHER,NCT01229579,Effect of Zinc Supplementation on Response to Oral Polio Vaccine in Infants in Pakistan,"Effect of Zinc Supplementation on Response to Oral Polio Vaccine in Infants in Pakistan: a Randomized, Controlled Trial","Pakistan is one of the 4 developing countries where cases of poliomyelitis are still being identified. Despite the incessant efforts by WHO and UNICEF, this disease is far from control. There is a need to develop new and innovative strategies to contain the disease and eradicate it from the countries where new cases continue to be identified.

Zinc is an essential component of scores of enzymes in the human body. Recent reports have indicated that this trace element along with other micronutrients enhances the protective functions of immune cells. Moreover, zinc deficiency leads to dysregulation of balanced host responses to infection resulting into decreased antibody production and suppressed immunity. Zinc is also an essential cofactor for thymulin which is known to modulate cytokine release and induce immune cell proliferation. Zinc deficiency is also found to impair an individual's epithelial barrier function, which may further depress the vaccine entry into the mucosal cells.

Role of zinc in the prevention of diarrheal diseases and other infections in children is well documented. However, there are very few reports about its contribution to enhanced immunity by supporting body's natural defense system.

Zinc insufficiency is widespread in socioeconomically deprived children in South Asia and the recent most national nutrition survey (2003) . Moreover, diarrhea is also very common in infants in Pakistan. Such diarrheal episodes can limit entry of attenuated polio virus into the mucosal cells, thereby, leading to inadequate immune response. Association between recent diarrheal history and increased vaccine failure in infants has been shown in a study from Brazil. The recent Lancet Nutrition series has also recommended regular zinc supplementation to address child undernutrition and stunting and underscored the need to treat diarrheal episodes with zinc to expedite recovery. Other recent studies of zinc supplementation in low birth weight infants in South Asia have also shown significant improvement in diarrheal disease burden and mortality.

On the basis of these lines of evidence, it is possible that some of the cases of vaccine failure in this region could be a consequence of compromised immunity and, hence, diminished response to OPV. This could potentially be reversed by addressing such gross undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. It can thus be hypothesized that zinc supplementation at community scale would enhance the immune response in infants to OPV.

In order to test this research question, the investigators propose to undertake 12-month randomized controlled trial among a cohort of Pakistani infants of 0-14 days of age. Such a trial would enable us to understand the synergistic role of zinc (if any) with OPV in enhancing immune response against polio and sero-conversion rates.","The investigators propose to carry out a randomized controlled clinical trial in Pakistan to assess the efficacy of zinc supplementation in the first 18 weeks of life on seroconversion due to OPV.

Infants of 0-14 days of age will be recruited and randomized into 2 groups; all the groups would receive the respective OPV doses according to the EPI schedule, and the intervention group, in addition, would receive 10 mg of elemental zinc on a daily basis, for 18 weeks, starting at the age of 14 days.

At 18 weeks (after the 4 weeks of last OPV), the investigators provide an additional dose of bOPV as a challenge and collect stool samples to at 0 and 7 days after delivery at of the bOPV.

Study settings The rural settlement of Hala (population \~ 200,000), located about 200 km north-east of Karachi, Pakistan would be the selected study site, as a high proportion of at-risk under 5 children reside in the area. The large proportion of this population falls in the lower socioeconomic group, according to a recently conducted census in 2008, making the site eminently suitable to test out the trial hypotheses.

The Department of Pediatrics \& Child Health, AKU has established liaison with the community members and local government stakeholders, with its research office located in a district-level tertiary care hospital. The nearby vaccination center would assist in delivering the OPV doses, according to the EPI schedule, along with other EPI vaccines. The tertiary health care center (Taluka Hospital, Hala) would provide a place for evaluation and treatment for any unforeseen adverse reactions / events, free of cost.

Study population The trial would recruit full term healthy infants of either sex at or soon after birth and randomize them for supplementation as soon as possible after birth (within 72 hours and in tandem with the first OPV dose). Infants beyond this age and preterm infants (\< 37 weeks gestation or \< 2 kg birth weight) would be excluded.

Sampling strategy Eligible subjects would be identified and randomized to the respective intervention and comparative groups using computer generated three cell block randomization permutation tables.

Group A: Standard OPV schedule and oral zinc supplement (as 10 mg zinc sulfate liquid preparation) daily for 18 weeks.

Group B: Will receive standard OPV schedule and standard care. An identical placebo preparation, similar in taste, color and consistency will also be administered daily for 18 weeks.

The groups would receive standard OPV doses at birth, at 6 weeks, at 10 weeks and at 14 weeks of age, as recommended by the expanded program of immunization (EPI). As practiced by WHO and UNICEF, OPV doses would also be administered in the cohort, through the polio mass vaccination campaign, scheduled twice in every 3 months. The zinc and placebo preparation will be administered in equal volumes (2.5 ml daily), prepared by Atco Laboratories Limited, one of the leading pharmaceutical industries in Pakistan. . They would hold the allocation codes, replenish supplies at fortnightly intervals and maintain consumption records. The research and monitoring staff will be fully blinded to these preparations.

Given the need to follow individual level response, the investigators have chosen an individual randomized trial as opposed to a cluster randomized trial. The investigators shall employ a computerized block randomization strategy with groups matched in blocks of 20, with the codes maintained by Atco Laboratories Limited and the Chair of the AKU ERC.

Trained field workers will visit the households, 2 times a week to assess compliance to the assigned intervention at their respective time schedules, motivate families and evaluate the child as per a standard format. For the recruits in the research study, incentives would be provided in the form of soaps and cloths to be provided when the field teams visit the household for collection of blood samples from the study subjects. These have been selected in view of the immediate need of these to the recruited child residing in the area of Hala and through years of formative research for comparable projects in rural Sindh. These incentives have deliberately been kept modest so as not to pose undue incentives for participation. The health workers would replenish zinc or placebo supplies every 12 days (in 30 ml bottles).

Enrollment of participants Sample size estimates There is scarcity of research indicating the seroconversion rates to OPV among infants residing in a rural population of Pakistan. The investigators assumed that a conservative estimate of seroconversion to OPV among infants till 14 weeks of age for a rural population of Pakistan would be about 50%. These seroconversion rates are consistent with the lower limits of OPV seroconversion rates observed among breastfed young infants in one solitary study on the subject in Pakistan. To detect a 20% improvement in seroconversion rates upon zinc administration, the investigators would require a minimum of 242 subjects (121 subjects occupying each group) at 5% level of significance and 90% power. Estimating a 30% maximum dropout or refusal rate in comparable studies involving serological testing, the investigators would require a total of 320 subjects, with 160 subjects occupying each group.

Identification and informed consent A cohort of pregnant women (in their third trimester) would be identified through the baseline census and subsequent updates during the surveillance period. The investigators will then identify births within 24 hours of birth through an information system employing the assistance of Lady Health Workers (LHWs) of the area and the traditional birth attendants (TBAs). Families will be visited prior to birth to sensitize them about the study and provide an information sheet. Following notification of births, the families will be visited again and informed consent sought prior to initial randomization. The recruited infants and families will be visited, 3 times per week to assess morbidity and growth (height, weight, mid-arm circumference and head circumference). Close liaison would be maintained with the local vaccination centers, where the OPV doses would be administered to the infants according to the EPI schedule of Immunization. Efforts would be made by the research staff to maintain a record of all vaccinations of the recruited cohort, along with dates for subsequent vaccinations.

Surveillance and data collection A research team would be assembled, constituting of research supervisors, field supervisors, research medical officers, phlebotomists and community health workers.

For the census update, a data collector is capable of visiting at least 30 households per day; thus the census update could be covered in a months' time.

Recruitment of subjects in the trial could get covered in less than 2 months. For the trial activity, at least 8 teams would be delegated, with each covering at least 40 households per day. Each household (bearing one potential subject) would be visited 2 times in a week.

A 3-day training program would be imparted to familiarize them of the research protocol, the field operations for the activities of the census/survey and the research trial and measures for completing the forms. A series of data collection forms would be drafted (initially in English; then translated to Urdu and Sindhi languages) to collect information during the entire research period. A case recruitment form (CRF) would be drafted, which would be filled by research medical officers and would bear questions/items on birth history, immunization status, medical history, anthropometry and physical examination. The subjects would be followed up on a regular basis (2 times a week) by the research appointed community health workers with a minimum qualification of matriculation (grade 10 education), using a pre-defined follow up form. The CHWs will record data on immunization status, medical history and management of any ailment (especially diarrhea), anthropometric assessment and medical examination, and laboratory test results (blood serology and ELISA). Immunization status of each recruit would be maintained for every OPV dose provided to the recruited infants. The data would be collected by the CHWs during their regular follow ups in the area through assessment of vaccination records and finger marking during or after campaigns. A supplementation form would be maintained regularly to ensure compliance in all groups and replenished. This would be recorded by the community health workers undertaking household surveillance. All the forms would bear the general information of the child and the intervention codes allotted by Atco laboratories. Research medical officers, in addition to leading the field teams, would also be entrusted to oversee any untoward events/reactions, among the study subjects. These would be brought to their notice by the circulating CHWs. If encountered, the adverse events would be documented followed by its clinically appropriate treatment. If a child, outside the recruited cohort is identified as in need of health care, the CHWs may refer the child to the Taluka Hospital, Hala.

Laboratory Analysis Blood samples (approximately 3 ml from the cubital fossa of either arm) would be collected at birth, at 6 weeks and at 18 weeks of age of the recruited infant, by phlebotomists with relevant experience of drawing blood among infants. The blood samples would be analyzed for polio seroconversion rates. Neutralizing antibodies would be determined using the methods recommended by WHO \[9\]. The investigators will evaluate antibody responses to OPV by serotype in close collaboration with CDC (Atlanta). A subset of the samples will also be locally tested by ELISA to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA as compared to the gold standard neutralization assays in detecting polio antibodies.

In order to investigate the impact of zinc on immune response to OPV, the investigators would determine the status of zinc (serum levels) in infants in all the groups. These would be determined from blood samples collected at birth, at 6 weeks and at 18 weeks of age and analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry using established micromethods. Other micronutrient indicators influencing systemic and mucosal immunity (hemoglobin, ferritin and vitamin A) would also be analyzed from the collected blood specimens of the recruited subjects.

The blood samples would be collected from the field and transported to the Nutrition Research Laboratory, Department of Pediatrics \& Child Health, AKU. A transport mechanism is well established which brings the blood and other biological samples from Hala/Matiari field site to the main laboratory at AKU on a daily basis. To save costs the same mechanism would also be employed for transportation of blood samples to the Research Laboratory at AKU.

Study duration The study is expected to last in total for 12 months; initial 3 months for census activities and field preparation and training activities, 6 months for the actual research trial, inclusive of recruitment, intervention, follow up and laboratory tests and the last 3 months for finalization of data analyses and preparation of the final report.

In addition, the investigators will collect stool samples to at 0 and 7 days after delivery at of the bOPV. The stool samples would be collected from the field and transported to the National Institute of Health (NIH), Pakistan and processed according to the standard protocol used in the global polio laboratory network, including poliovirus isolation, ITD and sequencing. Non-polio enterovirus (NPEV) will be isolated but not characterized. A transport mechanism is well established which brings the stool and other biological samples from Hala/Matiari field site to the Aga Khan University on a daily basis, where the samples will be stored until shipment to the NIH (a WHO Regional Polio Network Laboratory) in Islamabad.

Study variables

* Outcome variables: Seroconversion rates of polio virus (type 1 and type 3), from blood samples collected at the time of recruitment, at 6 weeks and 18 weeks, and prevalence of excretion of poliovirus serotypes 1, 3 at 0 and 7 days after the administration of bOPV
* Other variables: Data would be collected on birth history, immunization status, medical history and management, number and rates of diarrheal episodes, breast feeding practices, laboratory nutritional indices, anthropometric measurements (weight for age, weight for height and height for age), physical examination and vital signs, and other laboratory parameters, like serum zinc, C-reactive protein, polio virus seroconversion rates, etc.

Statistical analyses The collected data would be dual entered in a data base developed using Foxpro, and for further analysis using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Frequencies for continuous variables would be expressed as means ± standard deviations. Proportions would be calculated for categorical outcomes. Means would be compared using paired t-test. Chi square tests of independence would be employed for determining differences in associations. Differences in seroconversion rates and prevalence of excretion, if any, would be evaluated using ANOVA and non-parametric tests. Multiple logistic regression analysis will be undertaken to determine the nature of relationship between serum zinc status and optimal vaccine seroconversion.","Inclusion Criteria:

Study variables * Outcome variables: Seroconversion rates of polio virus (type 1 and type 3), from blood samples collected at the time of recruitment, at 6 weeks and 18 weeks, and prevalence of excretion of poliovirus serotypes 1, 3 at 0 and 7 days after the administration of bOPV * Other variables: Data would be collected on birth history, immunization status, medical history and management, number and rates of diarrheal episodes, breast feeding practices, laboratory nutritional indices, anthropometric measurements (weight for age, weight for height and height for age), physical examination and vital signs, and other laboratory parameters, like serum zinc, C-reactive protein, polio virus seroconversion rates, etc. Statistical analyses The collected data would be dual entered in a data base developed using Foxpro, and for further analysis using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Frequencies for continuous variables would be expressed as means ± standard deviations. Proportions would be calculated for categorical outcomes. Means would be compared using paired t-test. Chi square tests of independence would be employed for determining differences in associations. Differences in seroconversion rates and prevalence of excretion, if any, would be evaluated using ANOVA and non-parametric tests. Multiple logistic regression analysis will be undertaken to determine the nature of relationship between serum zinc status and optimal vaccine seroconversion.

Subjects will receive detailed instructions regarding the order and duration of application of each product.

Subjects in the active arm will receive active capsules, shampoo, conditioner and topical nutriment. Subjects on placebo will receive placebo capsules, shampoo, conditioner and topical nutriment. All subjects will be instructed to take the capsules orally, one in the morning and one in the evening, prior to consuming food. Shampoo and conditioner are to be used once per day when washing the hair and nutriment applied at the end of the day prior to bedtime. To facilitate this, subjects will receive a 3-month supply of each product (supplement, shampoo, conditioner, and scalp nutriment). Subjects will continue the daily regimen for 24 weeks, visiting the clinic at week 12 for an interim assessment.","This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm parallel study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a multi-molecular targeting botanical treatment regimen on parameters of hair growth, compared to placebo, in healthy female adults with androgenetic alopecia, diffuse hair loss or self-reported thinning hair.

Each study group will include 23 subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned using computer generated randomization scheme to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio.

Subjects will be asked to use the study products on a daily basis for the duration of the 24-week study. Subjects will take one capsule twice daily (one in the morning and one in the evening) and will be instructed to use 3-7mL of the shampoo, 3-7mL of the conditioner, and 1mL of the topical nutriment serum daily. Subjects will receive detailed instructions regarding the order, and duration of application of each product.

This trial will be conducted at one (1) American (USA) clinical research site. The duration of the study will be approximately 28 weeks (7 months), including the screening period. There will be a screening period of up to 28 days for eligibility assessment, followed by a baseline visit followed by a 24-week experimentation period for assessment of supplement effects. There will be a total of seven visits, including a screening visit, over this 28-week period.

The study will be conducted as outlined in this protocol and in compliance with the principles of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (E.6), and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Prior to initiating any study-related procedures, each subject must provide written informed consent in accordance with Institutional Research Board (IRB) requirements and applicable regulations.

Early Termination/Discontinuation Visit

Subjects may elect to independently withdraw from participation in the study at any time. At a termination visit, subjects will be encouraged to undergo the procedures specified in the final study visit. Reasons for early termination/ discontinuation may include the subject developing any condition which contravenes the original criteria, or, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), the subject is considered to be unsuitable to continue the study. Individual subjects may have administration temporarily interrupted at the discretion of the PI, e.g. for adverse events (AE's) that are subsequently resolved. Subjects MUST have permanent discontinuation in the following situations:

* The subject had a Grade 3 (severe) or an investigational product-related SAE as determined by the PI
* Subject withdraws consent or refuses further assessment during the study
* Participation in another clinical trial
* Subject lost to follow-up
* Death
* Protocol violation

Unscheduled Visits Any study participant who contacts the investigation site about possible adverse events that are more than minor and/or that persist will be asked to visit the research centre for an assessment as appropriate.

Safety Tests Blood will be collected at V1, V4 and V6 for analysis of safety parameters. Anthropometrics and vital signs are being recorded at study visits number 1, 4, and 6 as measures of safety. Additionally, safety will be assessed by means of reported AEs.

Stopping Rules/Discontinuation The Investigator may withdraw any subject from this research if circumstances arise that warrant doing so. If a subject is withdrawn from the study for any reason, they will be asked to complete an early termination visit.

Permitted/Concomitant Medication(s) Subjects will be questioned about their medication history. The details of any medication taken will be recorded in the case notes and electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications (including supplements) not known to affect study endpoints are permitted.

Thyroid medications will be permitted where dosage has been stable for 6 months prior to the screening visit (V1) and subjects are not expected to have a dosage change during the study period.

Prohibited Medication(s)

Medications that are prohibited include:

* Anabolic steroids in prior 6 months and during the clinical study period
* 5-alpha reductase inhibitors in prior 6 months and during the clinical study period
* Products (including natural health products) and/or devices to promote scalp hair growth (e.g. finasteride, minoxidil, etc.) in 30 days prior to baseline (V2) and during the clinical study period
* Medications that are known to potentially cause hair loss or affect growth as determined by PI in 30 days prior to baseline (V2) and during the clinical study period
* Use of coagulation inhibiting medications (including natural health products) during the clinical study period
* Use of blood pressure lowering medications during the clinical study period
* Use of anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs taken for more than 2 consecutive weeks in the 3 months prior to baseline (V2) and during the clinical study period

Rescue Medication(s) As this study is investigating the effects of a product in a healthy population, there are no rescue medications in this study.

SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS NUMBER OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS It is estimated that up to 70 subjects will be screened, in order to identify 46 suitable subjects.

WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Subjects may withdraw from participation in a study at any time without consequence. If a subject withdraws from the study, the PI will make a reasonable effort to determine the reason for withdrawal from the study, which will be recorded on the eCRF, as will any AEs experienced by the subject.

Personal reasons (Subject-initiated): Participation in the study is optional, and a subject can withdraw from the study at any time, without consequence or prejudice.

Clinical judgment of PI: A subject could also be withdrawn from the study if, in the opinion of the PI, it is not in the subject's best interest to continue (e.g. AEs, need for prohibited medication, illness, etc.). All serious AEs (SAEs) will result in withdrawal from the trial.

Protocol violation: If a subject fails to comply with the protocol they may be removed at the discretion of the PI.

Reasons for withdrawal will be documented as one of the following:

W.1 Subject requests withdrawal from the study. W.2 Subject withdraws consent. W.3 AE makes the continuation of the subject in the study impossible or inadvisable.

Early Termination/Discontinuation Visit Subjects may elect to independently withdraw from participation in the study at any time. At a termination visit, subjects will be encouraged to undergo the procedures specified in the final study visit. Reasons for early termination/ discontinuation may include the subject developing any condition which contravenes the original criteria, or, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), the subject is considered to be unsuitable to continue the study. Individual subjects may have administration temporarily interrupted at the discretion of the PI, e.g. for adverse events (AE's) that are subsequently resolved. Subjects MUST have permanent discontinuation in the following situations: * The subject had a Grade 3 (severe) or an investigational product-related SAE as determined by the PI * Subject withdraws consent or refuses further assessment during the study * Participation in another clinical trial * Subject lost to follow-up * Death * Protocol violation Unscheduled Visits Any study participant who contacts the investigation site about possible adverse events that are more than minor and/or that persist will be asked to visit the research centre for an assessment as appropriate. Safety Tests Blood will be collected at V1, V4 and V6 for analysis of safety parameters. Anthropometrics and vital signs are being recorded at study visits number 1, 4, and 6 as measures of safety. Additionally, safety will be assessed by means of reported AEs. Stopping Rules/Discontinuation The Investigator may withdraw any subject from this research if circumstances arise that warrant doing so. If a subject is withdrawn from the study for any reason, they will be asked to complete an early termination visit. Permitted/Concomitant Medication(s) Subjects will be questioned about their medication history. The details of any medication taken will be recorded in the case notes and electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications (including supplements) not known to affect study endpoints are permitted. Thyroid medications will be permitted where dosage has been stable for 6 months prior to the screening visit (V1) and subjects are not expected to have a dosage change during the study period. Prohibited Medication(s) Medications that are prohibited include: * Anabolic steroids in prior 6 months and during the clinical study period * 5-alpha reductase inhibitors in prior 6 months and during the clinical study period * Products (including natural health products) and/or devices to promote scalp hair growth (e.g. finasteride, minoxidil, etc.) in 30 days prior to baseline (V2) and during the clinical study period * Medications that are known to potentially cause hair loss or affect growth as determined by PI in 30 days prior to baseline (V2) and during the clinical study period * Use of coagulation inhibiting medications (including natural health products) during the clinical study period * Use of blood pressure lowering medications during the clinical study period * Use of anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs taken for more than 2 consecutive weeks in the 3 months prior to baseline (V2) and during the clinical study period Rescue Medication(s) As this study is investigating the effects of a product in a healthy population, there are no rescue medications in this study. SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS NUMBER OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS It is estimated that up to 70 subjects will be screened, in order to identify 46 suitable subjects. WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Subjects may withdraw from participation in a study at any time without consequence. If a subject withdraws from the study, the PI will make a reasonable effort to determine the reason for withdrawal from the study, which will be recorded on the eCRF, as will any AEs experienced by the subject. Personal reasons (Subject-initiated): Participation in the study is optional, and a subject can withdraw from the study at any time, without consequence or prejudice. Clinical judgment of PI: A subject could also be withdrawn from the study if, in the opinion of the PI, it is not in the subject's best interest to continue (e.g. AEs, need for prohibited medication, illness, etc.). All serious AEs (SAEs) will result in withdrawal from the trial. Protocol violation: If a subject fails to comply with the protocol they may be removed at the discretion of the PI. Reasons for withdrawal will be documented as one of the following: W.1 Subject requests withdrawal from the study. W.2 Subject withdraws consent.

One of the four chambers, the left ventricle, is the chamber mainly responsible for pumping blood out of the heart into the circulation. Diseases of the heart like congestive heart failure (CHF), can cause the left ventricle to function improperly.

Medications called beta-blockers appear to reverse the abnormalities in the left ventricle and frequently improve the function of the left ventricle in patients with different kinds of heart disease. How beta-blockers improve left ventricle function is unknown.

One possible reason for improved function of the left ventricle with beta-blockers is improved blood flow to the heart muscle. When a region of the heart is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar (glucose). As heart activity increases, blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also. Knowing these facts, researchers can use radioactive sugar (glucose) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans to observe what areas of the heart are receiving more blood flow.

In this study researchers plan to measure glucose use in heart muscle and blood flow to the heart muscle in patients with CHF taking beta-blockers.","Deterioration in left ventricular function, which is characteristic in patients with congestive heart failure, appears to be a multifactorial process. Beta-blockers appear to reverse the deterioration and frequently improve left ventricular function in patients with both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. The mechanism by which beta-blockers improve ejection fraction is not known. Although it is well established that regional flow, function and metabolism may improve after coronary revascularization whether beta-blocker therapy will have similar salutary results in patients with congestive heart failure is unknown. The aim of this study is to: 1) quantitate regional glucose uptake and regional blood flow before and after chronic beta-blocker administration to patients with congestive heart failure using positron emission tomography, 2) determine if alteration in either regional glucose or lipid uptake or regional blood flow correlate with improvement in wall motion and global left ventricular function, and 3) determine if ischemic and nonischemic myocardium differ in blood flow or metabolism.","Left ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography of less than or equal to 40%.

National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),NIH,NCT00342784,Identification of Prostate Cancer Genes,"Genetic Analysis of Cases, Controls, and Families With Prostate Cancer","This study will identify genes that predispose men to prostate cancer and affect the rate and type of disease spread, the aggressiveness of the disease, and the long-term outcome. Several studies show there is a genetic component to prostate cancer susceptibility, and that a first-degree relative with prostate cancer increases a man's risk 2- to 3-fold compared to those without a family history. The risk is significantly higher if the relative was diagnosed at younger than 65 years of age, or if three or more first-degree relatives are affected.

The study will try to locate prostate cancer genes in DNA samples using two methods: linkage analysis and association studies. Traditionally, the search for a disease gene begins with linkage analysis, in which the aim is to find the rough location of the gene relative to another DNA sequence, called a ""genetic marker,"" whose position is already known. In genetic association studies, genes from a large number of patients are compared with healthy controls who are matched by age, race, and geographic region.

DNA samples for this study come from patients in the two following studies at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington:

Family study: Participants are families with prostate cancer who have: 1) three or more first-degree relatives with prostate cancer; 2) three generations with prostrate cancer either through the maternal or paternal side of the family; or 3) two first-degree relatives with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 65 or who were African American.

Population-based study: Participants are patients with prostate cancer and matched healthy control subjects.

The identification of prostate cancer genes important in susceptibility to the disease and its aggressiveness may permit earlier detection and development of more directed and effective treatments based on underlying genetics.","The notion that there are prostate cancer susceptibility genes has since been suggested by case-control, cohort and twin studies. The effect is strongest among first-degree relatives, where the relative risk estimates range from 1.7 to 3.7. Families reporting younger ages at diagnosis and multiple relatives with prostate cancer were demonstrated even higher relative risks. For example, compared to men with no family history, men with three or more first-degree relatives with prostate cancer have almost an 11-fold increased risk. Although the majority of studies focused on Caucasians, similar elevations in risk associated with a family history of disease have been reported for Asian and African Americans. While the majority of the data seems to point towards autosomal dominant genes, evidence for an X-linked or recessive inheritance has also been reported.

During the last decade, others and we have been devoted to the search for hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) loci either by linkage or by association with candidate genes. A generally agreed upon definition of HPC families now exists. These are families in which there is either: 1) prostate cancer in three or more first-degree relatives; 2) prostate cancer in three successive generations; or 3) a cluster of two relatives diagnosed at less than or equal to 55 years.

Armed with these criteria, others and we have collected large data sets of likely hereditary families and undertaken genome wide scans. However, locus heterogeneity issues have made the task difficult. There are clearly many genes that contribute to prostate cancer susceptibility, and many are likely to be weakly penetrant. We have stratified the data derived from our genome scan by a number of likely factors such as age at diagnosis, number of affected men, founder effects aggressiveness of disease, and presence of other cancers in the family to develop more homogeneous datasets. We propose to continue those sorts of studies, as well as focus on cloning genes in regions we and others have identified to date. To test hypotheses that certain variants are associated with prostate cancer susceptibility or progression of disease, will also conduct association studies in a population-based, case control study of middle aged men with prostate cancer. This will allow us to test the putative association of candidate genes and SNPs in prostate cancer susceptibility, aggressivity, and long-term outcomes.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

University of Novi Sad,OTHER,NCT06294002,Neuromuscular Training & Postural Stability,Effect of Different Neuromuscular Training Modalities on Postural Stability in Healthy Recreation People: A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Background: Postural stability (PS) is a vital function that helps maintain equilibrium during standing still, locomotion, and any activities requiring high balance performance. Under static and dynamic conditions, PS is a fundamental factor for the quality of movement in everyday activities or sports. PS and adaptive ability are required in sports due to the interactions between the sensory and motor systems, which regulate postural adjustments by processing information from the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems, as reported by previous studies. The interest in using different exercises and protocols for improving PS in sports and physiotherapy has grown in the last few decades. Experts have proposed various training modalities to increase neuromuscular stability, balance, postural control, and general stability. Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS) is a complex of correction exercises with a neuromuscular approach based on improving breathing, fundamental movements, and principles of developmental kinesiology. Whole body vibration training (WBV) is a neuromuscular training approach that has recently become very popular among researchers and practitioners in health and sport. It is usually used as an additional method in a conventional training routine. Designing the training program to achieve the optimal benefits for PS in healthy young adults is important in general personal health management. Although different training protocols have improved PS and general stability in everyday activities, there is still considerable debate regarding the optimal exercise modalities within an exercise program. Aim: The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of dynamic neuromuscular stabilisation (DNS), whole-body vibration (WBV), and a combination of DNS and WBV (MIX) training modalities on postural stability (PS) in healthy recreation participants. Method and materials: 180 gender-balanced groups were divided into four groups, MIX, DNS, VIBRO and CONTROL and underwent two months of treatment. The single and double-leg Center of Force (COF) parameters were collected on the Forceplate.","Study design The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of dynamic neuromuscular stabilisation (DNS), whole-body vibration (WBV), and a combination of DNS and WBV (MIX) training modalities on postural stability (PS) in healthy recreation participants. The study presents an Interventional study to improve postural stability, and the main objective is prevention. The study model is parallel with four groups.

Participants The randomised, controlled interventional trial enrolled a gender-balanced group of 180 healthy young participants. The initial sample of respondents was recruited through an open online application that lasted two months (from 10.2.2022. to 10.4.2022.) (n=250), after which the first selection of respondents was started (n=230). Recruitment was completed after the optimal sample of subjects was filled (15.4.2022). The study sample was divided using stratified randomisation into the MIX group (n = 58), DNS group (n=57), VIBRO (n=57), and CONTROL group (n=58). At the end of the experimental program, the final sample was 180 (MIX=45; DNS=45; VIBRO=44; CONTROL=43). When stratifying, researchers use proportionate sampling to maintain the correct proportions of genders in every group. After explaining the experimental protocol, each subject provided written informed consent before participating in the study, per the Declaration of Helsinki and the Novi Sad University Human Research Ethics Committee guidelines (ethical approval number: 46-06-04/2020-1). The interventional program was conducted from 25.4.2022. to 25.6.2022. Ethics committee - commission for the implementation of scientific project research.

The exclusion criteria were:

* history of neurological or musculoskeletal disorders;
* clinical conditions that could impair balance (motor disorders, medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, issues with vision, thyroid, nerves, or blood vessels).

The inclusion criteria for this study were:

• the absence of injuries in the past six months and the absence of other medical conditions, including COVID-19, no programmed physical activity in the past three months.

Testing procedures The testing was conducted at the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia. All participants were tested in the morning before their training session in indoor environmental conditions (temperature: 18-21°C; relative humidity: 40-60%). Before starting a performance task, general information about the examinees was recorded, including gender, age, height, and mass. Participants were instructed to wear minimal clothing and remove all footwear for height and mass measurements. In addition, they were required to eat and drink sparingly and void their bladder/excrete as needed before presenting for assessment. A stadiometer (0.1 cm accuracy, SECA Instruments Ltd, Hamburg, Germany) is a secondary outcome for height and mass measurements. Initial testing was conducted on 20.4.2022 and final on 25.6.2022.

Static PS was assessed with a laboratory-grade 0.5 m Footscan® plate (RSscan International, Lammerdries, Belgium) with 4096 sensors and a scanning rate of up to 300 Hz. The subject performed an individual single and double-leg task with three trials, each lasting 30 seconds with a two-minute break between each trial. During the double-leg stance test, participants were instructed to maintain an upright posture as still as possible. They were asked to stand in their natural, comfortable position with their eyes open and fixed on a cross positioned at approximately eye level on a blackboard 5 meters away. Participants stood barefoot with their feet placed shoulder-width apart on a platform, and their arms were kept by their sides. Each participant was required to maintain this stable posture, and measurement started after 10 seconds (preparation period to avoid transient effects). During the single-limb stance test, participants were instructed to balance on one foot. This foot was positioned to point directly forward, aligning with reference lines in the frontal and sagittal planes. The swinging leg was flexed at the hip and knee joints to approximately 90 degrees while both arms hung naturally and relaxed at their sides. Participants were further instructed to maintain as steady a posture as possible, focusing their gaze straight ahead on a point situated 65 centimetres away on the wall. The order of testing between the left and right legs was randomised. Each participant was required to maintain this stable position, and measurement started after 5 seconds (preparation period to avoid transient effects).

Tests for static PS were the gold standard in measuring balance and were used to obtain biomechanical parameters of static PS. All measurements were performed in triplicate, and the mean score was retained for subsequent evaluations and analyses. The sequence of performing the balance tasks was randomised.

The software calculated the single and double-leg Sway Area (cm²), Center of Force (COF) travelled way (mm), Medio-Lateral (ML) displacement (mm), and Anterior-Posterior (AP) displacement (mm) as primary outcomes. As stated in previous research, the following protocol was chosen based on their varying difficulty and everyday use and is cited as reliable.

Interventions Dynamic neuromuscular stabilisation group (DNS) The DNS group's protocol involved 5 min a moderate-intensity warm-up, 40 minutes of DNS movements according to the DNS approach, different diaphragmatic breathing, mobility and controlled movement exercises and 5 minutes of cool-down. Exercises gradually increased in complexity and difﬁculty level regarding DNS training principles. The participants were instructed to refrain from engaging in high-intensity anaerobic or anaerobic resistance training throughout the study period to prevent potential disruptions in the study results.

Whole body vibration group (VIBRO) WBV was performed on the Power Plate Next Generation vibration platform (Power Plate North America, Chicago, IL). All training routines were approximately 50 minutes long, commencing with 5 minutes of moderate-intensity warm-up and concluding with a cool-down period. The program consisted of 8-10 static and dynamic exercises for PS that progressively increased in difficulty and complexity. During the training process, the frequency increased from 20 to 35 Hz in the last week of the experiment; the exercise duration was from 20 - 60 seconds (in the previous week), followed by 1-minute seated rest. Moreover, the complexity and difficulty of exercise increased over the experimental period. The resting period between sets was constant from the start to the end of the training process. During the experiment, the WBV intervention group performed three weekly training sessions. The participants were advised to avoid participating in high-intensity anaerobic or anaerobic resistance training during the study to ensure that it would not interfere with the study's outcomes-no changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced. Principles and basic procedures were adapted from previous research.

Dynamic neuromuscular stabilisation with whole body vibration group (MIX) During the two months, participants in the MIX group performed training consisting of 3 weekly sessions. The protocol consisted of a 50-minute exercise program with a 5-minute moderate-intensity warm-up and cool-down period per training session. The structural core of training included 20 minutes of WBV and 20 minutes of DNS training. Both protocols followed the previous research and training recommendations and were performed with less time and sets. Exercises with VIBRO were performed on the Power Plate Next Generation vibration platform (Power Plate North America, Chicago, IL). The program consisted of 6-8 exercises (static and dynamic) for balance and PS. Exercise progressively increases by the level of difﬁculty. During the training process, the frequency was also increased from 20 to 35 Hz in the last week of the experiment; the duration of exercise from 20 - 60 seconds (in the previous week), followed by 1-minute seated rest. The resting period between sets was constant from the start to the end of the training process. To prevent any interference with the study's results, participants were recommended to abstain from engaging in high-intensity anaerobic or anaerobic resistance training throughout the study. Basic principles and procedures were adapted from previous research. WBV is followed by 20 minutes of DNS training, including specific movement exercises according to the DNS approach accompanied by breathing, coordination, mobility, and stability core exercises and routines suggested in previous studies. During the experiment, the MIX intervention group performed three training sessions weekly.

Control group (CONTROL) The control group did not exercise or use any training intervention or other habitual training during the past two months. During this period, the control group maintained their regular daily routines without any modifications. They refrained from engaging in any form of physical activity or participating in training programs that could influence their fitness levels.

Statistical analyses G\*power 3.1 power analysis software (Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany) estimated the minimum total sample size (N=140) given the critical F(3, 136)=2.67, an effect size f=0.14 (partial η2=0.02), p=0.05, 1-β=0.80, groups=4, time points=2, and correlation among the measurements=0.50. The authors presented data as means and 95% confidence intervals \[95% CIs\]. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Leven's, Box's, and Mauchly's tests confirmed the assumptions of normality, homogeneity of variances and covariances, and sphericity, respectively. General linear models (twelve separate 2x4 mixed-design analyses of covariances for each PS measure) estimated whether mean changes \[95% CIs\] in PS measure from initial to final testing depended on whether participants received the DNS, VIBRO, and MIX exercise program or did not (CONTROL) after controlling for mean-centered BMI. Following the time-by-group interaction effects, which revealed whether estimated changes over time depended on the participants' group (i.e., differed at least between one group-comparison pair), we computed simple effects tests to estimate mean changes over time (mean difference from initial to final testing) within the groups. The follow-up investigation proceeded with contrast analysis, which assessed the degree to which estimated mean changes of PS measures differed between the group-comparison pairs. The authors calculated the effect size for time-by-group interaction effects and simple effects using partial eta squared (partial η2: 0.01 small; 0.06 medium; 0.14 large) and Hedge's g average (Hedge'sav: \<\|0.20\| trivial; \|0.20\| small; \|0.50\| medium; \|0.80\| large), respectively. The Bonferroni test corrected p-values and 95% CI; the alpha level was p≤0.05. We used SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA) to analyse and plot the data, respectively.","Inclusion Criteria:

Patient Population: The patients included are to have functionally significant equinovarus spasticity in primarily one lower extremity; functionally significant spasticity is defined as spasticity impairing gait during observation of during a 25 foot walk, causing falls, or leading to secondary orthopedic complications such as genu recurvatum or pain in the low back or hip. The patients are to be ambulatory, with stable disease.

Dose Selection: A dose of 200 units to 400 units of Xeomin will be injected by EMG-guided technique into the appropriate muscles in the effected leg. These muscles may include gastrocnemius and soleus, tibialis posterior or other muscles as determined by the examiner. The dose administered will be determined by the blinded injector based on determination of muscle bulk and the degree of spasticity Blinding: Investigators will be blinded to medication used throughout study. Site will randomize subjects in a 1:1 fashion by using an unblinded site delegate.

Compliance with Laws and Regulations: This study will be conducted in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable local, state, and federal laws.

Study Assessments: After informed consent is obtained and screening measurements are completed, the patients will return at 4 weeks for injection for primary and secondary efficacy evaluations. Additional evaluations at 6 and 12 weeks will be made in order to determine the duration of effect of Xeomin for secondary efficacy evaluations.

Concomitant therapy includes any prescription or over the counter preparations being taken by the patient at any time from screening through the last study visit. All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded.

Patients enrolled in the study will be permitted to take all medication with the exception of the following

* Methylprednisolone within 30 days prior to screening
* Injection of any botulinum toxin within the past 6 months (180days)

During the study patients will be permitted to receive any treatment deemed necessary by the investigator for the management of disease. However patients requiring commencement of excluded therapies will be discontinued from the study and the data will not be used for statistical purposes.

Study Assessments:

Patients must sign informed consent form before any screening evaluations or measurements are performed. Patients must satisfy all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria to be randomized. Information regarding consented patients who are not subsequently randomized will be keep in the regulatory binder.

SAFETY MEASURES

Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events (AE's) and serious adverse events (SAE's). All SAE's will be reported to the FDA Med Watch within 48 business hrs of site notification of such SAE. For this protocol a serious SAE will be defined as any AE that is meets any of the following criteria:

* Fatal (i.e. the AE actually causes or leads to death)
* Life threatening (i.e. the AE in the view of the investigator, placing the patient at immediate risk of death)
* Requires or prolongs hospitalization
* Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e. the AE results in substantial disruption to the patients ability to conduct normal life functions)
* A congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the investigational product
* Considered a significant medical event by the investigator (e.g, may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above)

The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Med Watch is a Reporting system for Health Professionals

STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE A detailed description of the statistical methodology will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) which may deviate from the analysis outlined in the protocol; however, any substantial deviations from the protocol will be detailed in a protocol amendment.

Description of Endpoints

* Primary Endpoint Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in the Modified Ashworth score between Xeomin vs placebo group
* Secondary Endpoints

  * Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) Physical and psychological scores between Xeomin vs placebo group
  * Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in T25FW between Xeomin vs Placebo group.
  * Patient global impression of change (PGIC) between Xeomin vs placebo group
  * Clinical Global Impression of change between Xeomin vs placebo group
  * Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in Likert pain scale between Xeomin vs placebo group
  * Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in MSWS-12 between Xeomin vs placebo group.

Demography and Baseline Disease Characteristics

* Demographic and baseline characteristics will be presented descriptively (i.e., mean, standard deviation, median, range) and analyzed with appropriate statistical methods given the distribution and type of data.

Efficacy

* Analysis Population The Intent-to-Treat population is defined as all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment and who provide efficacy assessment.
* General Methods of Analysis Descriptive statistics will be provided for all efficacy endpoints. A two-sided test, p-value and confidence interval will be presented for analysis in general.
* Primary Endpoint Analysis The primary endpoint is the mean change from injection visit to week 6 in Modified Ashworth score . A two sample T-test will be used to compare the treatment difference between Xeomin and placebo group. If the data is not normally distributed, Wilcoxon's rank sum test will be used for the analysis.
* Secondary Endpoints Analysis Percent change from injection visit to week 6 will be calculated for the primary endpoint. It will be analyzed similarly as that for the primary endpoint. For secondary endpoints MSIS 29, T25FW, Likert pain scale and MSWS-12 a similar statistical approach as outlined for the primary endpoint will be used to assess the mean changes from injection visit to week 6 in each of the scales between treatment groups.

Patient global impression of change (PGIC) and clinical global Impression of change will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon's rank sum test.

(CoV-CONTACT-SERO),"In December 2019, a pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, in China. In a few weeks, the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection has dramatically increased, with almost 150'000 cases and more than 6'000 reported deaths on March, 16th 2020.

Little is known on the rate of human-to-human transmission of this new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the community and within the hospital.

Depending on the country, contact subjects considered to be at high or moderate risk of SARS-CoV-2 are, either isolated at home for a period of time defined by the health authorities or, on the contrary, continue their professional activity on the condition that they adopt measures to prevent transmission to those around them. In most European countries, healthcare workers adopt this second option. In all cases, it is most often recommended that contact persons monitor their state of health and communicate it to the persons dedicated to this action.

Whether such subjects become spreaders of the virus is not known, nor is the proportion of viral spreader who will develop a symptomatic infection.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the virological and clinical outcomes of subjects following a contact at high/moderate risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, in community-subjects and/or healthcare workers.

McMaster University,OTHER,NCT05549479,Virtual Peer-support Exercise Intervention for Older Adults with Cancer,A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of a Virtual Peer-support Exercise Intervention for Older Adults with Cancer,"Background:

By 2030, 23% of Canadians will be over 65 years of age. Two in five of these individuals will be diagnosed with cancer. Older adults have high levels of functional decline, and a cancer diagnosis adds prolonged physical sequelae to the natural aging process. Many of these effects can be mitigated by regular exercise. However, older adult cancer survivors are significantly less likely to meet current exercise guidelines than their younger counterparts. As our population ages, we need to develop effective, scalable interventions that support health in older adult cancer survivors. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a virtually delivered peer exercise intervention with qualified exercise professional (QEP) support for older adult cancer survivors.

Methods:

Participants will include older adult cancer survivors who are cleared for exercise, have consistent access to the internet, and currently take part in less than 150 minutes of exercise per week. All participants will be matched with a partner, given a peer support guide, and information on current exercise guidelines. In addition to being matched with a peer, dyads in the intervention group will have weekly virtual sessions with a QEP for 10 weeks. Participants in the control group will independently support their partner around exercise for 10 weeks.

Outcomes:

Participants will be assessed at 3 time points. The primary outcome is feasibility. This will be measured by assessing recruitment, retention, adherence rates to the intervention, and participant acceptability and satisfaction. Secondary effectiveness outcomes include exercise volume, social support, quality of life, physical function, and physical activity enjoyment.

Impact:

If effective, this will be the first virtual peer-based exercise intervention for older adult cancer survivors. Findings will inform future methods aimed at increasing exercise in older adults.","METHODS

Research Questions:

Research Question 1 (primary). Is a virtually-delivered, peer matching exercise intervention supported by qualified exercise professionals (QEP) feasible for older adult cancer survivors? Research Question 2. Do older adult cancer survivors who participate in a virtually-delivered peer matching exercise intervention with QEP support have improved levels of social support compared to those matched with a peer only? Research Question 3. Do older adult cancer survivors who participate in a virtually-delivered peer matching exercise intervention with QEP support have improved levels of physical activity behaviour, health-related quality of life and physical functioning compared to those who are matched with a peer only?

Study Design:

This is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment. The protocol and study methods adhere to the CONSORT extension for randomized pilot trials. The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board will approve this study. Dyads will be randomized (1:1) to the Intervention (AgeMatchPLUS) or control (AgeMatch) groups prior to baseline assessment. Group allocation will be centrally randomized using a web platform (https://www.randomizer.org/) by a graduate student external to the research team. A Research Assistant will assign group allocation in the order participants complete an initial demographics questionnaire and are matched with a peer for the study.

Intervention:

Peer Matching. A Research Assistant will match all participants into dyads based on evidence-informed criteria. To be matched, females must be in the same time zone and diagnosed with the same type of cancer. Matched peers will be introduced to each other by a Research Assistant via zoom after baseline data collection. All participants will be given a peer support guide that provides tips for supporting their exercise partner, an infographic on exercise guidelines for older cancer survivors and a Fitbit Inspire 2©. Partners will independently communicate and support each other around exercise for the duration of the study.

Intervention Group (AgeMatchPLUS). This group will have dyads participate in weekly virtual sessions with a QEP for 10 weeks. Each session will last up to 1 hour. The QEP (i.e., registered kinesiologist) will provide a tailored exercise program, focusing on aerobic activity with both participants in the dyad based on personal circumstances, cancer-related characteristics, side effects, current fitness level, and personal preferences. Overall, content discussed at the sessions will include a review of the exercise program, barriers to exercise participation, achievement of goals, and adverse events. For four weeks following the 10-week intervention, the QEP will be available for consultation (labelled ""tapering"" period) as needed by participants in this group. This tapering period is important to understand strategies to successfully taper older adults from an exercise trial. Also, during the tapering period, participants in this group will receive two supportive emails from the QEP encouraging ongoing maintenance of exercise and social support.

Control Condition (AgeMatch): Dyads in this group will independently communicate and support each other around exercise for 10 weeks. They will not have contact with the QEP during the intervention or tapering period and will structure their communication (mode and frequency) with their matched peer.","Inclusion Criteria:

National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS),NIH,NCT02257879,DHB Supplement Interaction Study,A Pharmacokinetic Study to Assess and Compare the Drug Interaction Risk of the Grapefruit Juice and Dietary Supplements Known to Inhibit CYP3A Enzyme Activity,"Background:

- Drinking grapefruit juice changes how long it takes some medicines to be broken down in the body. Researchers have found that a substance in grapefruit juice called DHB contributes to this effect. Some dietary supplements contain DHB and claim to increase the absorption of any and all supplements, medicine or any other drug. But these usually contain a lot more DHB than a glass of grapefruit juice. Researchers want to study the effects of grapefruit juice and supplements with DHB.

Objective:

- To compare how a certain dietary supplement (sold as DHB-300 ) versus grapefruit juice affects how long it takes a person s body to break down medicines.

Eligibility:

- Healthy volunteers ages 18 - 60.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.
* Participants will have 3 treatment visits. Participants cannot drive themselves home from the visits. Each visit lasts about 13.5 hours and includes:
* Questions about medications and participant s health.
* Vital signs taken.
* A finger probe to measure oxygen.
* Blood and urine sampling throughout the visit.
* An IV line inserted into an arm vein. It will stay there throughout the visit.
* Study treatments:
* Midazolam hydrochloride a syrup given to make people sleepy.
* Loperamide a tablet for treating diarrhea.
* 1 glass of water, 1 glass of grapefruit juice, or 1 pill of DHB-300. A different one will be given at each treatment visit.
* One week before each visit, participants cannot have certain fruits and juices. They must fast the night before each visit.
* For the 3 days after each visit, participants will return to the clinic 4 times. Their vital signs will be checked and blood will be drawn.","6 ,7 -dihydroxybergamottin (DHB) is one of the components of grapefruit juice and is a known irreversible inhibitor of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). A single serving (240 mL) of grapefruit juice (GFJ) contains less than or equal to 5 mg of DHB. The pharmacokinetic boosting effect of GFJ has fueled the marketing of dietary supplements labeled to contain DHB e.g. DHB 300 (TM) and Trisorbagen that enhance absorption naturally, While these supplements have been found to inhibit CYP3A activity, the DHB content in these supplements is much lower than that, of GFJ. Moreover, the effects of such supplements on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A-metabolized drugs are largely unknown. This single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-period, single-dose, crossover study in healthy volunteers will compare the drug interaction risk of a dietary supplement known to affect CYP3A with GFJ. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of a supplement known to affect CYP3A (e.g.Trisorbagen) with those of GFJ and water on the pharmacokinetics of two model substrates, the FDA-recommended CYP3A probe substrate midazolam, and the dual CYP3A/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate loperamide. This dual-probe substrate approach to assess drug interaction risk will provide mechanistic insight into any interaction observed. Eligible volunteers (n=12) will undergo 3 phases, each comprising an exposure visit and 4 subsequent post-exposure visits to collect blood and urine over 72 or 12 hours, respectively. Exposure visits will be scheduled at least 2 weeks apart to allow washout between the phases. At each exposure visit, participants will be administered oral doses of midazolam hydrochloride (2.5 mg) and loperamide (16 mg) concomitantly with water (240 mL), GFJ (240 mL), or Trisorbagen (with 240 mL water) according to a randomized treatment sequence. Blood and urine will be collected pre-dose and post-dose over 72 (blood) or 12 (urine) hours for subsequent analyses of relevant pharmacokinetic outcomes of each probe substrate, including the primary endpoints area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to infinity (AUC0-inf) and maximum observed concentration (Cmax). Secondary endpoints include geometric means, estimates of treatment differences, within-subject and between-subject treatment variance, as well as the 95% confidence intervals around those estimates.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

It will stay there throughout the visit. * Study treatments: * Midazolam hydrochloride a syrup given to make people sleepy. * Loperamide a tablet for treating diarrhea. * 1 glass of water, 1 glass of grapefruit juice, or 1 pill of DHB-300. A different one will be given at each treatment visit. * One week before each visit, participants cannot have certain fruits and juices. They must fast the night before each visit. * For the 3 days after each visit, participants will return to the clinic 4 times. Their vital signs will be checked and blood will be drawn. 6 ,7 -dihydroxybergamottin (DHB) is one of the components of grapefruit juice and is a known irreversible inhibitor of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). A single serving (240 mL) of grapefruit juice (GFJ) contains less than or equal to 5 mg of DHB. The pharmacokinetic boosting effect of GFJ has fueled the marketing of dietary supplements labeled to contain DHB e.g. DHB 300 (TM) and Trisorbagen that enhance absorption naturally, While these supplements have been found to inhibit CYP3A activity, the DHB content in these supplements is much lower than that, of GFJ. Moreover, the effects of such supplements on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A-metabolized drugs are largely unknown. This single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-period, single-dose, crossover study in healthy volunteers will compare the drug interaction risk of a dietary supplement known to affect CYP3A with GFJ. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of a supplement known to affect CYP3A (e.g.Trisorbagen) with those of GFJ and water on the pharmacokinetics of two model substrates, the FDA-recommended CYP3A probe substrate midazolam, and the dual CYP3A/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate loperamide. This dual-probe substrate approach to assess drug interaction risk will provide mechanistic insight into any interaction observed. Eligible volunteers (n=12) will undergo 3 phases, each comprising an exposure visit and 4 subsequent post-exposure visits to collect blood and urine over 72 or 12 hours, respectively. Exposure visits will be scheduled at least 2 weeks apart to allow washout between the phases. At each exposure visit, participants will be administered oral doses of midazolam hydrochloride (2.5 mg) and loperamide (16 mg) concomitantly with water (240 mL), GFJ (240 mL), or Trisorbagen (with 240 mL water) according to a randomized treatment sequence. Blood and urine will be collected pre-dose and post-dose over 72 (blood) or 12 (urine) hours for subsequent analyses of relevant pharmacokinetic outcomes of each probe substrate, including the primary endpoints area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to infinity (AUC0-inf) and maximum observed concentration (Cmax). Secondary endpoints include geometric means, estimates of treatment differences, within-subject and between-subject treatment variance, as well as the 95% confidence intervals around those estimates. * INCLUSION CRITERIA: * Age 18-60 * Men and non-pregnant women * Participant in the Environmental Polymorphisms Registry. Prior to enrollment in this study the participant will be required to enroll in the -Environmental Polymorphisms Registry. * Willing to abstain from fruit juices, star fruit, grapefruit and grapefruit-related fruits (e.g., pomelo, Seville orange), and grapefruitcontaining products for 1 week prior to Exposure Visits and for the 4 follow-up visits. * Willing to fast (with the exception of water) from midnight prior to the screening visit and each Exposure Visit, including abstaining from alcohol and caffeinated beverages -Ability to successfully complete treatment visits, including securing transportation EXCLUSION CRITERIA: * Women who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding * Current use of known CYP3A inhibitors or inducers, which in the opinion of the Investigator poses an unacceptable risk to the patient or to the validity of study results.

Instituto Dante Pazzanese de Cardiologia,OTHER,NCT02671084,Sevoflurane and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention by Stent,Effect of Sevoflurane on CKMB Release After PCI With Drug-eluting Stents: a Randomised Trial,"Increase in CK-MB after percutaneous coronary angioplasty more than 100% of baseline can represents a problem to the patients resulting in increase of morbidity and mortality.

Patients submitted of coronary angioplasty procedures can release in varying degrees of creatine kinase, MB isoform (CK - MB), on the order of 30% of all angioplasty.

Possibly patients who will receive sevoflurane experience a higher level of cardiac cell protection with lower incidence in the release of CK - MB values in excess of 100% baseline.","Several published clinical studies have shown the benefit of using inhaled anesthetic agents in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft(CABG). These benefits involve functional state of the heart and reduction damage to the organ. These events are related to intracellular phenomena that result in intracellular calcium homeostasis giving physical and functional benefits to the heart. Also disclosed is a modulation of the inflammatory response to endothelial level with resulting protective character to the coronary bed.

Patients submitted of coronary angioplasty procedures can release in varying degrees of creatine kinase, MB isoform (CK - MB), on the order of 30% of all angioplasty. Even in smaller increases than 3 times baseline, a criterion that defines myocardial infarction, clinical impact can already be found. Increase in CK-MB more than 100% of baseline can represents a problem to the patients. This elevation of CK - MB is associated with various factors such as age, characteristic of the lesion, clinical status of the patient, inferring that endovascular procedures of coronary, simple or complex, have associated myocardial damage, which depending on the intensity of the damage, results in increased morbidity and mortality.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Check for reduction in the percentage of patients that release CK -MB at levels above the 100% baseline in patients anesthetized with sevoflurane compared to the control group.

Patients submitted of coronary angioplasty procedures can release in varying degrees of creatine kinase, MB isoform (CK - MB), on the order of 30% of all angioplasty. Possibly patients who will receive sevoflurane experience a higher level of cardiac cell protection with lower incidence in the release of CK - MB values in excess of 100% baseline. Several published clinical studies have shown the benefit of using inhaled anesthetic agents in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft(CABG). These benefits involve functional state of the heart and reduction damage to the organ. These events are related to intracellular phenomena that result in intracellular calcium homeostasis giving physical and functional benefits to the heart. Also disclosed is a modulation of the inflammatory response to endothelial level with resulting protective character to the coronary bed. Patients submitted of coronary angioplasty procedures can release in varying degrees of creatine kinase, MB isoform (CK - MB), on the order of 30% of all angioplasty. Even in smaller increases than 3 times baseline, a criterion that defines myocardial infarction, clinical impact can already be found. Increase in CK-MB more than 100% of baseline can represents a problem to the patients. This elevation of CK - MB is associated with various factors such as age, characteristic of the lesion, clinical status of the patient, inferring that endovascular procedures of coronary, simple or complex, have associated myocardial damage, which depending on the intensity of the damage, results in increased morbidity and mortality. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Check for reduction in the percentage of patients that release CK -MB at levels above the 100% baseline in patients anesthetized with sevoflurane compared to the control group.

ICD therapy is an important treatment option for patients with serious recurrent abnormal heart rhythms. Overall survival is significantly improved in high risk patients who receive this therapy. This study will explore patients' perceptions of the impact of this device on their health status and well being, and their physical, psychological and social functioning.

Patients 18 years of age or older who have an implanted cardioverter defibrillator may be eligible for this study.

Participants will fill out a questionnaire booklet containing 170 questions about how they feel about their health, including their concerns and stresses, feelings about dependency on life-saving technology, and illness perception. There are also questions on demography, such as age, marital status, employment, etc. The booklet may take up to 30 minutes to complete.

Information obtained from this study may lead to a better understanding of how people feel about their health after receiving an ICD and help patients and families adapt to living with the device.","With the efficacy of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD ) therapy well established, the survival time of recipients of this technology must be interpreted more broadly. It is important to better understand how ICD recipients perceive their dependence on this life saving technology and how these perceptions influence their Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL). The purpose of this cross sectional, predictive study is to test a causal model that may explain the link between attitudes towards dependency on technology and HRQL in a sample of adult ICD recipients. The hypothesized model consists of seven variables: attitudes towards technology dependency; age; gender; illness history; illness representation; symptom distress; and HRQL. Adult subjects (greater than 18 years) who have received an ICD will be asked to participate. Subjects will complete a self-administered, mailed questionnaire that includes five instruments: 1) The Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 Survey Version 1.0; 2) The Important Concerns and Distress Questionnaire; 3) The Illness Perception Questionnaire; 4) The Dependency on Technology Scales; 5) Demographic Questionnaire. The model will be tested statistically by use of Structural Equation Modeling techniques. The definitive goal of this study is to develop a theoretically meaningful and statistically well-fitting model that specifies how dependence on technology influences HRQL. The hypothesis for this study is that the full structural equation model fits data from the sample of adult ICD recipients.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

ICD therapy is an important treatment option for patients with serious recurrent abnormal heart rhythms. Overall survival is significantly improved in high risk patients who receive this therapy. This study will explore patients' perceptions of the impact of this device on their health status and well being, and their physical, psychological and social functioning. Patients 18 years of age or older who have an implanted cardioverter defibrillator may be eligible for this study. Participants will fill out a questionnaire booklet containing 170 questions about how they feel about their health, including their concerns and stresses, feelings about dependency on life-saving technology, and illness perception. There are also questions on demography, such as age, marital status, employment, etc. The booklet may take up to 30 minutes to complete. Information obtained from this study may lead to a better understanding of how people feel about their health after receiving an ICD and help patients and families adapt to living with the device. With the efficacy of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD ) therapy well established, the survival time of recipients of this technology must be interpreted more broadly. It is important to better understand how ICD recipients perceive their dependence on this life saving technology and how these perceptions influence their Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL). The purpose of this cross sectional, predictive study is to test a causal model that may explain the link between attitudes towards dependency on technology and HRQL in a sample of adult ICD recipients. The hypothesized model consists of seven variables: attitudes towards technology dependency; age; gender; illness history; illness representation; symptom distress; and HRQL. Adult subjects (greater than 18 years) who have received an ICD will be asked to participate. Subjects will complete a self-administered, mailed questionnaire that includes five instruments: 1) The Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 Survey Version 1.0; 2) The Important Concerns and Distress Questionnaire; 3) The Illness Perception Questionnaire; 4) The Dependency on Technology Scales; 5) Demographic Questionnaire. The model will be tested statistically by use of Structural Equation Modeling techniques. The definitive goal of this study is to develop a theoretically meaningful and statistically well-fitting model that specifies how dependence on technology influences HRQL. The hypothesis for this study is that the full structural equation model fits data from the sample of adult ICD recipients. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Male or female adults (18 years of age or older).

Nevertheless, its use often results in a long duration of motor nerve block and a haemodynamical instability.

A first study has determined the ED95 of hyperbaric prilocaine 2% for intrathecal anesthesia in scheduled cesarean delivery. As opioid adjuvants potentiate the effect of the local anesthetics while decreasing their dose-related side effects, the aim of this study is to determine the ED95 of hyperbaric prilocaine 2% with sufentanyl for scheduled cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia,by using the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM)",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Nevertheless, its use often results in a long duration of motor nerve block and a haemodynamical instability. Recently developped, the Prilocaine, with its new 2% hyperbaric formulation, seems to offer a good alternative for hyperbaric bupivicaine. A first study has determined the ED95 of hyperbaric prilocaine 2% for intrathecal anesthesia in scheduled cesarean delivery. As opioid adjuvants potentiate the effect of the local anesthetics while decreasing their dose-related side effects, the aim of this study is to determine the ED95 of hyperbaric prilocaine 2% with sufentanyl for scheduled cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia,by using the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) Inclusion Criteria: * American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA) \< III * Age 18-40 year * Body Weight \<100 kg * Height between 155 and 175 cm * Gestational age\>37 SA * Elective cesarean delivery * Singleton pregnancy * Non complicated pregnancy * Signed informed consent obtained prior to any study specific assessments and procedures Exclusion Criteria: * Twin pregnancy * History of 2 cesarean section or more * Diabetes and gestational diabetes * Placenta praevia * Congenital foetal abnormality * Patient in labour * Membrane rupture * Known allergy to local anaesthetics * Disagreement of the patient * Pregnancy-induced hypertension * Pre eclampsia and eclampsia",OTHER
Biruni University,OTHER,NCT06939179,Effect of Face Mask Therapy on Blood Oxygen Levels,Evaluation of the Effect of Face Mask Therapy and RPE Application on Blood Oxygen Levels,"Skeletal Class III malocclusions are characterized by maxillary retrusion, mandibular protrusion, or a combination of both. In growing individuals presenting with maxillary deficiency, the face mask appliance is widely recognized as one of the most effective and frequently utilized orthopedic interventions. The primary objective of face mask therapy is to stimulate forward and downward growth of the maxilla by disarticulating and activating the circummaxillary sutural system. The application of protraction forces via a face mask results in anterior displacement of the maxillary dentition, accompanied by lingual inclination of the mandibular incisors. Orthopedic effects of the appliance typically include forward and downward movement of the maxilla with a slight degree of upward rotation, posterior dental extrusion, and backward rotation of the mandible. Numerous studies have demonstrated that combining rapid maxillary expansion (RME) with face mask therapy enhances skeletal outcomes, especially when initiated during the early stages of growth. Delayed intervention is often associated with reduced orthopedic responsiveness.

Foersch et al. evaluated the effects of pre-treatment rapid maxillary expansion on face mask therapy outcomes and concluded that expansion positively influences sagittal skeletal changes. In the absence of expansion, greater dental compensation was observed, particularly in the transverse dimension. From a clinical standpoint, anterior crossbite correction can typically be achieved within approximately 3 to 4 months, depending on the severity of the malocclusion. However, establishing a stable overbite and molar relationship usually requires an additional 4 to 6 months of treatment. A prospective clinical study analyzing treatment outcomes in Class III patients reported that overjet correction occurred through 31% maxillary advancement, 21% mandibular retraction, 28% labial proclination of the maxillary incisors, and 20% lingual retroclination of the mandibular incisors. To compensate for potential adverse effects of late mandibular growth, overcorrection of the overjet and molar relationship has been recommended. RME has also been associated with significant anatomical and functional changes in the upper airway. Specifically, an increase in the width of the nasal cavity base leads to a reduction in nasal airway resistance and improvement in nasal respiration. Recent investigations have documented post-treatment increases in pharyngeal airway dimensions and corresponding enhancements in nasal breathing. In a clinical study involving 25 patients with Class III malocclusion due to maxillary deficiency, face mask therapy resulted in a significant increase in nasopharyngeal airway space, which remained stable after a four-year follow-up period. Another study comparing 18 patients treated with RME and face mask therapy against an untreated control group of 163 individuals demonstrated a statistically significant enlargement of the nasopharyngeal space in the treated group. Pulse oximetry operates based on two fundamental physical principles. First, arterial blood generates a pulsatile signal, while non-pulsatile signals originate from venous and capillary beds. Second, modern oximeters utilize light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emitting at wavelengths of 660 nm (red) and 940 nm (infrared), as oxyhemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin display distinct absorption spectra at these wavelengths. In a study conducted by Niaki et al., among patients exhibiting mouth breathing patterns, 65.4% were classified as hypoxemic, while 34.6% had normal oxygen saturation levels. Gender analysis revealed that 31.4% of males and 40% of females demonstrated normal oxygen saturation.Mouth breathing has been shown to influence craniofacial growth and may contribute to the development of various malocclusion patterns.

Is it Necessary?,"Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a very common complication of cholelithiasis, encountered in 20% of symptomatic patients.

Nowadays laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the standard treatment in mild and moderates forms of diseases and antibiotic therapy in the postoperatory of these patients remains under discussion. However in the beginning, AC presents itself as an steril process, the obstruction of the cystic duct initiates a cascade of inflammation, ischaemia and necrosis, as well as bacterial proliferation within the gallbladder lumen. Bactibilia was a significant factor associated with total, as well as infectious, operative complications. Regarding this, for some authors, monotherapy with amoxicillin clavulanic (AMC) would be the best treatment after LC in patients with mild and moderate cholecystitis without intraoperative complications such as bile peritonitis, cholangitis, gallbladder perforation or abscess. In the other hand, others do not prescribe antimicrobial treatment after surgery in these selected patients.

There is controversy regarding the postoperative treatment with antibiotics in patients with mild and moderate cholecystitis and all the evidence about this topic.

Therefore, investigators decided to conduct a prospective randomized study in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute mild and moderate cholecystitis cancer. The patients will be randomized to receive AMC or placebo after surgery. With this study investigators intend to prove that are no clinical differences in postoperative outcomes between patients treated with AMC and placebo.

Is it Necessary? Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a very common complication of cholelithiasis, encountered in 20% of symptomatic patients. Nowadays laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the standard treatment in mild and moderates forms of diseases and antibiotic therapy in the postoperatory of these patients remains under discussion. However in the beginning, AC presents itself as an steril process, the obstruction of the cystic duct initiates a cascade of inflammation, ischaemia and necrosis, as well as bacterial proliferation within the gallbladder lumen. Bactibilia was a significant factor associated with total, as well as infectious, operative complications. Regarding this, for some authors, monotherapy with amoxicillin clavulanic (AMC) would be the best treatment after LC in patients with mild and moderate cholecystitis without intraoperative complications such as bile peritonitis, cholangitis, gallbladder perforation or abscess. In the other hand, others do not prescribe antimicrobial treatment after surgery in these selected patients. There is controversy regarding the postoperative treatment with antibiotics in patients with mild and moderate cholecystitis and all the evidence about this topic. Therefore, investigators decided to conduct a prospective randomized study in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute mild and moderate cholecystitis cancer. The patients will be randomized to receive AMC or placebo after surgery. With this study investigators intend to prove that are no clinical differences in postoperative outcomes between patients treated with AMC and placebo. The primary aim of the trial is to assess that there are no benefits in the use of postoperative antibiotics in patients whit mild or moderate acute cholecystitis in whom a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed.

Montefiore Medical Center,OTHER,NCT00415584,Cinacalcet to Treat Hypercalcemia in Renal Transplant Recipients,"Cinacalcet for Treatment of Persistent Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Renal Transplant Recipients: Effect on Renal Function, Serum Calcium and Bone Histomorphometry","Secondary hyperparathyroidism can persist following successful renal transplantation and can cause high blood calcium, kidney dysfunction or failure and excessive bone loss among other problems. If the condition does not resolve, surgery is frequently required to remove the parathyroid glands, with all the inherent risks of surgery. Cinacalcet, a medicine used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with kidney disease, may be effective in treating this condition in renal transplant recipients. The investigator team will study the effect of cinacalcet on calcium, bone and renal function in a 6 month treatment protocol.","Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in the renal transplant recipient can cause abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, resulting in hypercalcemia that is detrimental to renal function, causing renal dysfunction and calcinosis. These patients often require parathyroidectomy to correct the hypercalcemia. Surgery is not without significant risk to the patient. Risks include vocal cord paralysis, protracted hypocalcemia, cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps. In addition, parathyroidectomy has been associated with subsequent renal impairment.

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that is very effective in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal failure as well as in hypercalcemia of parathyroid cancer. There have been reports of short term Cinacalcet use in renal transplant recipients. Serum calcium was improved in these patients.

However, little is known about the effect of cinacalcet on bone activity and turnover. It is not known whether Cinacalcet causes low turnover bone activity with adynamic bone disease. It is known that low turnover bone disease in renal patients can by itself cause hypercalcemia as the bone becomes static and unable to respond to everyday calcium loads.

Studies have shown that adynamic bone can develop in renal transplant recipients under a variety of conditions. It is not known what effect, if any, cinacalcet has on the bone activity of renal transplant recipients with persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of Cinacalcet on serum calcium, renal function and bone histology in renal transplant recipients.

This is a prospective, open-label study. Protocol procedures will include baseline and 6 month measurements of bone mineral density, bone biochemical parameters, glomerular filtration rate, anterior iliac crest bone biopsy. Subjects will start cinacalcet after the first biopsy. The medication will be titrated to normalize serum calcium. Medication will be supplied by the study. Serum electrolytes will be monitored as indicated.","Inclusion Criteria:

If the condition does not resolve, surgery is frequently required to remove the parathyroid glands, with all the inherent risks of surgery. Cinacalcet, a medicine used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with kidney disease, may be effective in treating this condition in renal transplant recipients. The investigator team will study the effect of cinacalcet on calcium, bone and renal function in a 6 month treatment protocol. Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in the renal transplant recipient can cause abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, resulting in hypercalcemia that is detrimental to renal function, causing renal dysfunction and calcinosis. These patients often require parathyroidectomy to correct the hypercalcemia. Surgery is not without significant risk to the patient. Risks include vocal cord paralysis, protracted hypocalcemia, cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps. In addition, parathyroidectomy has been associated with subsequent renal impairment. Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that is very effective in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal failure as well as in hypercalcemia of parathyroid cancer. There have been reports of short term Cinacalcet use in renal transplant recipients. Serum calcium was improved in these patients. However, little is known about the effect of cinacalcet on bone activity and turnover. It is not known whether Cinacalcet causes low turnover bone activity with adynamic bone disease. It is known that low turnover bone disease in renal patients can by itself cause hypercalcemia as the bone becomes static and unable to respond to everyday calcium loads. Studies have shown that adynamic bone can develop in renal transplant recipients under a variety of conditions. It is not known what effect, if any, cinacalcet has on the bone activity of renal transplant recipients with persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism. The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of Cinacalcet on serum calcium, renal function and bone histology in renal transplant recipients. This is a prospective, open-label study. Protocol procedures will include baseline and 6 month measurements of bone mineral density, bone biochemical parameters, glomerular filtration rate, anterior iliac crest bone biopsy. Subjects will start cinacalcet after the first biopsy. The medication will be titrated to normalize serum calcium. Medication will be supplied by the study. Serum electrolytes will be monitored as indicated.

This study is designed to evaluate the adherence to extended deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis (DVT) with the direct oral anticoagulant apixaban on the background of historical data from the investigator's center on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) substandard adherence in the same setting. All guidelines have embraced the concept of extended DVT prophylaxis after major abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer, but the recommendation is consistently to use LMWH, which is more complicated than orally available prophylaxis, more expensive and has poor adherence. The patients will be identified in the pre-operative admission or in post-operative orders as potentially eligible for extended prophylaxis. On the day of discharge a research assistant or a research nurse will approach the patient, provide information about the study and obtain written consent if the patient fulfills the eligibility criteria. Each patient will be asked to take apixaban until postop day 29±1 and will be followed until postop day 90±3. The total duration of the study from first patient in to last patient out is expected to take 12 months. At 1 week after discharge there is a telephone contact to ask about any side effects from apixaban or bleeding events or signs of thromboembolism and to answer any questions from the patient. At postoperative Day +28-30 there is a telephone contact to ask about side effects, bleeding, signs of venous thromboembolism (VTE), until what date the patient has taken apixaban and estimate of missed doses using a standardized script. If the patient is still taking it, instruction will be given to discontinue. Self-reported modified Morisky Medication Adherence scale with 6 statements will be used At 90 days ±3 days there is the last telephone contact to ask about bleeding events or signs of VTE. The study is complete for the patient. At the time of Visit 4 the pharmacy that the patient uses will be contacted to provide dispensing record for apixaban, in order to verify that the patient filled the prescription.

University of Missouri-Columbia,OTHER,NCT03076684,Gender Differences in the Metabolic Effects of Uric Acid,Gender Differences in the Metabolic Effects of Uric Acid,"Increased stiffening of the heart and blood vessels is a predictor of heart disease. Stiffening has been found to be greater in women than men, which puts women with poor blood sugar control at a greater risk for heart disease than men. In women only, a molecule in the blood called uric acid can be elevated due to diets high in fructose consumption and it is thought to be a cause of heart and vessel stiffening. From previous research, we have found that restricting fructose in the diet lowers uric acid more in women than men. There is also a drug that can be used to lower uric acid. These findings suggest a potential approach to decrease vessel and heart stiffness in women. The present study will investigate fructose restriction in the diet and drug treatment to lower uric acid in the blood and its effects on heart disease risk in women compared to men.","This project will use treatments from 4-8 months to lower uric acid in men and women. This study has three parts and each subject will participate in only one part. Tests that will be performed before and after treatment include measurements of body weight, blood pressure, blood vessel stiffness, heart stiffness, and blood lipids and glucose.

Part 1: Dietary treatment The overall goal of part 1 is to remove fructose and simple sugars from the diets of women and men at risk for future heart disease. Dietary fructose will be replaced with starchy foods to keep the research subjects' body weights stable. Subjects will be treated for 4 months and measurements of vascular and heart stiffness will be made before, during, and after treatment.

Part 2: Drug treatment The overall goal of part 2 is to treat women and men with mild elevations in blood uric acid for 8 months. The treatment will be allopurinol administration, ramping up the dose over a 2 month period to achieve a uric acid concentration of 6 mg/dL.

University of Nove de Julho,OTHER,NCT03591484,Treatment of Halitosis With Photodynamic Therapy in Older Patients,"Treatment of Halitosis With Photodynamic Therapy in Older Patients: Protocol for a Randomized, Controlled Trial","Halitosis is the term used to define an unpleasant odor emanating from the mouth. Some lung diseases, such as bronchiectasis, are among the extra-oral causes of this condition. However, no studies have evaluated the causes and treatment of halitosis in the population of older adults with bronchiectasis. Methods and analysis: A randomized, controlled trial is proposed. The patients will be divided into four groups: G1- healthy older adults with 10 teeth or more (n = 40); G2- healthy older adults who wear complete dentures (n = 40); G3- older adults with bronchiectasis and 10 teeth or more (n = 40); and G4- older adults with bronchiectasis who wear complete dentures (n = 40). Halitosis will be evaluated based on the measurement of volatile sulfur compounds using gas chromatography. The participants with halitosis will be randomized into two subgroups: treatment with photodynamic therapy (n = 20) or cleaning of the tongue with a tongue scraper (n = 20). After the treatments, a second evaluation will be performed, along with a microbiological analysis (qPCR) for the identification of the bacteria P. gingivalis and T. denticola. If the halitosis persists, the dentate participants will received periodontal treatment and the edentulous participants will be submitted to hygiene procedures for the mucosa and dentures. The evaluation of halitosis and the microbiological analysis will be repeated. If the halitosis is resolved, the participants will return after three months for an additional evaluation. This protocol will determine the effectiveness of phototherapy regarding the reduction of halitosis in healthy older adults and those with bronchiectasis.","Methods:

A single-center, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial was designed in accordance with the criteria recommended for interventional trials in the SPIRIT Statement. The project for the proposed study received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Nove de Julho (certificate number: 87160418.7.0000.5511).

Selection of individuals - characterization of sample - One group will be composed of older adults (60 years or older) with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis in medical follow up at the Pulmonary Disease Clinic of the School of Medicine of the Universidade de São Paulo. After verbal and written explanations of the study, those who agree to participate will sign a statement of informed consent approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Nove de Julho. The group of healthy patients will be composed of patients in treatment at the dental clinic of Universidade Nove de Julho, who will receive clarifications regarding the study and will also sign a statement of informed consent. The study will be conducted in compliance with the precepts stipulated in the Declaration of Helsinki (revised in Fortaleza, Brazil, 2013).

Calculation of sample size - To achieve an effect size of 0.40 among the four groups (PDT in healthy participants. PDT in patients with bronchiectasis, periodontal treatment or denture hygiene in healthy participants, periodontal treatment or denture hygiene in patients with bronchiectasis), assuming an alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 0.80, the total sample will be 80 individuals (20 per group). The sample size calculation was performed using G\*Power (version 3.1.9.2) (Faul, 2007).

Inclusion criteria - Men and women aged 60 years or older, with or without a diagnosis of bronchiectasis, with more than 10 natural teeth or using complete upper and lower dentures.

Exclusion criteria - smokers or ex-smokers having quit less than five years ago, a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (which, although is a lung disease, has a genetic etiology) and hypersensitivity to the photosensitizing agent used in PDT.

Training and calibration of examiner - An examiner (gold standard) will perform training and calibration exercises to maximize the reproducibility of the measurements. For such, 10 individuals with halitosis will be evaluated using the Oral Chroma® device. These individuals will not participate in the main study. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be calculated for the determination of intra-examiner agreement (≥ 0.90) with regard to the halitosis readings.

Randomization - The 40 healthy dentate individuals will be randomized in two groups: Group A (20 individuals submitted to treatment with a tongue scraper) and Group B (20 individuals submitted to treatment with PDT). The 40 healthy edentulous individuals will be randomized in two groups: Group C (20 individuals submitted to treatment with a tongue scraper) and Group D (20 individuals submitted to treatment with PDT). Therefore, two independent randomizations will be performed for these distinct groups of individuals (dentate and edentulous). Opaque envelopes will be identified with sequential numbers (1 to 40) and will contain pieces of paper with the information of the corresponding experimental group (A or B and C or D). Block randomization will be performed in blocks of five patients (four blocks for both treatments; example of a block: AABAB). The envelopes will be sealed and kept in numerical order in a safe place until the time of the treatments. The randomization and preparation of the envelopes will be performed by a researcher who will not otherwise participate in the study. The same procedure will be performed for the patients with bronchiectasis. Randomization will be performed using Microsoft Excel, version 2013.

Characterization of the study - The experimental design will consist of four groups: G1- healthy older adults with halitosis and 10 teeth or more (n = 40); G2- healthy older adults with halitosis who wear complete dentures (n = 40); G3- older adults with bronchiectasis who have halitosis and 10 teeth or more (n = 40); and G4- older adults with bronchiectasis who have halitosis and wear complete dentures (n = 40).

Severance Hospital,OTHER,NCT03166384,ELectrosurgical Bipolar Devices VS Conventional Electro-cauterization in Breast Surgery,A Prospective Randomized Study Comparing Surgery Using Electrosurgical Bipolar Sealing Devices and Surgery Using Conventional Electro-cautery,"There was no study about application of electrosurgical bipolar sealing device for mastectomy in Korean population, because Korean national insurance did not cover use of the advanced sealing device until last year. Sample size of the previous studies was too small to draw a solid conclusion. Therefore, this study was designed prospectively to evaluate whether application of bipolar energy device for mastectomy could provide clinical benefit in terms of reducing seroma formation.","Lymphorrhea and seroma are the most common complications of mastectomy in patients with breast cancer. Seroma formation increases admission period, follow-up duration, and postoperative discomforts. Repeated aspiration of seroma increases risk of re-admission due to wound infection. Seroma formation after mastectomy occurs in 10% to 85% of cases with mastectomy. Known risk factors according to previous studies are old age(\>60 years), high BMI, tumor size, preoperative chemotherapy, surgical extent, and number of retrieved lymph nodes. To reduce postoperative complications including seroma formation, meticulous hemostasis and lymphatic ligation technique are necessary.

Procedures using new surgical devices such as bipolar sealing devices have been introduced. Electrosurgical bipolar sealing devices use the body's own collagen and elastin to create a permanent fusion zone through a combination of pressure and energy. Previous studies suggested that surgery using these devices lead to significant decrease of seroma formation, however their advantages are not well established in case of mastectomy for breast cancer. Several studies showed that an advanced sealing system like bipolar energy sealing system can reduce operative time and cost for postoperative management compared to conventional clamp and tie method in non-breast surgery.

If electrosurgical bipolar sealing devices are applied during mastectomy, there would be several potential benefits on vessel and lymphatic ligation. Conventional ligation and monopolar cauterization have several weak points including incompletion of ligation and thermal injury during procedures. On the other hand, electrosurgical bipolar sealing devices can provide a combination of pressure and energy simultaneously to minimize thermal injury and create a permanent fusion zone.

Previous studies suggested that electrosurgical bipolar sealing devices shortened removal time of drain after axillary lymph node dissection compared with conventional methods. Another study reported benefits on reducing blood loss, drainage amount, and length of hospital stay. Moreover, a recent study also reported that skin sparing mastectomy using electrosurgical bipolar sealing devices can be used in patients with breast cancer.

However, there are several limitations in previous studies. There was no study about application of electrosurgical bipolar sealing device for mastectomy in Korean population, because Korean national insurance did not cover use of the advanced sealing device until last year.

Moreover, the effects of such alternative interventions should be objectively quantified by means of reliable psychobiological parameters.

The goal of this study was to quantify the acute and persistent effects of a cosmetic routine based on the self-administration of a cream (DAVC) enriched with essential oils, namely Juniperus Phoenicea gum extract, Copaifera Officinalis resin, Aniba Rosodora wood oil, Juniperus Virginiana. This aim was achieved by measuring the (re-)activity of the autonomic nervous system (via heart variability indexes) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (via salivary cortisol levels), as well as through psychometric and behavioral assessments.

Fourty women, 25-50 years old, were instructed for a correct mode of self administration of the cream. On day 0, women came to the lab and were instrumented for electrocardiographic signal (ECG) recordings. Initially, a 10-min ECG was collected in resting conditions (baseline). Then, two 20-min ECGs were recorded, each following the self-administration (3-min duration) of the DAVC and a placebo cream (PLAC), in a randomized order. At the end of the baseline and the two post-cream administration recordings, saliva samples were collected. From day 1 to 28, subjects self-administered (at home, twice a day, at wake-up and bed time) either DAVC (n=20) or PLAC (n=20).

On day 29, they returned to the lab and ECGs and underwent a stress test (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST). The test lasted 10 min and consisted in a stress interview (5 min), immediately followed by an arithmetic task. ECGs were collected in baseline (10 min), test (10 min), and recovery (20 min) phases. Saliva samples were collected at the end of the baseline and the middle and the end of the recovery phase. The subjects filled a number of psychological questionnaires, including Profile of Mood States (POMS, on day 0 and 29) and STAI-Y1 (on day 29). In addition, subjects were videorecorded during the TSST, in order to quantify their non verbal behavior patterns (via ECSI).

A single, self-administration of DAVC (day 0) produced a significant, acute potentiation of parasympathetic neural modulation (HF index: 25% increase as to baseline), whereas PLAC produced only a modest change (3% increase). DAVC provoked a modest (10%), non significant reduction of cortisol levels, which was similar to that induced by PLAC.

Prolonged DAVC self-administration (4 weeks) produced: (i) a significant inhibition of stress-induced cortisol elevation on day 29 (55% increase as compared to pre-stress value in DAVC group, 75% in PLAC group); (ii) a significant improvement of mood profile (POMS test) on day 29 compared to day 0; (iii) a reduction of perceived anxiety (STAI-Y1 score) at the end of the TSST; (iv) significantly lower scores of behavioral patterns linked to anxiety, motivational conflict and avoidance and higher scores of affiliation during the TSST, as compared to PLAC group.

These autonomic neural, neuroendocrine and psychological data suggest that a cream enriched with essential oils has both acute and long-term stress-reduction effects on human psychophysiology. Acute effects involve a potentiation of the parasympathetic component of autonomic neural regulation, which is usually associated with well-being, relaxation and resilience. The long-term effects point to a generalized stress-relief property, involving both the hormonal and psychological sides of stress adaptation.","Inclusion Criteria:

Diabetic neuropathy most often affects the lower extremities and may be severe if inadequately treated. Blood glucose control is a critical treatment element, and several medications have been demonstrated to be effective in treating Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), including antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants and opioid analgesics. These medications are often limited by incomplete pain relief and side effects. This is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator or the patient know the name of the assigned study medication), placebo-controlled, crossover, parallel-group, multicenter study to determine the effectiveness and safety of 200 mg of RWJ-333369 given twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks compared with placebo in patients with DPN. The study hypothesis is that 200 mg of RWJ-333369 given twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks will be more effective than placebo in reducing pain due to DPN, as measured by average daily DPN pain scores. Patients will receive 200 mg of RWJ-333369 or matching placebo tablets, given in equally divided doses twice daily by mouth with or without food, for 4 weeks in each of the 2 treatment periods.","Inclusion Criteria:

A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study of RWJ 333369 for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of 200 mg of RWJ-333369 given twice daily by mouth compared with placebo in the treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN). Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of neuropathy in the Western World, with up to 50% of patients developing neuropathy as a long-term complication of the illness, of whom 10% experience pain. Diabetic neuropathy most often affects the lower extremities and may be severe if inadequately treated. Blood glucose control is a critical treatment element, and several medications have been demonstrated to be effective in treating Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), including antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants and opioid analgesics. These medications are often limited by incomplete pain relief and side effects. This is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator or the patient know the name of the assigned study medication), placebo-controlled, crossover, parallel-group, multicenter study to determine the effectiveness and safety of 200 mg of RWJ-333369 given twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks compared with placebo in patients with DPN. The study hypothesis is that 200 mg of RWJ-333369 given twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks will be more effective than placebo in reducing pain due to DPN, as measured by average daily DPN pain scores. Patients will receive 200 mg of RWJ-333369 or matching placebo tablets, given in equally divided doses twice daily by mouth with or without food, for 4 weeks in each of the 2 treatment periods.

If efficacious, our intervention could be disseminated in ""real world settings"" in an effort to prevent postpartum depression.","Recent estimates indicate that approximately 10-15% of women giving birth experience depression during the postpartum period (Dietz et al., 2007; Gaven et al., 2005). Research indicates that psychological interventions are efficacious for treating postpartum depression (Dennis \& Hodnett, 2007). However, it is important to also focus on the prevention of postpartum depression given many women do not seek treatment (Dennis \& Chung-Lee, 2006) and those who do seek treatment may have already experienced negative consequences related to depression including cessation of breastfeeding and poor maternal-child bonding (Dennis \& McQueen, 2007; Murray et al., 1999). Unfortunately, research indicates that psychological interventions are not efficacious in the prevention of postpartum depression among women at risk for postpartum depression (for a review see Dennis \& Creedy, 2004). Consequently, there is a need to test new and innovative interventions for the prevention of postpartum depression. Exercise interventions have been shown to be effective for the treatment of depression among adults and therefore, this intervention may be efficacious in the prevention of postpartum depression. The purpose of the present pilot study is to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants at risk for postpartum depression for a randomized trial examining an exercise intervention for the prevention of postpartum depression. We will also examine the preliminary efficacy of the exercise intervention on the prevention of postpartum depression. Specifically, 120 sedentary, healthy pregnant women who have a history of at least one depressive episode and/or have a maternal family history of depression will be recruited from various ObGyn clinics, psychiatry clinics, and via advertisements. Once the potential participants receive healthcare provider consent to exercise (approximately two weeks following a vaginal delivery and four weeks following a c-section), participants will then be randomly assigned to either an exercise intervention or a health and wellness contact control condition. The exercise condition will consist of telephone-based counseling sessions designed to motivate postpartum women to become physically active. This theory-based intervention will be based on interventions shown to be effective in previous studies. The contact control condition will consist of scheduled telephone sessions with a health educator on issues related to health and wellness (e.g., stress reduction, sleep, nutrition). The specific aims of the study will be 1) to determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining pregnant and postpartum women for an exercise intervention trial and 2) to determine the effect of a home-based behavioral exercise intervention on depression (as measured by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders; SCID-I and the PHQ-9) among postpartum women.

Advancing Clinical Therapeutics Globally for HIV/AIDS and Other Infections,NETWORK,NCT00991302,Durability of Adherence in Self-Management of HIV,Durability of Adherence in Self-Management of HIV,Adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is critical to successful treatment of HIV. This study tested an intervention that helps people infected with HIV take all their medications when and how they were supposed to.,"People infected with HIV must take the regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications as prescribed to them, without missing doses, or they risk developing a resistant strain of the virus. Resistant strains of the virus do not respond to certain HAART regimens and are more dangerous for patients. Poor HAART adherence can lead to further HIV progression, more hospitalizations and opportunistic infections, and required use of second-line therapies. Interventions to increase adherence have had mixed success, with little data to support long-term effects and no one strategy emerging that provides consistent positive effects. The client adherence profiling and intervention tailoring (CAP-IT) program was first developed to increase adherence among people already on HAART with in-home nursing. This study modified CAP-IT to treat people newly on HAART and then tested whether this modified CAP-IT improved long-term HAART adherence.

This study included two stages. The first stage consisted of two focus groups, one made up of HIV care providers and professionals and the other made up of people infected with HIV who had started HAART within the last year. Each focus group met once, for approximately 2 hours, to determine what modifications would best adapt the CAP-IT program to HIV-infected people first starting HAART.

The second stage consisted of a randomized trial comparing the modified CAP-IT program to standard of care. Participation in this stage lasted for 72 weeks.

This study tested an intervention that helps people infected with HIV take all their medications when and how they were supposed to. People infected with HIV must take the regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medications as prescribed to them, without missing doses, or they risk developing a resistant strain of the virus. Resistant strains of the virus do not respond to certain HAART regimens and are more dangerous for patients. Poor HAART adherence can lead to further HIV progression, more hospitalizations and opportunistic infections, and required use of second-line therapies. Interventions to increase adherence have had mixed success, with little data to support long-term effects and no one strategy emerging that provides consistent positive effects. The client adherence profiling and intervention tailoring (CAP-IT) program was first developed to increase adherence among people already on HAART with in-home nursing. This study modified CAP-IT to treat people newly on HAART and then tested whether this modified CAP-IT improved long-term HAART adherence. This study included two stages. The first stage consisted of two focus groups, one made up of HIV care providers and professionals and the other made up of people infected with HIV who had started HAART within the last year. Each focus group met once, for approximately 2 hours, to determine what modifications would best adapt the CAP-IT program to HIV-infected people first starting HAART. The second stage consisted of a randomized trial comparing the modified CAP-IT program to standard of care. Participation in this stage lasted for 72 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either standard care or the modified CAP-IT program in addition to standard care. The CAP-IT program involved two steps.

National Taiwan University Hospital,OTHER,NCT00361179,Long Term Effects of Peginterferon Alfa-2a Plus Ribavirin for Chronic Hepatitis C/B Co-Infection and Chronic Hepatitis C,"An Extension, Observational Protocol to Evaluate the Long Term Effects of Peginterferon Alfa-2a Plus Ribavirin for Chronic Hepatitis C/B Co-Infection and Chronic Hepatitis C in the Original Study ML17862","Chronic hepatitis C may relapse in simple chronic hepatitis C patients who initially obtained sustained virologic responses. Although the HCV SVR could be maintained in around 90%, the remaining 10% of these patients may develop hepatitis C relapse during follow-up. Therefore, it is important to follow up the long-term of these patients with dual chronic hepatitis B and C.

From another aspect, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, the virologic and serologic responses may also not be durable. Alternatively, previous studies suggested that the therapeutic efficacy might not be seen in the study period, and incremental response might occur during long-term follow-up. Therefore it is also important to clarify the long-term outcome of treatment in this dually infected population.

Evaluation of the long term effects of treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for patients with chronic hepatitis C/ hepatitis B co-Infection and chronic hepatitis C in the original study ML17862 is important. This present protocol is thus to assess whether the HCV SVR is sustained and to assess the durability of the HBV virologic and serologic responses or any incremental response during a 5-year follow-up period, including six months after end of the therapy in the original study and an additional 4 and half years in this project (5 years overall follow-up after the end of treatment). Specifically, we wish to assess the (1) sustained virologic response (SVR) of HCV in both populations, (2) incidence of HBsAg loss and HBsAg seroconversion (HBsAg loss and appearance of anti-HBs) in dually infected population, (3) ALT normalization or flare off-treatment during both populations, (4) reductions of HCV RNA from the original baseline levels in the two patient populations, and (5) reduction of serum HBV DNA off-treatment in the dually infected population.","Pegylated IFNs (such as PEG-IFN alfa-2a, PEGASYS®) have been shown to possess a superior efficacy and convenience to conventional IFNs, either alone or in combination with RBV in patients with chronic hepatitis C only \[Zeuzem et al, 2000; Heathcote et al, 2000; Fried et al, 2002; Hadziyannis et al, EASL 2002\]. For patients with chronic hepatitis B, pilot study also revealed that the biochemical and virologic responses were better in HBeAg-positive patients receiving pegylated IFN than those receiving conventional IFN \[24-week post-treatment combined virologic, HBeAg loss, and ALT normalization rate: 28% vs. 12%; Lai et al, APSAL 2002\].

The efficacy using a 24-week combination therapy in the sustained clearance of serum HCV RNA is equivalent to that using a 48-week combination therapy in patients with HCV genotype non-1 \[Hadziyannis et al, EASL 2002\]. A 48-week course of pegylated IFN and RBV combination therapy, in contrast, has been shown to yield a better efficacy in the sustained clearance of serum HCV RNA in patients with HCV genotype 1 than a 24-week combination therapy in western countries \[SVR: 40\~51% vs. 29\~41%, Table 1, Hadziyannis et al, EASL 2002; Poynard et al, 1998\]. Based on these findings, NIH Consensus Statement suggests that patients with genotype 1 need 48 weeks of combination treatment and standard doses of RBV \[NIH 2002\]. Previous study revealed that a 12-week RBV therapy was not effective for patients with chronic hepatitis B \[Kakumu et al, 1993\]. Therefore, in this proposal, the treatment duration will be 24 weeks for HCV genotype 2/3, and will be 48 weeks for HCV genotype 1, in patients with monoinfected chronic hepatitis C and dual chronic hepatitis C and B.

Increased RBV dosage has been considered as a contributory factor to the better efficacy in some previous studies. Recent studies suggested that using RBV 800 mg daily is adequate to treatment HCV genotype non-1 but standard dosage of RBV is required to treatment HCV genotype 1 \[NIH 2002\]. We follow the recommendations and use RBV 800 mg daily for HCV genotype non-1, both in dually infected patients and in monoinfected chronic hepatitis C patients. RBV with 1000-1200 mg daily will be used for HCV genotype 1 according the body weight of the patient, both in dually infected patients and in monoinfected chronic hepatitis C patients.

Previous studies suggested that chronic hepatitis C may relapse in simple chronic hepatitis C patients who initially obtained sustained virologic responses at 6 months after end of the treatment \[Chemello et al, 1996; Marcellin et al, 1997\]. Although the HCV SVR could be maintained in around 90%, the remaining 10% of these patients may develop hepatitis C relapse during follow-up. Chemello et al followed up 107 patients with chronic hepatitis C who maintained normal aminotransferase levels as long as 12 months after interferon-alpha therapy \[Chemello et al, 1996\]. Hepatitis C virus RNA was detected in 27 (25%) patients with sustained biochemical response; 80 (75%) patients were negative for HCV RNA. Patients positive for HCV RNA were older (P \< 0.001), had received a smaller interferon-alpha dose (P = 0.02), and were more frequently infected with HCV genotype 2 (P \< 0.01). Liver histologic findings were active in 57% of patients positive for HCV RNA, despite normal alanine aminotransferase levels, compared with only 12% of patients who were negative for HCV RNA (P = 0.01). The estimated probability of hepatitis relapse by 4 years after therapy was 53% in viremic patients and 0% in patients negative for HCV RNA (P \< 0.001). Marcellin et al followed up 80 patients who had chronic hepatitis C and received interferon-alpha therapy \[Marcellin et al, 1997\]. The 80 patients had follow-up 1 to 7.6 years (mean +/- SD, 4.0 +/- 2.0 years) after interferon-alpha treatment. The follow-up period was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and more than 6 years in 11, 13, 14, 18, 10, 12, and 2 patients, respectively, after the end of therapy. During the entire follow-up period, 93% (95% CI, 84% to 97%) of patients had persistently normal serum ALT levels. Serum HCV RNA remained undetectable in 96% (CI, 89% to 99%) of patients. A comparison of liver histologic findings before and 1 to 6.2 years after interferon-alpha treatment showed a clear improvement in 94% (CI, 83% to 99%) of patients. In 62% of patients, the last biopsy done showed normal or nearly normal histologic findings. Liver HCV RNA was detectable before treatment in all 13 patients tested and was undetectable 1 to 5 years after treatment in all 27 patients tested. They thus concluded that in patients with chronic hepatitis C who have persistently normal serum ALT levels and no detectable serum HCV RNA 6 months after interferon-alpha therapy, long-term sustained biochemical and virologic response is generally seen. Similar finding was noted in one reported case with dual chronic hepatitis B and C \[Yalcin et al, 2003\]. To be noted, this dually infected patient had reactivation of hepatitis B accompanied by severe flare of hepatitis activity during treatment and had relapse of hepatitis C after end of the treatment. Therefore, it is important to follow up the long-term of these patients with dual chronic hepatitis B and C.

From another aspect, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, the virologic and serologic responses may also not be durable \[Liaw et al, 2005; Lok et al, 2004; Hadziyannis et al, 2003; Janssen et al, 2005\]. Alternatively, previous studies suggested that the therapeutic efficacy might not be seen in the study period, and incremental response might occur during long-term follow-up as learned from previous experiences of using antiviral agents including interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B \[Saruc et al, 2003; Carreno et al, 2001\]. Therefore it is also important to clarify the long-term outcome of treatment in this dually infected population.

This present protocol is thus to assess whether the HCV SVR is sustained and to assess the durability of the HBV virologic and serologic responses or any incremental response during a 5-year follow-up period, including six months after end of the therapy in the original study and an additional 4 and half years in this project (5 years overall follow-up after the end of treatment). Specifically, we wish to assess the (1) sustained virologic response (SVR) of HCV in both populations, (2) incidence of HBsAg loss and HBsAg seroconversion (HBsAg loss and appearance of anti-HBs) in dually infected population, (3) ALT normalization or flare off-treatment during both populations, (4) reductions of HCV RNA from the original baseline levels in the two patient populations, and (5) reduction of serum HBV DNA off-treatment in the dually infected population.","Inclusion Criteria:

Although the HCV SVR could be maintained in around 90%, the remaining 10% of these patients may develop hepatitis C relapse during follow-up. Therefore, it is important to follow up the long-term of these patients with dual chronic hepatitis B and C. From another aspect, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, the virologic and serologic responses may also not be durable. Alternatively, previous studies suggested that the therapeutic efficacy might not be seen in the study period, and incremental response might occur during long-term follow-up. Therefore it is also important to clarify the long-term outcome of treatment in this dually infected population. Evaluation of the long term effects of treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for patients with chronic hepatitis C/ hepatitis B co-Infection and chronic hepatitis C in the original study ML17862 is important. This present protocol is thus to assess whether the HCV SVR is sustained and to assess the durability of the HBV virologic and serologic responses or any incremental response during a 5-year follow-up period, including six months after end of the therapy in the original study and an additional 4 and half years in this project (5 years overall follow-up after the end of treatment).

Pegylated IFNs (such as PEG-IFN alfa-2a, PEGASYS®) have been shown to possess a superior efficacy and convenience to conventional IFNs, either alone or in combination with RBV in patients with chronic hepatitis C only \[Zeuzem et al, 2000; Heathcote et al, 2000; Fried et al, 2002; Hadziyannis et al, EASL 2002\]. For patients with chronic hepatitis B, pilot study also revealed that the biochemical and virologic responses were better in HBeAg-positive patients receiving pegylated IFN than those receiving conventional IFN \[24-week post-treatment combined virologic, HBeAg loss, and ALT normalization rate: 28% vs. 12%; Lai et al, APSAL 2002\]. The efficacy using a 24-week combination therapy in the sustained clearance of serum HCV RNA is equivalent to that using a 48-week combination therapy in patients with HCV genotype non-1 \[Hadziyannis et al, EASL 2002\]. A 48-week course of pegylated IFN and RBV combination therapy, in contrast, has been shown to yield a better efficacy in the sustained clearance of serum HCV RNA in patients with HCV genotype 1 than a 24-week combination therapy in western countries \[SVR: 40\~51% vs. 29\~41%, Table 1, Hadziyannis et al, EASL 2002; Poynard et al, 1998\]. Based on these findings, NIH Consensus Statement suggests that patients with genotype 1 need 48 weeks of combination treatment and standard doses of RBV \[NIH 2002\]. Previous study revealed that a 12-week RBV therapy was not effective for patients with chronic hepatitis B \[Kakumu et al, 1993\]. Therefore, in this proposal, the treatment duration will be 24 weeks for HCV genotype 2/3, and will be 48 weeks for HCV genotype 1, in patients with monoinfected chronic hepatitis C and dual chronic hepatitis C and B. Increased RBV dosage has been considered as a contributory factor to the better efficacy in some previous studies. Recent studies suggested that using RBV 800 mg daily is adequate to treatment HCV genotype non-1 but standard dosage of RBV is required to treatment HCV genotype 1 \[NIH 2002\]. We follow the recommendations and use RBV 800 mg daily for HCV genotype non-1, both in dually infected patients and in monoinfected chronic hepatitis C patients. RBV with 1000-1200 mg daily will be used for HCV genotype 1 according the body weight of the patient, both in dually infected patients and in monoinfected chronic hepatitis C patients. Previous studies suggested that chronic hepatitis C may relapse in simple chronic hepatitis C patients who initially obtained sustained virologic responses at 6 months after end of the treatment \[Chemello et al, 1996; Marcellin et al, 1997\]. Although the HCV SVR could be maintained in around 90%, the remaining 10% of these patients may develop hepatitis C relapse during follow-up. Chemello et al followed up 107 patients with chronic hepatitis C who maintained normal aminotransferase levels as long as 12 months after interferon-alpha therapy \[Chemello et al, 1996\]. Hepatitis C virus RNA was detected in 27 (25%) patients with sustained biochemical response; 80 (75%) patients were negative for HCV RNA. Patients positive for HCV RNA were older (P \< 0.001), had received a smaller interferon-alpha dose (P = 0.02), and were more frequently infected with HCV genotype 2 (P \< 0.01). Liver histologic findings were active in 57% of patients positive for HCV RNA, despite normal alanine aminotransferase levels, compared with only 12% of patients who were negative for HCV RNA (P = 0.01). The estimated probability of hepatitis relapse by 4 years after therapy was 53% in viremic patients and 0% in patients negative for HCV RNA (P \< 0.001).

The follow-up period was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and more than 6 years in 11, 13, 14, 18, 10, 12, and 2 patients, respectively, after the end of therapy.

Unmethylated CpG DNA is a component bacterial genomes and is the agonist of Toll Like Receptor-9, an endosomal pattern recognition receptor of antigen presenting cells. TLR9 activation results in downstream production of IFN-α, interleukin-6 interleukin-12. These cytokines induce naive T cells to differentiate to helper T cells. CpG has demonstrated significant synergy with radiotherapy to induce regression of refractory systemic and cutaneous lymphomas both within radiation treatment field and un-irradiated metastases. SD-101 is a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide enriched with CpG motifs.

IDO is an enzyme that converts the essential amino acid tryptophan to kynurenine. The availability of tryptophan is essential to sustaining both helper T cell and effector T cell activation. Overexpression of IDO by tumor cells or antigen presenting cells serves to arrest T cell activation thus acting as an immunosuppressive enzyme. Epacadostat (INCB024360) is an inhibitor of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) that has shown promise in the treatment of solid tumors and lymphomas in ongoing Phase I/II studies.

The investigators have shown in animal studies that IDO upregulation limits tumor response to RT + CpG and that addition of IDO blockade improves therapeutic efficacy. On the basis of these data, the investigators hypothesize that IDO inhibition will improve upon the known historical efficacy of RT + CpG therapy, and will be highly effective and well tolerated in the management of advanced solid tumors and lymphomas.

This is a phase I/II study. For the phase I portion the primary endpoint is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of epacadostat in combination with radiotherapy and SD-101. For the phase II portion the primary endpoint is safety and toxicity per CTCAE v4.03 criteriae. The secondary endpoint is the abscopal response rate defined as the objective response rate at un-irradiated lesions per irRECIST criteria.

Up to three dose levels of epacadostat will be evaluated: 100 mg bid, 200 mg bid and 300 mg bid each day of the study. Radiotherapy will be delivered to the treatment lesion during the first week using standard-of-care palliative fractionation regimens of 8 Gy x 3 fractions, 4 Gy x 5 fractions, or 2 Gy x 2 fractions. Four milligrams of SD-101 will be delivered into the treatment lesion by intralesional injection on days 1, 8, 15, with optional additional injections on days 22, and 29. On Day 1, biopsy will precede intralesional injection, RT, or epacadostat. Intralesional injections will be performed by palpation of the lesion or under ultrasound or CT guidance as indicated. CT response assessments and labs will be performed every 60 days. Patients will continue on epacadostat until progression.","Inclusion Criteria:

As part of this protocol, 55 individuals with chronic stroke will be assigned to either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2, and will participate in 1-18 gait training sessions. If interested, study participants can also complete both study cohorts sequentially (with at least 3-weeks duration between switching from one cohort to the second). The study examines the effects among two cohorts of post stroke patients. Cohort 1 will participate in 18 sessions of fast treadmill walking plus Functional Electrical Stimulation (FastFES) and Cohort 2 will participate in 1-3 sessions of FastFES and fast walking without FES.","Stroke is the number one cause of disability. Difficulty with walking affects most stroke survivors. Walking deficits (e.g. reduced ankle flexion during swing phase, decreased forward propulsion during terminal stance) can cause risks of falls, slow walking speed, increased effort of walking, and difficulties with activities of daily living. Restoration of walking ability can improve quality of life, and is perceived as a major goal of rehabilitation by stroke survivors. Examples of interventions that are used to rehabilitate walking post-stroke are functional electrical stimulation, fast treadmill walking, and bio- feedback. While recent research has focused on comparing the effectiveness of different gait rehabilitation interventions, the neural and biomechanical mechanisms underlying different gait rehabilitation strategies are unknown. FastFES is a novel gait training intervention that combines the beneficial effects of two independent interventions: Fast treadmill walking and FES. The FastFES intervention incorporates principles of physiology, biomechanics, motor control and learning, and predictions of forward-dynamic gait simulations to improve post-stroke gait.

The overall purpose of this protocol is to assess the biomechanical and neurophysiologic effects of rehabilitative strategies and protocols that are commonly used during physical therapy treatment of gait disorders post-stroke among two cohorts of people. Aim 1 of the study will assess the changes in gait biomechanics, corticospinal excitability, and walking function during 18 sessions of gait retraining, with participants in Cohort 1. Aim 2 of the study assesses the effect of parameters such as walking speed (slow, fast, variable, split-belt walking), functional electrical stimulation parameters (short-term changes induced by fast versus FastFES, stimulation intensity, number of muscles stimulated), and bio-feedback on within-session changes in gait biomechanics, walking function, and corticospinal excitability, among participants in Cohort 2.

Within Cohort 1, participants will receive identical treatment throughout the 18 training sessions (i.e. FastFES training). Within Cohort 2, participants will participate in 3 training sessions of both FastFES and fast walking training, with a 3-week break between the two types of training.","Inclusion Criteria:

We permitted patients to either use their own mask (due to low resources institutionally) or we provided a surgical/cloth mask (early on relied on donated cloth masks for patients). Patients were randomized to a control (no tape over the mask/nose) or to the intervention (placing tape over the bridge of the nose of the face mask). Patients were evaluated at 30- and 60- minute intervals to assess for proper mask usage.,"Study Design and Setting:

This study is a randomized control trial at Eskenazi Hospital ED from April 2020 until October 2020. Eskenazi Hospital is a busy, urban, academic hospital, level 1 trauma center, in downtown Indianapolis. Here we serve a racially diverse, underserved population, with over 100,000 annual ED visits. This work was approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board (protocol #2004425945).

Selection of Participants:

All patients presenting to the ED were screened for enrollment in this study by trained research personnel. All patients are required to wear facial coverings while in the ED, and after screening patients based on the exclusion criteria provided below, patients were offered enrollment in the study. Patients were randomly identified by their bed location in the ED via a random number generator. Patients were excluded from the study for: (1) pregnant; (2) prisoner; (3) not English or Spanish speaking (currently a large cohort of ethnic Latino/Latina/Hispanic are utilizing the ED and we can use interpreters to interpret for enrollment); (4) intoxicated or decompensated psychiatric illness; (5) presenting to the ED with a life-threatening condition; (6) allergic to standard tape and/or tegaderm. Patient consent was obtained if an individual agreed to participate in the study.

Interventions:

All patients included in this study were approached and offered enrollment in a study for addressing PPE. The control arm consisted of no active intervention, with the treatment arm placing standard surgical tape over the bridge of the nose to adhere the top of the mask to the bridge of the nose, thereby creating a physical barrier from removing the mask from the face. Patients were reevaluated at 30 minutes and 60 minutes after enrollment to assess for proper mask compliance.

Measurements: Assuming 50% current compliance, 58 patients per arm were needed to have an 80% power to detect a 25% difference assuming a two-sided chi-square test and alpha = 0.05.

Outcomes:

The primary outcome of this trial is proper mask utilization upon reevaluation at 30 and 60 minutes, with the mask at/under the chin, meanwhile completely covering the mouth and nose). Secondary outcomes of this trial were comparing the primary demographic and visit related covariates on initial screening, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, past medical history, social history, chief complaint, and disposition (admission vs. discharge).

Analysis:

Patient demographics and characteristics were compared between the control and treatment groups. To test for differences between groups, Microsoft excel statistical package was utilized, and the Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables.","Inclusion Criteria:

The expected outcome is that the enhanced recovery program will significantly reduce opioid utilization with comparable pain scores and patient satisfaction after anorectal surgery.","There is an opioid epidemic in the United States, and the epidemic continues to worsen. The rate of opioids prescribed, distributed, and deaths from opioid overdoses continue to increase steadily. Opioids also have the costs of abuse, dependence, diversion of unused medication, and can serve as a gateway to other illegal substances. Opioid use often begins with treatment of acute postoperative pain, and the surgical episode can be a 'gateway' to the opioid crisis. Opioids remain ubiquitous in patients undergoing surgical procedures. Among opioid-naïve patients, persistent use after surgery occurs in 6-10%.

Ambulatory surgery cases are rarely mentioned in the context of this public health crisis, but are a major contributor to the problem. Opioids are ubiquitous after ambulatory anorectal surgery and prescribed in large quantities, often several times more than what is needed or taken by patients. As patients take a fraction of the opioids prescribed, this adds to issues of opioid diversion. In colorectal surgery, ambulatory anorectal procedures are common and frequent procedures, with the potential to impact a large number of patients when implementing quality improvement.

The studies proposed herein are designed to assess the efficacy of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) in the assessment of sympathetic tone in these women, and the effectiveness of non-pharmacologic therapeutic interventions in improving participant metabolic, endocrine, reproductive, and psychological health.","Question 1: Can osteopathic structural assessment identify increased sympathetic tone in women with PCOS? Specific Aim 1: To use palpation of Chapman points and spinal viscerosomatic reflex regions to assess the presence and degree of increased sympathetic tone in women with PCOS.

Chapman points and viscerosomatic reflexes reflect visceral dysfunction and are mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, and can be a very useful clinical diagnostic tool. There is increased sympathetic tone in women with PCOS as well as in obese individuals, as previously determined by physiologic measures. Increased sympathetic tone in the study population will be assessed by osteopathic structural assessment and confirmed by physiologic measures of heart rate, heart rate variability, resting blood pressure, and blood pressure and heart rate recovery following exercise.

Hypothesis: Chapman points will be palpable at regions for the heart, adrenal glands, and ovaries to indicate hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and will correlate with physiologic evidence of increased sympathetic tone.

Hypothesis: Alterations of viscerosomatic reflexes associated with the heart, adrenal glands, and ovaries will reflect hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and will correlate with physiologic evidence of increased sympathetic tone.

Question 2: Can regular, sympathetic nervous system-targeted osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) improve endocrine and reproductive parameters, and sympathetic tone, in women with PCOS? Specific Aim 2: To use weekly manipulation of Chapman points and spinal regions associated with viscerosomatic reflexes in women with PCOS for improvement of endocrine and reproductive parameters, and sympathetic tone, after 3 months of treatment.

Chapman points and viscerosomatic reflexes are useful in diagnosis, and may be manipulated to restore somatovisceral health.

Hypothesis: Completion of 3 months of weekly manipulation of Chapman points and viscerosomatic reflexes will improve sympathetic tone (as assessed by both osteopathic structural assessment and physiologic parameters), androgen levels, and menstrual cycle length compared to women with PCOS and no intervention.

Question 3: Can regular yoga improve metabolic, endocrine, reproductive, and psychological parameters in women with PCOS? Specific Aim 3: To use thrice-weekly yoga practice with mindfulness techniques in women with PCOS to improve metabolic, endocrine, reproductive, and psychological parameters after 3 months of intervention.

The benefits of moderate and high-intensity aerobic activity on metabolic and overall health for women with PCOS have been reported, but the effects of low-impact exercise are less studied. Women with PCOS will participate in a yoga class with integrated mindfulness techniques 3 times per week for 3 months.

Hypothesis: Thrice weekly yoga intervention for 3 months will result in an improvement in androgen levels, fasting blood glucose, menstrual cycle length, and patient-reported anxiety, compared to women with PCOS and no intervention.","Inclusion Criteria:

Nantes University Hospital,OTHER,NCT04600479,Study on the Prevalence of Hepatitis C In a psychiatRic Population,Study on the Prevalence of Hepatitis C In a psychiatRic Population,"Viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis C, is a major public health issue. Nowadays, very few studies in France have evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis C in a psychiatric environment.

In 2019, at the time of new treatments for HCV, it therefore seems essential to update the available data by estimating the prevalence of chronic active hepatitis C in psychiatric population. In addition to an update of epidemiological data, it is of high importance to assess the effectiveness of the care pathway for patients in whom chronic active hepatitis C is diagnosed, including the cascade of care, currently too inefficient despite treatments that are themselves ultra-efficient. Indeed, it is essential that once hepatitis is detected, it is formally diagnosed, then that the patient actually starts care and is adherent to treatment (take his treatment according to the prescription and until the end: this implies that the patient accepts his or her illness and understands the value of the prescribed treatments), to hope to cure the infection.

In this context, the SaPHIR study will allow to test a systematic screening of patients in an adult psychiatric environment, through rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). The objective is to promote the adherence of patients, and to assess possible obstacles in order to optimize the screening (RDTs), diagnosis (confirmation of only positive RDTs by venous sampling) and care management circuits in routine practice. In addition, the study envisages a combined HCV-HBV-HIV screening, taking into account the cross-infection risk (same mode of contamination, same risk population, frequent co-infections, more severe liver pathology in case of co-infection, etc.), thus making it possible to take care of the patient as a whole.

Oxytocin is a hormone that exists naturally in the body and the brain, affecting a wide range of social behaviors and emotions. The investigators will study the effects of different treatments (3 doses of oxytocin and one dose of placebo) on brain functional connectivity at rest in patients with ASD, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Investigators also seek to study how the effects of oxytocin treatment can be affected by genetic, immune and environmental factors.","This study consists of investigating the effects of several doses of acute administration of intranasal oxytocin on brain activity in adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). There is increasing evidence for the role of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) in enhancing social skills in ASD. Nevertheless, there is still a need of determining target engagement for oxytocin's action on brain and behavior. Here, investigators are studying the effects of different doses of IN-OT on the modulation of behavioral outcomes and neural responses in a double blind crossover study in individuals with ASD.

The aims of the research are to:

1. Study the effects of IN-OT doses on the modulation of brain functional connectivity between key socio-emotional brain regions during resting state in ASD
2. Study the effects of IN-OT doses on the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity of key emotional and perceptual brain networks in response to social cues (such as faces)
3. Study the effects of IN-OT on the BOLD activity of brain regions during an interactive social environment (ball game) in ASD

Investigators will compare the neuroimaging and behavioral results of individuals with ASD to control healthy males who will receive intranasal placebo. Investigators are also investigating the role of genetic factors, behavioral or clinical sub-groups of ASD, immune and environmental factors in modulating the effect of IN-OT on brain and behavior.

Participants with ASD will undergo 4 clinical visits during which they receive various randomly assigned doses of intranasal oxytocin and placebo. Both participants and the experimenter will be blind to the type of the treatment administered.

There will be only one visit for healthy controls who will all receive placebo spray. The visit for healthy controls will be conducted in a single-blind design. The experimenter will be aware that the subject is receiving placebo. However, the participant will be told that he might receive oxytocin or placebo.","Inclusion Criteria for ASD Participants:

There is increasing evidence for the role of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) in enhancing social skills in ASD. Nevertheless, there is still a need of determining target engagement for oxytocin's action on brain and behavior. Here, investigators are studying the effects of different doses of IN-OT on the modulation of behavioral outcomes and neural responses in a double blind crossover study in individuals with ASD. The aims of the research are to: 1. Study the effects of IN-OT doses on the modulation of brain functional connectivity between key socio-emotional brain regions during resting state in ASD 2. Study the effects of IN-OT doses on the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activity of key emotional and perceptual brain networks in response to social cues (such as faces) 3. Study the effects of IN-OT on the BOLD activity of brain regions during an interactive social environment (ball game) in ASD Investigators will compare the neuroimaging and behavioral results of individuals with ASD to control healthy males who will receive intranasal placebo. Investigators are also investigating the role of genetic factors, behavioral or clinical sub-groups of ASD, immune and environmental factors in modulating the effect of IN-OT on brain and behavior. Participants with ASD will undergo 4 clinical visits during which they receive various randomly assigned doses of intranasal oxytocin and placebo. Both participants and the experimenter will be blind to the type of the treatment administered. There will be only one visit for healthy controls who will all receive placebo spray. The visit for healthy controls will be conducted in a single-blind design. The experimenter will be aware that the subject is receiving placebo. However, the participant will be told that he might receive oxytocin or placebo.

For lymphadenopathy of unknown origin, ESGE recommends performing EUS-TA (or alternatively endobronchial ultrasound \[EBUS\]-guided) if the patient management requires a pathological result and no superficial lymphadenopathy is easily accessible. Unfortunately, EUS-TA may sometimes be challenging or inconclusive, due to blood contamination or insufficient material.

EUS elastography (EUS-E) is a non-invasive ultrasound technique that measures the hardness of tissues. The level of hardness of region of interest (ROI) can be evaluated using qualitative scores and/or quantitative methods (strain ratio; SR).

To date, most of the studies on EUS-E have been carried out using the Hitachi ultrasound machine. In particular, Paterson performed a quantitative analysis considering as a pathological value cut-off, the SR ≥7.5 for EUS-E in the nodal staging of esophageal cancer. The study involved 53 LNs using cytology as gold standard: their data showed that EUS-E had a sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 96%, PPV of 95% and NPV of 86%.

Recently, a new compact ultrasound processor, EU-ME2 (Olympus SE \& CO. KG, Hamburg, Germany) that includes an elastography software was developed although data regarding its application in LNs evaluation are still not available. The concept of fractal geometry as a tool for describing natural objects was originally introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot. A fractal can be considered as an irregularly shaped object and that can be divided into fragments, each of them representing a self-similar reduced copy of the whole.

It has been demonstrated that fractal geometry can be used to efficiently evaluate the geometrical complexity of imaging patterns observed in oncology.

Duke University,OTHER,NCT04329702,Mobile Coping Skills Training to Improve Cardiorespiratory Failure Survivors' Psychological Distress,Optimizing a Self-directed Mobile Coping Skills Training Intervention to Improve Cardiorespiratory Failure Survivors' Psychological Distress,"This is a pilot randomized clinical trial involving adult survivors of cardiorespiratory failure treated in intensive care units (ICUs) that is designed to test the acceptability, feasibility, and clinical impact of a coping skills training intervention (Blueprint) delivered via a mobile app. This trial will allow us to determine if new changes to intervention delivery, inclusion criteria, and other factors are successful. It will also inform the development of a next-step efficacy focused trial.","As survival has improved for the 2 million people with cardiorespiratory failure managed annually in US intensive care units (ICUs), research has clarified how these survivors suffer from severe and persistent symptoms of psychological distress-depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-after discharge. However, few interventions exist that are relevant to patients' experiences and that also accommodate their many physical, social, and financial barriers to personalized care. To fill this gap, we developed a telephone- and web-based coping skills training (CST) program.

CST is an empirically-supported psychosocial intervention that targets the use of the adaptive coping skills to decrease psychological distress and improve quality of life. We conducted a multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) called CSTEP that compared CST to an education program (EP) among a general sample of ICU survivors who received mechanical ventilation for cardiorespiratory failure. CST reduced depression symptoms and improved quality of life at 6 months in a pre-specified subgroup with elevated baseline distress. This RCT also identified key questions regarding best practices for identifying patients who are highly distressed yet whose physical illness is manageable, as well as delivering the intervention in a more convenient, and scalable manner. In a recent RCT testing a mindfulness intervention (LIFT), we found that a self-directed mobile app approach increased dose, adherence, and retention. However, many patients reported low enthusiasm for a meditation-based intervention.

What is needed before a second multicenter RCT is to apply the promising CST content to a LIFT-inspired mobile app-based delivery system, and then to test it within a targeted patient population with a high likelihood of response (i.e., high baseline psychological distress). Therefore, we propose a 2-year R34 mixed-methods project that includes a pilot RCT in which we will randomize 45 cardiorespiratory failure / insufficiency survivors to one of three arms in equal ratios: intervention plus therapist for non-responders (n \~15), intervention without a therapist (n \~15), and usual care control (n \~15). Randomization will be stratified by ICU service (medical vs. surgical), baseline HADS score (\<14 vs. ≥14), and age (\<50 vs. ≥50). Our specific aims will: (1) Optimize the usability of a self-directed mobile app (Blueprint) and an automated post-discharge distress screening system; (2) Test two promising iterations of Blueprint vs. usual care in a pilot 3-arm RCT with 3-month follow up, and (3) Explore facilitators and barriers to Blueprint implementation, using these data to inform any necessary final revisions to the Blueprint app.","INCLUSION CRITERIA

Advancing Clinical Therapeutics Globally for HIV/AIDS and Other Infections,NETWORK,NCT00090779,Nine Month Course of Anti-HIV Medications for People Recently Infected With HIV,The SETPOINT Study - A Randomized Study of the Effect of Immediate Treatment With Potent Antiretroviral Therapy Versus Observation With Treatment as Indicated in Newly Infected HIV-1 Infected Subjects: Does Early Therapy After the Virologic Setpoint?,"Although some doctors favor starting anti-HIV treatment as soon as possible after patients learn they are infected, it is not known if treatment for recently infected patients results in long-term benefits or harm. The purpose of this study is to learn whether or not people should take anti-HIV drugs when they are first infected.","Combination antiretroviral therapy has resulted in significantly decreased morbidity and mortality, incidence of opportunistic infections, and hospitalizations in HIV infected people. However, because of long-term toxicities associated with long-term use of antiretrovirals and the persistence of virus in latent reservoirs, it is unclear when it is best to initiate therapy in recently infected individuals. This study compared the virologic outcomes of adults recently infected with HIV who received emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF), coformulated as Truvada, and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), coformulated as Kaletra \[immediate treatment (IT arm)\], with those who received no treatment \[deferred treatment (DT arm)\].

The original study lasted 96 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (IT arm vs. DT arm). For the first 36 weeks of the study, IT arm participants received FTC/TDF once daily and LPV/RTV twice daily. Some IT arm participants received a different ART regimen as determined by the participant and study staff, if appropriate. DT arm participants received no treatment for the duration of the study. At Week 37, participants from both arms were offered treatment continuation or initiation until Week 96 if they had a high viral load, low CD4 count, or experienced HIV-related symptoms (Step 2). Study visits occurred at screening, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 37, 38, 40, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Clinical assessment and blood collection occurred at all visits. Urine tests occurred at selected visits. Participants were asked to complete an adherence questionnaire at Weeks 12, 24, and 36.

Per the recommendations the DSMB review in June 2009, this protocol was terminated as originally written with the exception of those participants in the IT arm in the middle of the first 36 weeks of treatment. Those participants were to continue on treatment until the end of the 36 weeks. At that point treatment decisions were made on best practice guidelines. In addition, the study duration was extended to include a 5 year follow up of participants who did not initiate long-term antiretroviral therapy (Step 3).

The study was reviewed by an SMC on December 8, 2010. The SMC recommended the study close to long term follow-up because only very few participants enrolled in this portion of the study.

All the results except for the CD4 analysis and time to treatment initiation and deaths were based on the database frozen on July 2, 2009. The results for the CD4 analysis and time to treatment initiation and deaths were based on the database frozen on January 30, 2012.","Inclusion Criteria for Step 1:

Some IT arm participants received a different ART regimen as determined by the participant and study staff, if appropriate. DT arm participants received no treatment for the duration of the study. At Week 37, participants from both arms were offered treatment continuation or initiation until Week 96 if they had a high viral load, low CD4 count, or experienced HIV-related symptoms (Step 2). Study visits occurred at screening, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 37, 38, 40, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Clinical assessment and blood collection occurred at all visits. Urine tests occurred at selected visits. Participants were asked to complete an adherence questionnaire at Weeks 12, 24, and 36. Per the recommendations the DSMB review in June 2009, this protocol was terminated as originally written with the exception of those participants in the IT arm in the middle of the first 36 weeks of treatment. Those participants were to continue on treatment until the end of the 36 weeks. At that point treatment decisions were made on best practice guidelines. In addition, the study duration was extended to include a 5 year follow up of participants who did not initiate long-term antiretroviral therapy (Step 3). The study was reviewed by an SMC on December 8, 2010. The SMC recommended the study close to long term follow-up because only very few participants enrolled in this portion of the study. All the results except for the CD4 analysis and time to treatment initiation and deaths were based on the database frozen on July 2, 2009. The results for the CD4 analysis and time to treatment initiation and deaths were based on the database frozen on January 30, 2012.

King's College London,OTHER,NCT01608802,Outcomes for Antiretroviral Therapy Patients Receiving Palliative Care,Phase 3 Trial of Palliative Care for HIV Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy,"Despite overwhelming need for effective HIV palliative care in sub-Saharan Africa, a systematic appraisal of the literature found almost no outcome or evaluative evidence.

Aim:

The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of HIV palliative care training and a simple palliative care assessment tool provided to nurses of patients on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), and to evaluate this in terms of patient outcomes under clinical experimental conditions in 2 African countries using randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs.

Intervention being tested:

Within each well-established HIV ART clinic, patients will be randomly allocated to either continue receiving standard care (control group) or to receive standard care plus appointments with a clinic nurse trained in basic palliative care (intervention group).

Methods:

Design: Each Phase III clinical trial (i.e. one trial in each of 2 countries) will be powered and conducted in parallel to a common research design protocol, thus permitting evidence of outcomes that reflects 2 different ART providers, providing evidence of palliative care efficacy relevant to different HIV care settings.

Primary outcome: Each trial has been powered to a primary endpoint of pain control.

Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcomes are the core domains of palliative care as defined by the WHO (i.e. physical, including symptoms, psychological, social and spiritual) and measured by the APCA African POS. Further secondary outcomes measured will be: adherence to treatment; risk behaviours; health-related quality of life; psychological morbidity.

Inclusion: Patients will be screened and invited into the trial if they are on ART, score 3-5 on the 0-5 APCA African POS pain or symptom items, are 18 years or older, and can give informed consent to trial entry and data collection.

Analysis: An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted to determine treatment response differences between the two conditions. In order to maximise the efficiency of longitudinal data, multi-level modelling will be applied as appropriate.","Background / rationale Despite overwhelming need for effective HIV palliative care in sub-Saharan Africa (as evidenced by the epidemiology of primarily HIV and cancer), a systematic appraisal of the literature found almost no outcome or evaluative evidence. Further systematic reviews of palliative care and HIV palliative care effectiveness have found the evidence to have been generated mainly in high income countries, before the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the evidence from Africa to be of generally lower quality (i.e. non-trial data) with limited potential for inclusion in evidence-based health care planning and delivery. In order to influence clinical practice, policy and guidelines, it is essential to provide high quality trial evidence of the effectiveness of palliative care for people on ART. In order to achieve the goal of maximum coverage, the capacity building of existing HIV care services to provide palliative care to their patients seems the most feasible. Further, the evidence demonstrates that the pain and symptom burden of those on ART is not different to those not on ART, therefore a key role for palliative care may be in the support of those accessing treatment. Our proposed study will develop a model of care that extends palliative care delivery into existing HIV/ART delivery sites, offering a mechanism of greater coverage and feasibility than alternative approaches such as referral of all palliative care-related problems out to specialist external providers.

* Aim We aim to evaluate the efficacy of HIV palliative care training and a simple palliative care assessment tool provided to nurses of patients on ART, and to evaluate this in terms of patient outcomes under clinical experimental conditions in 2 African countries using randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs.
* Intervention being tested Within each well-established HIV ART clinic, patients will be randomly allocated to either continue receiving standard care (control group) or to receive standard care plus appointments with a clinic nurse trained in basic palliative care (intervention group). The intervention nurse will receive weekly supervision from a local palliative care service and will use a simple assessment form at each patient appointment.
* Methods Design: Each Phase III clinical trial (i.e. one trial in each of 2 countries) will be powered and conducted in parallel to a common research design protocol, thus permitting evidence of outcomes that reflects 2 different ART providers, providing evidence of palliative care efficacy relevant to different HIV care settings. Each of the 2 HIV care facilities (one in each of Kenya and South Africa) is a highly experienced HIV and ART care provider, with proven longevity. The providers of the palliative care training are longstanding experts in the delivery of both palliative care training and palliative care.

Primary outcome: Each trial has been powered to a primary endpoint of pain control.

Secondary outcomes: The secondary outcomes are the core domains of palliative care as defined by the WHO (i.e. physical, including symptoms, psychological, social and spiritual) and measured by the APCA African POS. Further secondary outcomes measured will be: adherence to treatment; risk behaviours; health-related quality of life; and an additional measure of psychological morbidity.

The primary and secondary outcomes are the same for each country's trial.

This study aims to reject the null hypothesis that receipt of palliative care in addition to standard care does not affect pain compared to those receiving standard care alone.

Inclusion: Patients will be screened and invited into the trial if they are on ART, score 3-5 on the 0-5 APCA African POS pain or symptom items, are 18 years or older, and can give informed consent to trial entry and data collection.

Analysis: An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted to determine treatment response differences between the two conditions. In order to maximise the efficiency of longitudinal data, multi-level modelling will be applied as appropriate.

- Outputs We have selected an RCT design, with multiple country partners, in order that outputs have maximum potential influence.

The revised CONSORT trial statement for non-drug trials has been applied to ensure potential publication in the leading 400 medical journals.

In terms of a clinical and policy audience for the findings, the inclusion of 2 partner countries enables us to demonstrate the efficacy of 2 providers of ART care (as there is much heterogeneity between HIV care providers in Africa), and to maximise the ability to replicate findings, while dissemination will describe and compare the two providers of care delivered.

In addition to journal publications, we intend to present summary outputs to relevant Country Teams / policy / advocacy stakeholders, to present to international HIV / palliative care conference audiences, and to provide a podcast of findings to be freely downloaded on the web.

Jagiellonian University,OTHER,NCT03622684,Progressive Muscle Relaxation According to Jacobson in Treatment of the Patients With Temporomandibular Joint Disorders,Progressive Muscle Relaxation According to Jacobson in Treatment of the Patients With Temporomandibular Joint Disorders,"Temporomandibular joint disorders are ranked third among the most common stomatological diseases after dental caries and periodontal problems. Type of dysfunction is determined by environmental, genetic and psycho-emotional factors. It has been observed that increasing level of stress leads to the increase of harmful parafunctional habits in the stomatognathic system whose long-term effect prevents the ability of the organism to compensate and adapt the function, which contributes to the pain within the masticatory system. Nowadays applied methods in treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders are still under investigation. However, they have not been developed effectively yet. Satisfactory methods of masticatory muscle relaxation (with the exception for drug treatment) are only related to mental patients. Significant impact factor and psycho-emotional stress in the etiology of dysfunction indicate the need of the routine approach in the treatment of patients with temporomandibular joint disorders to be changed. The attempt to cooperate with a psychologist may facilitate the effectiveness of traditional rehabilitation of patients with dysfunction.","Introduction In the 30s of the previous century, Edmund Jacobson developed the method of progressive muscle relaxation, which is based on the premise that mental relaxation should naturally result from physical relaxation. The primary objective of Jacobson's relaxation is to increase patient's awareness associated with the feeling of muscle tension, no matter how intense it is. This method teaches patients how to take control over the factors causing stress, with simultaneous relaxation of skeletal muscles, and alternating tension and relaxation deliberately in the next group of striated muscle. Regular training is aimed at developing a habit of locating the tension and loosening individual muscle groups. Data from the literature indicates the usefulness of Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation method as a supportive therapy for the treatment of neurological disorders, depression, anxiety, bronchial asthma, and cardiological conditions. Positive therapeutic results have also been reported in the treatment of peptic ulcer, chronic headache, tinnitus, sleep disorders, and psychological treatment of neurological conditions. The additional benefits of this therapeutic approach include reduced anxiety, decreased arterial hypertension and improved heart function, improved gastric and intestinal function, increased imagination and thought processes, increased trust between the patient and the physician, and improved control of one's mood. Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation has not been used in the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders. The above has become an inspiration to undertake research in this field. The significant impact of psycho-emotional factors and stress on the rise or worsening of dysfunction as well as cooperation with the psychologist can significantly influence the course and treatment of functional disorders. The elimination of psychological components in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders may contribute to the reduction of pain and frequency of parafunctional habits.

The aim of the study was to obtain data, documented test results as to the efficiency of progressive muscle relaxation in the treatment of pain caused by temporomandibular joint disorders, as a supplement to previous methods using occlusal splint and other physical therapies. The study also included the treatment of post-isometric muscle relaxation. In order to ensure an objective comparative evaluation of these two methods of adjunctive treatment, clinical studies and surveys were conducted. The aim of the study was to answer the following questions:

1. Does the use of Jacobson's progressive relaxation method will be beneficial to reduce pain and improve the functioning of the stomatognathic system being evaluated in clinical trials?
2. Does the relaxation method obtain a positive opinion of the patients and can complement the previously used prosthetic rehabilitation with occlusal splint as well as other physical therapies?
3. Which one of assessed methods (progressive muscle relaxation according to Jacobson and method of post- isometric relaxation) gains an advantage in the treatment used in the adjunctive therapy of temporomandibular joint disorders, and assessment of which according to their impact on muscle relaxation on the basis of the clinical trial and the results of the survey? Material and Methods The study included 100 patients of both sexes, aged from 20 to 35 years who were diagnosed with pain due to temporomandibular joint disorders accompanied with high muscle tension of masticatory muscles. The study included patients reported to prosthetic treatment to Department of Prosthodontics at the Jagiellonian University, Medical College in Krakow between 2014 and 2016. Patients were divided into two groups of 50 people each. In the group number I-test group, treatment was performed by progressive muscle relaxation according to Jacobson. In the group number II- control group, post-isometric muscle relaxation treatment was instituted. The following criteria the patients had to meet in order to be included in the study: good general health, painful form of temporomandibular joint disorders with high muscle tension, pain lasting for at least 3 weeks prior to admission, and also patients with full arches without previous orthodontic treatment.

The exclusion criteria included: joint component of functional disorders (pain in the temporomandibular joints, acoustic symptoms), deterioration of the posture resulting from relaxation training (aggravation of muscular pain, worsening of mental state) unstable musculoskeletal system (frequent painful muscle spasms), tetanus, other diseases that prevent the patient from continuing the study (fever), and the lack of the patient's informed consent.

The criterion for the allocation of patients to groups I and II was the consent to perform relaxation treatments for the treatment of functional disorders of the chewing organ and the lack of contraindications.

Relaxation therapy schedule was adapted to clinical and laboratory stages of occlusion splint. For the purposes of the research both physiotherapy and pharmacological treatment were eliminated. Following the purpose of the studies, comparative evaluation of two supporting methods of treatment were undertaken: for the patients with temporomandibular joint disorders, the performance of 5 cycles of progressive muscle relaxation according to Jacobson in the group I - the study one, and 5 cycles of post- isometric muscle relaxation in group II - control. The qualification and assignment of the patients into group I and II were based on the results of clinical and specialist examination. In group I the training was held twice a week and was conducted by a qualified psychologist. Each meeting lasted 45 minutes. The procedure was to tighten the subsequent muscle groups for 5-7 seconds, followed by a 20-second relaxation time. The basic part of the training performed during the first two meetings included alternating tension and relaxation of muscles in the limbs, abdomen and face based on Jacobson's classic training. The next session was modified taking into account the muscles of the neck and face, and the fourth and fifth sessions included exercises with which the patient was familiarized during earlier training, but done separately for each part of the face.In group II the treatment was conducted by a qualified physiotherapist and also was held twice a week, 45 minutes each, and next exercises were repeated three times.","Inclusion Criteria:

Introduction In the 30s of the previous century, Edmund Jacobson developed the method of progressive muscle relaxation, which is based on the premise that mental relaxation should naturally result from physical relaxation. The primary objective of Jacobson's relaxation is to increase patient's awareness associated with the feeling of muscle tension, no matter how intense it is. This method teaches patients how to take control over the factors causing stress, with simultaneous relaxation of skeletal muscles, and alternating tension and relaxation deliberately in the next group of striated muscle. Regular training is aimed at developing a habit of locating the tension and loosening individual muscle groups. Data from the literature indicates the usefulness of Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation method as a supportive therapy for the treatment of neurological disorders, depression, anxiety, bronchial asthma, and cardiological conditions. Positive therapeutic results have also been reported in the treatment of peptic ulcer, chronic headache, tinnitus, sleep disorders, and psychological treatment of neurological conditions. The additional benefits of this therapeutic approach include reduced anxiety, decreased arterial hypertension and improved heart function, improved gastric and intestinal function, increased imagination and thought processes, increased trust between the patient and the physician, and improved control of one's mood. Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation has not been used in the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders. The above has become an inspiration to undertake research in this field. The significant impact of psycho-emotional factors and stress on the rise or worsening of dysfunction as well as cooperation with the psychologist can significantly influence the course and treatment of functional disorders. The elimination of psychological components in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders may contribute to the reduction of pain and frequency of parafunctional habits. The aim of the study was to obtain data, documented test results as to the efficiency of progressive muscle relaxation in the treatment of pain caused by temporomandibular joint disorders, as a supplement to previous methods using occlusal splint and other physical therapies. The study also included the treatment of post-isometric muscle relaxation. In order to ensure an objective comparative evaluation of these two methods of adjunctive treatment, clinical studies and surveys were conducted. The aim of the study was to answer the following questions: 1. Does the use of Jacobson's progressive relaxation method will be beneficial to reduce pain and improve the functioning of the stomatognathic system being evaluated in clinical trials? 2. Does the relaxation method obtain a positive opinion of the patients and can complement the previously used prosthetic rehabilitation with occlusal splint as well as other physical therapies? 3. Which one of assessed methods (progressive muscle relaxation according to Jacobson and method of post- isometric relaxation) gains an advantage in the treatment used in the adjunctive therapy of temporomandibular joint disorders, and assessment of which according to their impact on muscle relaxation on the basis of the clinical trial and the results of the survey? Material and Methods The study included 100 patients of both sexes, aged from 20 to 35 years who were diagnosed with pain due to temporomandibular joint disorders accompanied with high muscle tension of masticatory muscles. The study included patients reported to prosthetic treatment to Department of Prosthodontics at the Jagiellonian University, Medical College in Krakow between 2014 and 2016. Patients were divided into two groups of 50 people each. In the group number I-test group, treatment was performed by progressive muscle relaxation according to Jacobson. In the group number II- control group, post-isometric muscle relaxation treatment was instituted. The following criteria the patients had to meet in order to be included in the study: good general health, painful form of temporomandibular joint disorders with high muscle tension, pain lasting for at least 3 weeks prior to admission, and also patients with full arches without previous orthodontic treatment. The exclusion criteria included: joint component of functional disorders (pain in the temporomandibular joints, acoustic symptoms), deterioration of the posture resulting from relaxation training (aggravation of muscular pain, worsening of mental state) unstable musculoskeletal system (frequent painful muscle spasms), tetanus, other diseases that prevent the patient from continuing the study (fever), and the lack of the patient's informed consent. The criterion for the allocation of patients to groups I and II was the consent to perform relaxation treatments for the treatment of functional disorders of the chewing organ and the lack of contraindications. Relaxation therapy schedule was adapted to clinical and laboratory stages of occlusion splint. For the purposes of the research both physiotherapy and pharmacological treatment were eliminated. Following the purpose of the studies, comparative evaluation of two supporting methods of treatment were undertaken: for the patients with temporomandibular joint disorders, the performance of 5 cycles of progressive muscle relaxation according to Jacobson in the group I - the study one, and 5 cycles of post- isometric muscle relaxation in group II - control. The qualification and assignment of the patients into group I and II were based on the results of clinical and specialist examination. In group I the training was held twice a week and was conducted by a qualified psychologist. Each meeting lasted 45 minutes. The procedure was to tighten the subsequent muscle groups for 5-7 seconds, followed by a 20-second relaxation time. The basic part of the training performed during the first two meetings included alternating tension and relaxation of muscles in the limbs, abdomen and face based on Jacobson's classic training. The next session was modified taking into account the muscles of the neck and face, and the fourth and fifth sessions included exercises with which the patient was familiarized during earlier training, but done separately for each part of the face.In group II the treatment was conducted by a qualified physiotherapist and also was held twice a week, 45 minutes each, and next exercises were repeated three times. Inclusion Criteria: 1. good general health 2. painful form of temporomandibular joint disorders- masticatory muscles pain with high muscle tension 3. pain lasting for at least 3 weeks prior to admission 4. patients with full arches without previous orthodontic treatment.

University of Valencia,OTHER,NCT05592184,Dual Task During Resistance Training in CTR,Dual Task During Resistance Training in Patients With Carpal Tunnel Release,"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a highly prevalent peripheral compressive neuropathy of the upper extremity. CTS is characterised by the presence of pain, tingling sensations and paraesthesia in the median nerve territory. Symptom severity and pain are commonly modulated by psychosocial factors (e.g. catastrophic thinking and kinesiophobia).

The objective of this study will be (1) to evaluate the effect of dual-task on the maximum number of repetitions possible and pain during rubber band training in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome undergoing surgery; (2) to determine the influence of psychosocial factors on the response to dual-task exercise.

Patients will voluntarily participate in the study, which will be conducted at the Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, during the months of November 2022 to December 2022. All participants will be informed of the aims and content of the research and written informed consent will be obtained. The study will conform to the Declaration of Helsinki and will be approved by the local ethics committee.

The experimental protocol begins with the assessment of self-perceived pain intensity and perceived exertion when using different intensities of elastic resistance, during wrist flexion and extension, at a controlled speed of 1.5sec/ phase. To assess the intensity at which they will work, participants will perform 2 repetitions and will be allowed a rest of 60s between sets until they obtain a score of 3 on the Borg CR10 scale. For this purpose, 1.5 m long elastic bands, pre-stretched to approximately 25% of their initial length, in yellow, red, green, blue, black, silver and gold (TheraBand CLX, The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH, USA), will be progressively used starting from the lowest available elastic resistance (i.e. yellow). This intensity is selected because it appears to correspond to a resistance equivalent to 30% of 1RM and is considered a light intensity. Exercises should be performed with the subject's available ROM. Participants are asked to move their body and trunk as little as possible and to perform the exercise smoothly, without stopping or accelerating. The exercise will be performed in a seated position, with the back supported by the backrest and the forearm resting on a table, with the shoulders and elbows bent at 90 grades, leaving the wrist free, with the elastic bands held under the feet (stepping on them).

During the week of familiarisation and analysis of acute effects, subjects will attend 2 sessions, separated by 2 rest days in between, where they will perform 2 conditions/session (4 conditions in total at the end of the study), in a counterbalanced manner, with 10 minutes rest between each condition: 1) perform the highest number of wrist flexion repetitions with the appropriate resistance; 2) perform the highest number of wrist flexion repetitions with the appropriate band, and following a dual task; 3) perform the highest number of wrist extension repetitions with the appropriate band; 4) perform the highest number of wrist extension repetitions with the appropriate band, and following a dual task.

The dual task will be self-regulated and will consist of subtracting 3 by 3 from 100, and performing the maximum number of repetitions possible. The subject will perform the mathematical operation aloud, without being corrected, but if they get stuck on a number or operation, they will have to be told to continue subtracting from that number or from another, so that they do not stop performing the operations. At the end of each condition, the subject will be asked about the perceived difficulty of the self-regulated mathematical task (where 0 is not difficult at all and 10 is the maximum difficulty), and the maximum number of repetitions performed will be recorded. The pressure points and VAS will then be measured again.

After the familiarisation week and the analysis of acute effects, subjects will be randomly distributed into two conditions: 1) exercise with dual task; 2) exercise without dual task. The exercises performed will be the same as during the familiarisation week, as well as the guidelines for performing them.

"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",OTHER,NCT02428179,Impact of Structured Communication in the OR on Surgical Site Infections: Prospective Observational Clinical Trial,StOP?-Trial: Impact of Structured Communication in the OR on Surgical Site Infections: Prospective Observational Clinical Trial,"Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most frequent complication in patients that undergo abdominal surgery. A previous prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing elective open abdominal procedures showed that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI whereas case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for incisional SSI. Therefore, the introduction of a clinical applicable intervention ""structured briefing using the StOP protocol"" has been developed and was tested in pilot experiments. This intervention aims at improving case-relevant communication during the procedure and to reduce excess case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation.

The hypothesis is: structured briefings during an operation reduce the incidence of SSI after surgery.","Background

A number of publications has shown a relatively high rate of complications that are related to the treatment and not to the disease. Such iatrogenic incidents are an important influence on patient morbidity and increase healthcare costs. Therefore, patient safety and minimizing the risk of iatrogenic harm has become a major concern in healthcare. Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most frequent complication in patients that undergo surgery, leading to considerable costs.

In a previous study, the investigators established an empirical relationship between communication during surgery and SSI was shown in a prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing major elective open abdominal procedures. An analysis of 11383 communication events observed by a team of trained work psychologists showed a relationship between intraoperative communication and SSI. Adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that more case-relevant communication during the entire procedure was associated with a significant reduction in organ/space SSI (odds ratio 0.861, 95% confidence interval 0.750-0.987; P=0.034). Interestingly, case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure was associated with a significant increase of incisional SSI (odds ratio 1.1153, 95% confidence interval 1.040-1.196; P=0.002). Distractors such as noise and traffic were also assessed but had no effect on SSI. The current study is based on these observations, which reveal that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI and case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for SSI.

These findings can be interpreted in light of previous studies assessing communication in surgery and similar collaborative tasks which showed that explicit task-relevant communication fosters the development of a shared mental model of the task within the team. This facilitates coordination, because all team members are informed about the state of task progress, and can better anticipate their contribution. This is particularly important in critical phases of the procedure, as well as in OR teams composed of members with different levels of knowledge and expertise. Explicit task-related communication may be particularly useful to inform non-sterile team members (anesthetists, scrub nurses) that do not have full sight of the operative field at all times.

Although case-irrelevant communication in surgical teams has been found to foster a positive team-climate, it can be seen as a distractor if it diverts the attention away from the main task. This is more likely during the closing phase (last 20 minutes), because for most of the team members, the central task is already finished, and clearing and cleaning are routine tasks. If during routine tasks the team engages in too much non-patient relevant communication, attention to the closure may be diverted.

Given the previously found results, the introduction of a clinically applicable intervention (described below) has been tested in pilot studies. This intervention aims to assure a short discussion of case-relevant aspects at specific moments of the procedure, draw the attention of the on case-relevant communication during the main phase and to prevent a high increase in case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation.

Objective

To perform a prospective clinical trial to test the impact of structured intraoperative briefings on SSI. The incidence of SSIs will be compared before and after the introduction of this intervention.

- Intraoperative briefings: First briefing: after exposure of the organ of interest, Second briefing: Intraoperative briefing before closure of the operative field.

University of Alabama at Birmingham,OTHER,NCT02442479,Maximizing Mechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy to Combat Sarcopenia in Older Adults,Maximizing Mechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy to Combat Sarcopenia in Older Adults,"Resistance training has shown the most promise among interventions aimed to combat aging muscle atrophy as it enhances strength, power, and mobility function, but induces varying degrees of skeletal muscle hypertrophy as the investigators demonstrated in the initial 5-year funding period of this award (2001-2006). In the subsequent 5-year funding period (2007-2012), the investigators built on this prior work by using a dose-response approach in older adults - ultimately to optimize the treatment of age-related muscle atrophy. The investigators tested four, long-term resistance training prescriptions in older (60-75 yr) women and men to determine which prescription maximizes mechanisms driving muscle regrowth. One of the innovations in this project was the use of a 4-wk pre-training program to reach a plateau in the early, non-muscle mass adaptations, thereby establishing a true baseline from which both mechanisms of measurable muscle hypertrophy and functional consequences of hypertrophy could be studied in a tightly integrated fashion without bias in the subsequent experimental period. A randomized design was used to test the overarching hypothesis that a novel program of mixed strength and power training would optimize the anabolic environment to promote muscle hypertrophy and robust gains in performance.

In the subsequent 5-year funding period (2007-2012), we built on this prior work by using a dose-response approach in older adults - ultimately to optimize the treatment of age-related muscle atrophy. We tested four, long-term resistance training prescriptions in older (60-75 yr) women and men to determine which prescription maximizes mechanisms driving muscle regrowth (protein synthesis and myonuclear addition).

A randomized design was used to test the overarching hypothesis that a novel program of mixed strength and power training would optimize the anabolic environment to promote muscle hypertrophy and robust gains in performance. This hypothesis was tested with three specific aims.

Specific Aim 1. We determined the effects of manipulating intensity, recovery, and mode of contraction on rates of muscle hypertrophy and muscle mass-dependent improvements in tests of in vivo muscle performance among older women and men. In brief, the four training models were: (1) traditional high-resistance concentric-eccentric training (H) 3 d/wk (HHH3); (2) high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 2 d/wk (HH2); (3) 3 d/wk mixed model consisting of high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 2 d/wk separated by 1 bout of low-resistance, high-velocity, concentric only training (L) (HLH3); and (4) 2 d/wk mixed model consisting of high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 1 d/wk and low-resistance, high-velocity, concentric only training 1 d/wk (HL2). For Aim 1, we hypothesized that the HLH3 prescription would prove optimal overall for combined gains in muscle mass, strength, power, and fatigue resistance in both women and men, while HL2 would be the least effective program due to insufficient weekly loading.

Specific Aim 2. Myofiber hypertrophy requires net muscle protein synthesis, and advanced fiber expansion is facilitated by nuclear addition. We are conducting a comprehensive evaluation of: (1) key regulatory steps in the protein synthesis/degradation machinery; and (2) myonuclear addition and satellite cell activation/cell cycle regulation. Quantitative relationships between metabolic/molecular responses and the magnitude of muscle hypertrophy among older adults will enable us to identify underlying factors that respond differently to these four resistance training models, potentially in a gender-specific manner, thus revealing important processes that drive the hypertrophy adaptation. We hypothesized that muscle protein synthesis and myonuclear addition, along with key underlying regulatory processes, would be most favorably affected by the work-recovery cycle of 2 d/wk high-resistance loading (HLH3 and HH2 models), thereby optimizing the anabolic environment for muscle hypertrophy in both older women and men.

Specific Aim 3. To translate the findings under Aim 1 to clinically important outcomes, we determined the degree to which non-traditional resistance training programs lead to improvements in mobility function and weight-bearing exercise difficulty. We hypothesized that a less stressful weekly training regimen consisting of fewer high-resistance contractions (HLH3) and/or fewer training sessions (HH2) while achieving substantial hypertrophy would promote equal or better improvements in mobility function and weight-bearing exercise difficulty than the traditionally prescribed HHH3 program.","Inclusion Criteria:

The investigators will obtain additional consent from participants in these family conferences who are not otherwise enrolled in the study. Second, after completion of the 3-month follow-up interview, a sub-sample of a different 30 families (again, 15 in each group) will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews to debrief about their experience in the study and the intervention (for those in that group). This will be a one-time interview scheduled within 60 days of recruitment for this part of the project.

Clinica Gema Leon,OTHER,NCT07074184,Radiofrequency Intervention in Post-COVID-19 Patients With Musculoskeletal Sequelae,Radiofrequency Intervention in Musculoskeletal Pathologies Post COVID-19,"The sequelae that occur in post-COVID-19 patients are multiple and, at a therapeutic level, these represent a new challenge within the general context of the pandemic that the world is suffering.

The virus has managed to end thousands of lives today and many other cases are being charged as directly responsible for a multiplicity of multisystem damages that need to be diagnosed and treated. Among the most relevant, are those that can affect to levels musculoskeletal in patients without previous pathologies, and in patients at risk who already had a pathology prior to infection.

On the other hand, signs and symptoms have been observed characteristic in the organ systems described above in post-contagion patients, directly associated with sequelae SARV-CoV2. The radiofrequency (RF) of electromagnetic waves represents a technology of proven efficacy and safety in multiple fields of both human and veterinary medicine. These include neurological and pneumological pathologies, and very especially those that affect the locomotor system. In therapeutics there are different RF modalities depending on the modality, polarity, type of signal and frequency, which in turn translate into different therapeutic profiles, clinical indications, efficacy and safety.

Among the RF technologies most used today and that have a greater scientific background, is the one known as Resistive Capacitive Monopolar Radio Frequency at 448 kHz (INDIBA®). This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of RFMCR in the treatment of musculoskeletal sequelae in patients presenting this type of pathologies that appear after contagion by COVID-19. Through this non-invasive technique, the investigators want to show that RF can help the physical rehabilitation of these patients through metabolic stimulation, increased vascularization and oxygenation of directly affected tissues, effects of deep hyperthermia generated by the interaction of the current with the treated biological substrate, as well as the activation of tissue regeneration, the result of subthermal action. It is thus intended to improve signs such as global muscle capacity, which is essential for the recovery of the post-COVID-19 patients.

The hypothesis of this study is that current post-COVID-19 treatments can be significantly improved in order to prevent complications and ensure the patients' well-being.","The new post-pandemic era has left sequelae in patients who presented the signs and symptoms of SARV-CoV2 and subsequently faced a positive for COVID-19. Such sequelae will be evident at various systemic levels of the affected patienta in the short, medium and long term future. One of these levels is musculoskeletal complications and injuries that have been documented throughout all scientific research since the beginning of massive infections worldwide.

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by penetrating the respiratory route (mostly), by fluid contact, and to a lesser extent, through the ocular pathway. In the field of neurology system, different forms of RF, nerve infiltrations, lymph node injuries, plantar fasciitis, spinal (peripheral) nerve disorders, etc. have been documented.

If the investigators focus on one of the most prevalent symptoms (those that affect the respiratory system), the bibliography that endorses that the RF could improve has been referenced.

The aim of this study is to assess the potential benefits of RF in patients with musculoskeletal problems which started after SARV-CoV-2 infection. The work proposed here aims to demonstrate the advantages of establishing RF as an excellent treatment for post-COVID-19 sequelae, due to its ability to reinforce immune action, modulate the inflammatory response and activate cellular and tissue regeneration.

The specific objectives of this research work are:

To demonstrate the efficacy of RF as a therapy in musculoskeletal pathologies derived from the sequelae of COVID-19.

To evidence and document the effects generated by the treatment with RF in the musculoskeletal system.

To estimate the level of benefit from RF in the musculoskeletal system treated and define the benefit/risk ratio.

To present and validate the therapy for the injuries under study that show significant improvements.

REGULATIONS

This clinical study will be carried out in accordance with the protocol, the principles established in the current revised version of the Declaration of Helsinki (Fortaleza, 2013) and in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements.

The researcher is aware, when signing the protocol, of the obligation to adhere to the instructions and procedures described in it, and will ensure that the established provisions are strictly adhered to.

The study will not begin until the approval of the Research Ethics Committee has been obtained.

The principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, the informed consent document, and any other information that is presented or facilitated to the possible subjects is reviewed and approved by the CEI. The Researcher agrees to allow direct access to the REC to all relevant documents.

INFORMED CONSENT.

In this case, patients must give their consent prior to being included in the study. The content and the procedure for obtaining it must be in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.

The investigator is responsible for obtaining the written informed consent of each patient participating in this study, after having explained in an understandable way, the nature, objectives, methods, expected benefits and possible risks of the study. The investigator must also explain to them that patients are completely free to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for whatever reason.

The study patients will give their consent, signing the corresponding model. For this purpose, each informed consent must be signed by both the investigator and the patient.

CONFIDENTIALITY.

All information related to the study is considered confidential in compliance with the confidentiality and custody of the data collected, in accordance with the 3/2018 Law on the protection of personal data (LOPDGDD), (article 5). Article 5.1 .f) of the RGPD states that personal data will be treated in such a way as to guarantee confidentiality and integrity In order to guarantee the confidentiality of the study data, only the main researcher and her team of collaborators will have access to it, the CEI and the pertinent health authorities.

FINANCING

The financing is assumed by the Gema León Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinic. There is no direct economic consideration for this, although there is a dedication of time and work by the team of physiotherapists (social security, payroll, personal income tax, etc.) that is not economically remunerated and is assumed or absorbed this way. In addition, the RF technology (equipment and accessories) will be provided by the company INDIBA S.A., through a temporary assignment without any financial compensation either from the Gema León Physiotherapy Clinic, or from any patient. The treatment of these is completely free for them.

The patient must travel to the clinic facilities and it is the researcher who will be responsible for the treatment in it.

No difficulties are foreseen in its performance since it will be carried out using a schedule adapted to the patient that allows the study to be monitored.

It is intended to carry out a longitudinal study with the participation of 99 patients with elbow musculoskeletal pathology, who confirmed a positive test for COVID-19. The sample size for our study is large enough to detect a clinically important difference in the primary outcome (s). For this, the investigators reviewed references at the bibliographic level, in which paired studies obtained a statistically significant value, being able to support our study. If the sample size was insufficient but statistically significant, the investigators would resort to expanding the sample. The division of the sample is carried out at random within the established groups.

The patients will be divided into three groups: Group A or Placebo Group, which received the treatment with the machine turned off. Radiofrequency 448 Hz was administered to the affected area in two phases, depending on the electrode applied: 10 minutes of capacitive electrode and 35 minutes of resistive electrode, both with the machine turned off. Group B or Mixed Group, treatment with manual therapy and radiofrequency. Radiofrequency 448 Hz was administered to the affected area in two phases, depending on the electrode applied: 5 minutes of capacitive electrode and 25 minutes of resistive electrode. In addition, a specific joint physical therapy manual therapy treatment was also performed, in which pumping techniques were performed after the radiofrequency treatment.Group C or Manual Group, to which conventional manual therapy was applied for each case. Articulatory pumping techniques were applied towards the painful position with the aim of reducing it.

Thus we compare the therapies of groups A, B and C, of Musculoskeletal Pathologies.

All groups will be evaluated at the beginning, a second evaluation after 3 weeks and a third final control after 12 sessions. A fourth evaluation will be carried out after the last and final evaluation, 6 weeks after finishing the treatment. Each of the participants will be informed of the study, the objective, its possible benefits and the side effects that could arise. A) Therefore, each patient must give their free and confirmed consent through signature. Among the items in the methodology, the following stand out:

Primary data parameters: A series of questions will be asked to each of the patients about the conditions diagnosed during the disease and those suffered after the infection that are directly related to abnormalities to be assessed.

Secondary Data Parameters: The therapeutic protocol will be executed in the facilities of the Gema León Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinic (Cordoba, Spain). Such RF therapeutic protocol will be implemented by application with an INDIBA® Activ device, whose function is to reduce inflammation, stimulate immunity and promote tissue regeneration. This will consist of a 30-minute treatment, composed by 5 minutes of treatment with the capacitive electrode and 25 minutes of the resistive electrode. A total of 12 sessions will be scheduled (two per week), and all processes will be documented from the beginning of therapy (the resources used will be provided by INDIBA and the Gema León Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinic, whose supervision will be carried out by the direction of both).

Dependent Variables: variables of nominal type such as sex, age, vaccination, number of days with symptoms, type of symptom will be created. The patients will be grouped into 3 groups of 33 participants each (99 in total):

Group A or Placebo Group, which received the treatment with the machine turned off. Radiofrequency 448 Hz was administered to the affected area in two phases, depending on the electrode applied: 10 minutes of capacitive electrode and 35 minutes of resistive electrode, both with the machine turned off.

Group B or Mixed Group, treatment with manual therapy and radiofrequency. Radiofrequency 448 Hz was administered to the affected area in two phases, depending on the electrode applied: 5 minutes of capacitive electrode and 25 minutes of resistive electrode. In addition, a specific joint physical therapy manual therapy treatment was also performed, in which pumping techniques were performed after the radiofrequency treatment.

Group C or Manual Group, to which conventional manual therapy was applied for each case. Articulatory pumping techniques were applied towards the painful position with the aim of reducing it.

Independent Variables: In order to compare the variables between groups, different methods of pain threshold and function of the mentioned systems will be used, such as: Global Functionality Scale (GAF), Katz Index for Independence, Lawton and Brody Scale of Basic Activities, Barthel index for disability, European Quality of Life 5-D Questionnaire (EURO- QoL 5-D) for quality of life, Tinetti test for gait and balance, joint amplitude scale measured with the goniometer (goniometry), strength muscle dynamometer (Dynamometry), pain index (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), reflectivity measurement with the Wartenberg Scale for bone tendon reflexes (ROTs), examination of sensitivity from evaluation of dermatomes. The statistical analysis is based on variables of nominal type mostly, which are suitable for the Chi square test with a significance value of 95% for the results (p \<0.05). However, if there are numerical data that must be compared between groups, the analysis will be used for ANOVA test with the same significance value for the comparison between results.","Inclusion Criteria:

The virus has managed to end thousands of lives today and many other cases are being charged as directly responsible for a multiplicity of multisystem damages that need to be diagnosed and treated. Among the most relevant, are those that can affect to levels musculoskeletal in patients without previous pathologies, and in patients at risk who already had a pathology prior to infection. On the other hand, signs and symptoms have been observed characteristic in the organ systems described above in post-contagion patients, directly associated with sequelae SARV-CoV2. The radiofrequency (RF) of electromagnetic waves represents a technology of proven efficacy and safety in multiple fields of both human and veterinary medicine. These include neurological and pneumological pathologies, and very especially those that affect the locomotor system. In therapeutics there are different RF modalities depending on the modality, polarity, type of signal and frequency, which in turn translate into different therapeutic profiles, clinical indications, efficacy and safety. Among the RF technologies most used today and that have a greater scientific background, is the one known as Resistive Capacitive Monopolar Radio Frequency at 448 kHz (INDIBA®). This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of RFMCR in the treatment of musculoskeletal sequelae in patients presenting this type of pathologies that appear after contagion by COVID-19. Through this non-invasive technique, the investigators want to show that RF can help the physical rehabilitation of these patients through metabolic stimulation, increased vascularization and oxygenation of directly affected tissues, effects of deep hyperthermia generated by the interaction of the current with the treated biological substrate, as well as the activation of tissue regeneration, the result of subthermal action. It is thus intended to improve signs such as global muscle capacity, which is essential for the recovery of the post-COVID-19 patients. The hypothesis of this study is that current post-COVID-19 treatments can be significantly improved in order to prevent complications and ensure the patients' well-being. The new post-pandemic era has left sequelae in patients who presented the signs and symptoms of SARV-CoV2 and subsequently faced a positive for COVID-19. Such sequelae will be evident at various systemic levels of the affected patienta in the short, medium and long term future. One of these levels is musculoskeletal complications and injuries that have been documented throughout all scientific research since the beginning of massive infections worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by penetrating the respiratory route (mostly), by fluid contact, and to a lesser extent, through the ocular pathway. In the field of neurology system, different forms of RF, nerve infiltrations, lymph node injuries, plantar fasciitis, spinal (peripheral) nerve disorders, etc. have been documented. If the investigators focus on one of the most prevalent symptoms (those that affect the respiratory system), the bibliography that endorses that the RF could improve has been referenced. The aim of this study is to assess the potential benefits of RF in patients with musculoskeletal problems which started after SARV-CoV-2 infection. The work proposed here aims to demonstrate the advantages of establishing RF as an excellent treatment for post-COVID-19 sequelae, due to its ability to reinforce immune action, modulate the inflammatory response and activate cellular and tissue regeneration. The specific objectives of this research work are: To demonstrate the efficacy of RF as a therapy in musculoskeletal pathologies derived from the sequelae of COVID-19. To evidence and document the effects generated by the treatment with RF in the musculoskeletal system. To estimate the level of benefit from RF in the musculoskeletal system treated and define the benefit/risk ratio. To present and validate the therapy for the injuries under study that show significant improvements. REGULATIONS This clinical study will be carried out in accordance with the protocol, the principles established in the current revised version of the Declaration of Helsinki (Fortaleza, 2013) and in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. The researcher is aware, when signing the protocol, of the obligation to adhere to the instructions and procedures described in it, and will ensure that the established provisions are strictly adhered to. The study will not begin until the approval of the Research Ethics Committee has been obtained. The principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, the informed consent document, and any other information that is presented or facilitated to the possible subjects is reviewed and approved by the CEI. The Researcher agrees to allow direct access to the REC to all relevant documents. INFORMED CONSENT. In this case, patients must give their consent prior to being included in the study. The content and the procedure for obtaining it must be in accordance with all applicable legal requirements. The investigator is responsible for obtaining the written informed consent of each patient participating in this study, after having explained in an understandable way, the nature, objectives, methods, expected benefits and possible risks of the study. The investigator must also explain to them that patients are completely free to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for whatever reason. The study patients will give their consent, signing the corresponding model. For this purpose, each informed consent must be signed by both the investigator and the patient. CONFIDENTIALITY. All information related to the study is considered confidential in compliance with the confidentiality and custody of the data collected, in accordance with the 3/2018 Law on the protection of personal data (LOPDGDD), (article 5). Article 5.1 .f) of the RGPD states that personal data will be treated in such a way as to guarantee confidentiality and integrity In order to guarantee the confidentiality of the study data, only the main researcher and her team of collaborators will have access to it, the CEI and the pertinent health authorities. FINANCING The financing is assumed by the Gema León Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinic. There is no direct economic consideration for this, although there is a dedication of time and work by the team of physiotherapists (social security, payroll, personal income tax, etc.) that is not economically remunerated and is assumed or absorbed this way. In addition, the RF technology (equipment and accessories) will be provided by the company INDIBA S.A., through a temporary assignment without any financial compensation either from the Gema León Physiotherapy Clinic, or from any patient. The treatment of these is completely free for them. The patient must travel to the clinic facilities and it is the researcher who will be responsible for the treatment in it. No difficulties are foreseen in its performance since it will be carried out using a schedule adapted to the patient that allows the study to be monitored. It is intended to carry out a longitudinal study with the participation of 99 patients with elbow musculoskeletal pathology, who confirmed a positive test for COVID-19. The sample size for our study is large enough to detect a clinically important difference in the primary outcome (s). For this, the investigators reviewed references at the bibliographic level, in which paired studies obtained a statistically significant value, being able to support our study. If the sample size was insufficient but statistically significant, the investigators would resort to expanding the sample. The division of the sample is carried out at random within the established groups. The patients will be divided into three groups: Group A or Placebo Group, which received the treatment with the machine turned off. Radiofrequency 448 Hz was administered to the affected area in two phases, depending on the electrode applied: 10 minutes of capacitive electrode and 35 minutes of resistive electrode, both with the machine turned off. Group B or Mixed Group, treatment with manual therapy and radiofrequency. Radiofrequency 448 Hz was administered to the affected area in two phases, depending on the electrode applied: 5 minutes of capacitive electrode and 25 minutes of resistive electrode. In addition, a specific joint physical therapy manual therapy treatment was also performed, in which pumping techniques were performed after the radiofrequency treatment.Group C or Manual Group, to which conventional manual therapy was applied for each case. Articulatory pumping techniques were applied towards the painful position with the aim of reducing it. Thus we compare the therapies of groups A, B and C, of Musculoskeletal Pathologies. All groups will be evaluated at the beginning, a second evaluation after 3 weeks and a third final control after 12 sessions. A fourth evaluation will be carried out after the last and final evaluation, 6 weeks after finishing the treatment. Each of the participants will be informed of the study, the objective, its possible benefits and the side effects that could arise. A) Therefore, each patient must give their free and confirmed consent through signature. Among the items in the methodology, the following stand out: Primary data parameters: A series of questions will be asked to each of the patients about the conditions diagnosed during the disease and those suffered after the infection that are directly related to abnormalities to be assessed. Secondary Data Parameters: The therapeutic protocol will be executed in the facilities of the Gema León Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinic (Cordoba, Spain). Such RF therapeutic protocol will be implemented by application with an INDIBA® Activ device, whose function is to reduce inflammation, stimulate immunity and promote tissue regeneration. This will consist of a 30-minute treatment, composed by 5 minutes of treatment with the capacitive electrode and 25 minutes of the resistive electrode. A total of 12 sessions will be scheduled (two per week), and all processes will be documented from the beginning of therapy (the resources used will be provided by INDIBA and the Gema León Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinic, whose supervision will be carried out by the direction of both). Dependent Variables: variables of nominal type such as sex, age, vaccination, number of days with symptoms, type of symptom will be created. The patients will be grouped into 3 groups of 33 participants each (99 in total): Group A or Placebo Group, which received the treatment with the machine turned off. Radiofrequency 448 Hz was administered to the affected area in two phases, depending on the electrode applied: 10 minutes of capacitive electrode and 35 minutes of resistive electrode, both with the machine turned off. Group B or Mixed Group, treatment with manual therapy and radiofrequency. Radiofrequency 448 Hz was administered to the affected area in two phases, depending on the electrode applied: 5 minutes of capacitive electrode and 25 minutes of resistive electrode. In addition, a specific joint physical therapy manual therapy treatment was also performed, in which pumping techniques were performed after the radiofrequency treatment. Group C or Manual Group, to which conventional manual therapy was applied for each case. Articulatory pumping techniques were applied towards the painful position with the aim of reducing it. Independent Variables: In order to compare the variables between groups, different methods of pain threshold and function of the mentioned systems will be used, such as: Global Functionality Scale (GAF), Katz Index for Independence, Lawton and Brody Scale of Basic Activities, Barthel index for disability, European Quality of Life 5-D Questionnaire (EURO- QoL 5-D) for quality of life, Tinetti test for gait and balance, joint amplitude scale measured with the goniometer (goniometry), strength muscle dynamometer (Dynamometry), pain index (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), reflectivity measurement with the Wartenberg Scale for bone tendon reflexes (ROTs), examination of sensitivity from evaluation of dermatomes. The statistical analysis is based on variables of nominal type mostly, which are suitable for the Chi square test with a significance value of 95% for the results (p \<0.05). However, if there are numerical data that must be compared between groups, the analysis will be used for ANOVA test with the same significance value for the comparison between results.

The main question it aims to answer: How much pain did you (patient) experience during SVP-implantation Several other questions will be answered regarding: patient´s perception of the procedure, complication rate, procedure data.

The study contains two groups which will be compared. Control group: will do SVP implantation under local anaesthesia Study group: will do SVP implantation under local anaesthesia and patient-controlled sedation.

The patients are asked to complete a questionnaire postoperatively which contains questions on pain perception and satisfaction.","The study is an open multicentre randomized controlled trial with a study and a control arm in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be randomized to either a control arm of LA for SVP-implantation or a study arm of PCS with propofol and alfentanil as adjunct to LA for SVP-implantation. The aim is to randomize 340 patients with an estimated patient recruitment over 18 months with a following 6 months of data cleaning and analysis. The trial will be performed at two centres; County Hospital Ryhov, Jönköping, Sweden and University Hospital Linköping, Sweden. SVP implantation procedure and perioperative time period is estimated to 2-4 hours. The primary endpoint is assessment of patients´ self-reported pain perception. Secondary outcomes include patient satisfaction, implantation conditions, sedation level, sedative and analgesic medication consumption, procedural time consumption as well as safety aspects, adverse events and estimation of perioperative experience. Participation in the trial ends after telephone inquiry one day postoperatively.

Control arm:

SVP-implantation in LA:

Subcutanous venous ports were introduced in 1981. A SVP is a small device around 3cm in diameter with an injectable membrane buried just under the skin. It is connected to a thin tube with its tip in a large bore vein. Access to the SVP is achieved by puncturing the skin with a needle.

Local anaesthetic causes the absence of pain sensation in the location where applied by decreasing the rate of depolarization and repolarization of excitable membranes such as nociceptors and nerves. The most commonly used solutions are from the amide group differing in pharmacokinetics. In order to reduce a burning sensation on infiltration substances can be combined with sodium bicarbonate. There will be no restrictions in the choice of LA-solution being left up to local practice at participating sites. With the beginning of the procedure LA is subcutaneously applied to patients in both groups. LA used at participating centres are Mepivacaine 10mg/ml, 20-40ml subcutaneously or Lidnocaine 10mg/ml, 20-40 ml subcutaneously.

Study arm:

SVP-implantation in LA and PCS:

In addition to LA, patients in the study group are able to self-administer a combination of propofol and alfentanil using a patient-controlled sedation pump. The pump enables the patient via a hand-held button to trigger the release of a single bolus of 0.5ml containing 4.5mg propofol and 25µg alfentanil under an 10 second period. This results in a maximal possible amount of 6 bolus doses per minute.

Propofol is a short-acting anaesthetic agent commonly used for general anaesthesia and procedural sedation. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed both through potentiation of GABAA receptor activity and in higher doses behaving as GABAA receptor agonist. When used for intravenous sedation a single dose wears off within minutes demanding for continuous or intermittent application.

Alfentanil is a short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic agent with rapid onset of effects at µ-opioid receptors. These properties make it suitable to provide analgesia for brief procedures and to infuse for longer procedures and yet provide relatively rapid recovery.

Rescue sedation will be available to patients in both groups on the patient´s or operator´s demand. Rescue sedation consists of propofol and alfentanil administered by the clinician and is documented in the e-CRF.

Setting:

This trial will be carried out in the following anaesthesia departments:

OP/IVA clinic, County Hospital Ryhov, Sweden AnOpIVA clinic, University Hospital Linköping, Sweden

Participants will be instructed on use of the PCS pump (Syramed µSP6000, Arcomed AG, Switzerland) by a nurse anesthetist. The syringe is loaded with 36 ml propofol (10 mg/ml) and 4 ml alfentanil (0.5 mg/ml). Each time the patient presses the handheld button, an aliquot of 0.5 ml is injected (4.5 mg propofol/0.025 mg alfentanil). The injection time is set to 10 s, restricting self-administration to a maximum of 6 bolus doses per minute corresponding to 27 mg propofol and 0.15 mg alfentanil per minute. No lockout period is applied. Local anaesthesia is injected in the operating site. Vital parameters prior to the procedure are recorded. Patients are monitored using electrocardiography for heartrate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiratory rate (RR) at 5-min intervals during the procedure.

The main question it aims to answer: How much pain did you (patient) experience during SVP-implantation Several other questions will be answered regarding: patient´s perception of the procedure, complication rate, procedure data. The study contains two groups which will be compared. Control group: will do SVP implantation under local anaesthesia Study group: will do SVP implantation under local anaesthesia and patient-controlled sedation. The patients are asked to complete a questionnaire postoperatively which contains questions on pain perception and satisfaction. The study is an open multicentre randomized controlled trial with a study and a control arm in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be randomized to either a control arm of LA for SVP-implantation or a study arm of PCS with propofol and alfentanil as adjunct to LA for SVP-implantation. The aim is to randomize 340 patients with an estimated patient recruitment over 18 months with a following 6 months of data cleaning and analysis. The trial will be performed at two centres; County Hospital Ryhov, Jönköping, Sweden and University Hospital Linköping, Sweden. SVP implantation procedure and perioperative time period is estimated to 2-4 hours. The primary endpoint is assessment of patients´ self-reported pain perception. Secondary outcomes include patient satisfaction, implantation conditions, sedation level, sedative and analgesic medication consumption, procedural time consumption as well as safety aspects, adverse events and estimation of perioperative experience. Participation in the trial ends after telephone inquiry one day postoperatively. Control arm: SVP-implantation in LA: Subcutanous venous ports were introduced in 1981. A SVP is a small device around 3cm in diameter with an injectable membrane buried just under the skin. It is connected to a thin tube with its tip in a large bore vein. Access to the SVP is achieved by puncturing the skin with a needle. Local anaesthetic causes the absence of pain sensation in the location where applied by decreasing the rate of depolarization and repolarization of excitable membranes such as nociceptors and nerves. The most commonly used solutions are from the amide group differing in pharmacokinetics. In order to reduce a burning sensation on infiltration substances can be combined with sodium bicarbonate. There will be no restrictions in the choice of LA-solution being left up to local practice at participating sites. With the beginning of the procedure LA is subcutaneously applied to patients in both groups. LA used at participating centres are Mepivacaine 10mg/ml, 20-40ml subcutaneously or Lidnocaine 10mg/ml, 20-40 ml subcutaneously. Study arm: SVP-implantation in LA and PCS: In addition to LA, patients in the study group are able to self-administer a combination of propofol and alfentanil using a patient-controlled sedation pump. The pump enables the patient via a hand-held button to trigger the release of a single bolus of 0.5ml containing 4.5mg propofol and 25µg alfentanil under an 10 second period. This results in a maximal possible amount of 6 bolus doses per minute. Propofol is a short-acting anaesthetic agent commonly used for general anaesthesia and procedural sedation. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed both through potentiation of GABAA receptor activity and in higher doses behaving as GABAA receptor agonist. When used for intravenous sedation a single dose wears off within minutes demanding for continuous or intermittent application. Alfentanil is a short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic agent with rapid onset of effects at µ-opioid receptors. These properties make it suitable to provide analgesia for brief procedures and to infuse for longer procedures and yet provide relatively rapid recovery. Rescue sedation will be available to patients in both groups on the patient´s or operator´s demand. Rescue sedation consists of propofol and alfentanil administered by the clinician and is documented in the e-CRF. Setting: This trial will be carried out in the following anaesthesia departments: OP/IVA clinic, County Hospital Ryhov, Sweden AnOpIVA clinic, University Hospital Linköping, Sweden Participants will be instructed on use of the PCS pump (Syramed µSP6000, Arcomed AG, Switzerland) by a nurse anesthetist. The syringe is loaded with 36 ml propofol (10 mg/ml) and 4 ml alfentanil (0.5 mg/ml). Each time the patient presses the handheld button, an aliquot of 0.5 ml is injected (4.5 mg propofol/0.025 mg alfentanil). The injection time is set to 10 s, restricting self-administration to a maximum of 6 bolus doses per minute corresponding to 27 mg propofol and 0.15 mg alfentanil per minute. No lockout period is applied. Local anaesthesia is injected in the operating site. Vital parameters prior to the procedure are recorded. Patients are monitored using electrocardiography for heartrate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (BP), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and respiratory rate (RR) at 5-min intervals during the procedure. Bradycardia is defined as HR \<40 beats/min, tachycardia as HR \>100 beats/min, hypotension as systolic BP \< 90 mmHg or a decrease of \>30% from baseline, hypoxia as SpO2 \<90% or a decrease of \>5% from baseline, and bradypnea as RR of \<8 breaths per minute.

Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint Etienne,OTHER,NCT02091479,Early Versus Late Resumption of Anticoagulation in Patients With Both High Thrombosis Risk and Major HEmoRrhage,"Randomized Assay Evaluating the Risk/Benefit of Early Versus Late Resumption of Anticoagulation in Patients With Major, Non-trauma Related Hemorrhage Occurring While on Anticoagulant Treatment for a High Risk of Thrombosis.","In patients with a high thromboembolic risk, withdrawing anticoagulant treatment is recommended in some situations, including when major hæmorrhage occurs. But withdrawing treatment can be risky. In patients on a curative dose of anticoagulant medicine, treatment withdrawal heightens the risk of thromboembolic events occurring, with potentially major consequences. For instance, mechanical valve thrombosis is fatal in 15% of patients. Resumption of anticoagulation is therefore critical in patients at high risk for thromboembolic events.

However, in these patients having presented major hæmorrhage, resumption of anticoagulation heightens the risk of hæmorrhage recurrence. This risk is even higher when the original hæmorrhage was not accessible via surgical, endoscopic or endoluminal hemostasis.

As far as investigators know, there is no data in the literature to rely on when the major hæmorrhage is not accessible via hemostatic intervention and the risk of thrombosis is high. When confronted with patients who need anticoagulation but have a high risk of hæmorrhage recurrence, the question of when treatment should be resumed has not been resolved. This is why investigators propose to conduct a randomised comparative study to evaluate two treatment strategies - early resumption (H48 to H72) versus late resumption (H120 to H144) of anticoagulation.

MAIN OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the present study is to evaluate in terms of bleeding risk, thrombosis risk and mortality at one month, the effect of early vs. late resumption of anticoagulation in patients having presented with serious hæmorrhage while on curative-dose anticoagulants and facing a high thromboembolic risk.","STUDY DESIGN: This is a comparative, randomised, open study assessing after 1 month and 3 months the effect of early (H48 to 72) versus late (H120 to 144) resumption of anticoagulation in patients presenting with serious bleeding while on anticoagulants (excluding intracerebral bleeding) and with a thromboembolic risk evaluated as high (except mitral prostheses). The accumulated frequency of major hæmorrhage, thromboembolic events and deaths should be 26% in case of early resumption and 15% in case of late resumption, i.e. a relative risk reduction of 43%. Based on this hypothesis, to obtain 80% power with two-sided α being 5%, each group should include 208 patients, for a total of 416 patients.

EVALUATION CRITERIA: The main criteria in this study will be the accumulated one-month incidence of hæmorrhage recurrence, thromboembolic complications and deaths. It is a combined criterion associating:

* Fatal hæmorrhage proven by autopsy or sudden deaths in a clinical context strongly suggestive of hæmorrhage
* Fatal thromboembolic events proven by autopsy or imagery or sudden deaths in a clinical context strongly suggestive of thrombosis
* Any clinically significant hæmorrhage leading to temporary (\> 24 hours) or permanent withdrawal of anticoagulant treatment
* Any symptomatic thromboembolic event in any territory, proven by imagery or surgery

These events will be validated by a committee for the validation of critical events blind to the date of anticoagulant treatment resumption. The secondary evaluation criteria will be symptomatic hæmorrhages, fatal or not, symptomatic thromboembolic incidents, fatal or not, and mortality at 1 month and 3 mont","Inclusion Criteria:affiliated with or a beneficiary of a social security category

Randomized controlled trials done at International Islamic University. The sample size was 32. The subjects were divided in two groups, 16 subjects in modified cross body stretch group and 16 in modified sleeper stretch group. Study duration was of 6 months. Sampling technique applied was non probability connivance sampling technique. Tools used in the study are PENN shoulder score, gonoiometer, thumb up back(TUB) and seated basketball throw test(SBBT). Data was be analyzed through SPSS 21.","Basketball is considered as the highly demanding sports due to high demand and complexity of the game. The overhead throwing activities makes it more vulnerable to the injuries. In repetitive throwing there are different type of violet forces placed on shoulder joint It causes adaptation in soft tissue anatomically which in turn limits ROM of shoulder joint and Posterior shoulder tightness.

Posterior capsule tightness can result due to abnormal humeral head motion which decreases subacromial space during overhead activities leading to compression of tissues causing limited shoulder flexion, internal rotation and horizontal adduction. Posterior capsule tightening occurs when the capsular tissue and musculature of the shoulder tighten, usually due to ""repeated overload in the eccentric portion of arm deceleration. This loss of internal rotation results from contracture and tightening of the posterior inferior portion of the glenohumeral joint capsule, which occurs from the repetitive microtrauma imparted during the deceleration phase of the throwing motion. Repetitive throwing motion creates adaptive increased external rotation and decreased internal rotation in the dominant shoulder joint which is termed as GIRD (Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit).Posterior capsule tightness is often treated without surgery. It can be treated by strengthening, stretching, neuromuscular control exercises. Strengthening protocol can perform specifically on Weak muscles by using resistance and weight. The neuromuscular training helps the body to act and react on different pattern of stress demand on it through neural pathways. The mainstay of the posterior capsule tightness treatment for athlete is the stretching of the posterior capsule. One author proposed the modified forms, the modified sleeper stretch and the modified cross body stretch.

Naestved Hospital,OTHER,NCT01335802,Relation Between Subclinical Hypothyroidism and Outcome of Pregnancy,Relation Between Thyroid Hormone Stimulated Mitochondrial Function and Spontaneous Abortion and Complications of Pregnancy in Subclinical Hypothyroidism,"Studies have demonstrated a relationship between subclinical hypothyroidism and obstetrics complications like preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia, placental abruption and stillbirth. Subclinical hypothyroidism and positive thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOab) may increase the risk of early spontaneous abortion before 12 weeks of gestation. But there is not a consensus if the prevalence of TPOab should be treated before and during pregnancy when the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal.

Thyroid hormones are regulators of the mitochondrial activity and our research group has previously shown that subclinical hypothyroidism affects mitochondrial activity.

The hypothesis:

Subclinical hypothyroidism causes early spontaneous abortion and or complications in pregnancy like pre-eclampsia because of mitochondrial dysfunction","The aim is to estimate the relationship between SH and spontaneous abortion and/or obstetric complications because of mitochondrial dysfunction.

1. A prospective study where data from the General Suburban Population Study in Naestved will be analyzed to measure the frequency of subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and TPOab. SH is defined as raised serum concentrations of TSH \> 3,4 mU/l and normal levels of free T4 and T3. A cut-off of 60 mU/l is used for TPOab.
2. To estimate the relationship between SH or TPOab and early spontaneous abortion and pregnancy outcome. Inclusion of women who have experienced a minimum of one early spontaneous abortion and between 20 and 50 years old: 50 women who have SU and/or TPOab-positive and 50 women who have normal levels of TSH and TPOab-negative. The basal oxygen consumption will be measured and mitochondrial functions will be determined by flow cytometry.
3. To estimate the prevalence of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia among pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism and estimate the mitochondrial function. A minimum of 100 pregnant women without any thyroid disease or diabetes will be included.

Early spontaneous abortion is defined as abortion before 12 weeks of gestation. Obstetrics complications are defined as pre-eclampsia (proteinuria, oedema, hypertension), pregnancy-induced hypertension, placental insufficience (IUGR) and abruption, preterm delivery and stillbirth. Those complications will be analyzed from the data of the obstetric journals.

Measurement of oxygen consumption:

Respiratory gas analysis and volume measurements were performed with a canopy connected by a triple V (flow⁄gas sensor) to an Oxycon apparatus (Jaeger Oxycon Champion, Breda, the Netherlands). The equipment was calibrated before each test to compensate for ambient conditions such as air pressure, temperature and humidity. Basal VO2 was measured after at least 6 hours fasting. Before the test the individual resting pulse was established and the participants rested for about 30 min in a chair. The test room was quiet and the lighting was subdued. The subjects were given sufficient time to become familiarized with the equipment and the procedures and the test was initiated when the resting pulse was achieved. Oxygen consumption was measured when the uptake per minute remained constant. Measurements were performed for repeated periods of 30 seconds for 20 minutes. The method for recording oxygen uptake had a within-day variation of 0.8 % and a day-to-day variation of 5.8 %.

Measurement of mitochondrial mass (MM) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by flow cytometry:

Venous blood was drawn from the patient in EDTA Vacutainer tubes. From each patient 2 samples of 100 µl of blood were processed. One unstained control tube and one stained were analyzed.

The samples to be stained were added 1 µl Pacific Blue Mouse Anti-Human anti-CD14 (BD Biosciences, Denmark) and mixed. The tubes were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature protected from direct light and subsequently washed.

The stained cells were resuspended in 890 µl PBS and added 10 µl 1 µM MTG (MitoTracker Green FM, Invitrogen A/S, Denmark) and 100 µl 1 µM TMRM (Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester, Invitrogen A/S, Denmark). All stock solutions were dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and working solutions were diluted in PBS. After mixing samples were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark.","Part 2:

University of British Columbia,OTHER,NCT01280084,Labour Analgesia and Movement in Babies,The Effect of Labour Analgesia on Babies' Movements After Birth: An Actigraphic Study,"This study aims to measure movements in babies after they are born using an actigraph, a wristwatch-sized device worn on the ankle, which works similarly to the device used by runners to count the number of steps they have taken. We aim to compare the movements of babies whose mothers have received different types of pain relief in labour.","The purpose of the study is to investigate the potential utility of actigraphy, a non-invasive means of measuring an individual's movements, in distinguishing the effects of different types of maternal labour analgesia on babies after birth.

The study hypothesizes that actigraphic data can be used to differentiate the effects on neonates of different forms of maternal intrapartum analgesia. In particular, we hypothesize that infants of mothers who receive intrapartum opioid analgesia will demonstrate fewer movements than infants of mothers who receive epidural analgesia or those who receive nothing.

Whilst it is well known that drugs administered to mothers during labour can affect their babies, means of assessing this effect are complex and unreliable. A more objective means of assessing babies after birth is required, and actigraphy may represent a useful technique. Actigraphy has been used on babies in other studies in a variety of settings, including comparing babies born by different delivery modes (i.e. vaginal versus cesarean delivery) and at different gestations (i.e. term versus preterm), although none of these studies have considered maternal analgesia received prior to delivery as a possible influence on babies' movements after birth. Other studies that have looked at sleep parameters in babies, particularly measures of activity, have shown association with later indices of psychomotor development.

The objective of the study is to compare actigraph-derived movement data from babies whose mothers have received any of the commonly used analgesic techniques for labour at BC Women's Hospital.

This is a prospective observational study. Women will be assessed for eligibility for the study on admission to the labour ward. As one of the inclusion criteria is vaginal birth, women considered eligible on admission may become ineligible depending on their mode fo delivery. Information will be available to all women in the assessment rooms and consent will be specifically sought after they deliver and are deemed eligible. We plan to recruit the babies of mothers who receive analgesia in one of four categories: no analgesia or nitrous oxide only; systemically administered opioid analgesia only; epidural analgesia with an intermediate total dose of fentanyl (\<150mcg); epidural analgesia with a high total dose of fentanyl (\>150mcg). We recognize that women may receive several or even all of the different modalities of labour analgesia in the course of their delivery. In this situation, we will calculate the total dose fo opioid received by all routes and convert this to fentanyl equivalents for the purposes of analysis. Neonates of women who agree to participate will be fitted with an actigraph that will remain in place (except for removal for bathing) for 24 hours, or until discharge from hospital. Actigraphs are small, light-weight, wrist-watch-sized monitors that weight 16 grams. The actigraphs will be placed on the neonates' ankle, as this position has been reported to cause less disturbance to them. Parents of participating neonates will also be instructed in the use fo a daily dairy that will allow correlation of actigraphic movement data with events such as bathing (when the actigraph will necessarily be removed) and other external sources of movements (e.g. being rocked, breastfeeding).","Inclusion Criteria:

* Neonates born to healthy women with singleton pregnancies who deliver vaginally at term gestation (\> 37 weeks)

We aim to compare the movements of babies whose mothers have received different types of pain relief in labour. The purpose of the study is to investigate the potential utility of actigraphy, a non-invasive means of measuring an individual's movements, in distinguishing the effects of different types of maternal labour analgesia on babies after birth. The study hypothesizes that actigraphic data can be used to differentiate the effects on neonates of different forms of maternal intrapartum analgesia. In particular, we hypothesize that infants of mothers who receive intrapartum opioid analgesia will demonstrate fewer movements than infants of mothers who receive epidural analgesia or those who receive nothing. Whilst it is well known that drugs administered to mothers during labour can affect their babies, means of assessing this effect are complex and unreliable. A more objective means of assessing babies after birth is required, and actigraphy may represent a useful technique. Actigraphy has been used on babies in other studies in a variety of settings, including comparing babies born by different delivery modes (i.e. vaginal versus cesarean delivery) and at different gestations (i.e. term versus preterm), although none of these studies have considered maternal analgesia received prior to delivery as a possible influence on babies' movements after birth. Other studies that have looked at sleep parameters in babies, particularly measures of activity, have shown association with later indices of psychomotor development. The objective of the study is to compare actigraph-derived movement data from babies whose mothers have received any of the commonly used analgesic techniques for labour at BC Women's Hospital. This is a prospective observational study. Women will be assessed for eligibility for the study on admission to the labour ward. As one of the inclusion criteria is vaginal birth, women considered eligible on admission may become ineligible depending on their mode fo delivery. Information will be available to all women in the assessment rooms and consent will be specifically sought after they deliver and are deemed eligible. We plan to recruit the babies of mothers who receive analgesia in one of four categories: no analgesia or nitrous oxide only; systemically administered opioid analgesia only; epidural analgesia with an intermediate total dose of fentanyl (\<150mcg); epidural analgesia with a high total dose of fentanyl (\>150mcg). We recognize that women may receive several or even all of the different modalities of labour analgesia in the course of their delivery. In this situation, we will calculate the total dose fo opioid received by all routes and convert this to fentanyl equivalents for the purposes of analysis. Neonates of women who agree to participate will be fitted with an actigraph that will remain in place (except for removal for bathing) for 24 hours, or until discharge from hospital. Actigraphs are small, light-weight, wrist-watch-sized monitors that weight 16 grams. The actigraphs will be placed on the neonates' ankle, as this position has been reported to cause less disturbance to them. Parents of participating neonates will also be instructed in the use fo a daily dairy that will allow correlation of actigraphic movement data with events such as bathing (when the actigraph will necessarily be removed) and other external sources of movements (e.g. being rocked, breastfeeding). Inclusion Criteria: * Neonates born to healthy women with singleton pregnancies who deliver vaginally at term gestation (\> 37 weeks) * Mothers aged 19 years or older and understand written and oral English * Neonates who are neurologically healthy Exclusion Criteria: * Cesarean delivery; patients booked for cesarean delivery presenting in labour * Maternal opioid dependence * Maternal sedative or psychotropic medications * Maternal combined spinal epidural (CSE) analgesia in labour * Forceps delivery; 4th degree perineal tears * Birth weight greater than 4.5 kg * Intrapartum fetal heart rate abnormalities requiring immediate delivery * Neonates of mothers who receive epidural morphine for post-delivery analgesia * Neonates requiring admission to NICU * Neonates with obvious congenital anomalies",OTHER

Objectives: 1) to conduct a pilot cross-over randomized intervention study testing the hypothesis that the health benefits of two different high nitrate vegetable juices products will be similar; 2) to measure the volunteers' BP as the primary outcome; and 3) to collect biological samples over the course of this study for the measurement of proposed biomarkers of nutritional status, including plasma nitrate.","In this study, it is hypothesized that oral supplementation with different vegetable juices (beetroot and green leafy vegetable) juice, with similar nitrate content, over a one week period, will decrease BP in healthy volunteers to a similar extent.

Plan of Investigation: This study will be a randomised, controlled, crossover (2 groups) trial of beetroot juice and green leafy vegetable juice.

Participants A total of 16 healthy volunteers will be recruited (male and female), according to the stated inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Recruitment Subjects will be screened and recruited from the general population through advertisement, through local community groups and staff intranet postings (university setting). The investigators have established mechanisms for recruiting from these populations that have proven to be effective in previous studies.

Study design Following screening, eligible participants will give informed written consent. Participants will be randomized, using computer-generated random numbers, to two groups.

Before starting the intervention (one week before), participants will be asked to complete a four day food diary.

Participants will consume one of the stated interventions daily (in the evening) for one week. Then, the participant will follow their normal diet and will not consume nitrate-rich juices for two weeks (washout period). In the fourth week, participants will consume the alternative intervention to that already consumed - beetroot juice or green leafy vegetables juice for a further one week.

Intervention products The beetroot juice will be Organic beetroot and apple juice (James White Drinks Ltd, UK), while the leafy green vegetable juice will be Leanandgreen (Cold Pressed Juice) composed of 30% celery, 30% cucumber, 15% romaine, 15% spinach, 5% kale, 2.5% ginger and 2.5% lemon (B. Fresh, UK). Both juices are available at Sainsbury's supermarket.

Both juices contain 5.5 mmol nitrate with different amount of the other nutrients. 250 ml of green leafy vegetable juice and 115 ml of beetroot juice will provide 5.5 mmol of nitrate daily to the participants.

Juices will provided to the volunteers by the researcher before the intervention week and both juices will have expiry dates that are beyond the intervention duration.

Other lifestyle practices Participants will be asked to not change any other part of their diet and to keep physical activity, alcohol, and caffeine and water source normal. Participants will be asked to avoid using mouthwash during the intervention weeks, as this can interfere with nitrate metabolism.

Justification for one-week intervention period. Inorganic nitrate and BP will respond quickly to the intervention, so a one week intervention period will be sufficiently long to ensure that participants will reach a steady state with regard to nitrate status.

Study assessments (for participant characterisation, in addition to primary and secondary outcome data collection as described) During each intervention week participants will be asked to complete a further four day food diary. Participants will also attend the Centre for Public Health (CPH) to give a blood sample and have BP measured at the start and end of each intervention period. Anthropometric data (weight and height) will also be obtained by standard procedures and BMI will be calculated as weight in kg divided by the squared height in metres.

Blood samples (20 ml) will be drawn from the antecubital vein and immediately separated and stored for the proposed assays detailed below. All blood samples will be stored at -70°C until analysis.

Power As this is a pilot study, power calculations have not been conducted.

Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be carried out using SPSS for Windows, version 17. A medical statistician within CPH will give statistical advice where required. Analysis of this two-period crossover study will be carried out according to the Hills \& Armitage method. If there are no significant period or carry-over effects, which will be tested for, paired samples t-tests will be used to compare the intervention group.

Uses of pulse oximetry include detection of hypoxia, avoidance of hyperoxia, titration of fractional inspired oxygen, and enabling weaning from mechanical ventilation. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, such as by the use of CO-oximeter, provides a direct measurement of SaO2. However, ABG analysis requires time, expense, and arterial access. Therefore, this study aims to validate the SpO2 accuracy of pulse oximetry sensors (manufactured by Nellcor and Masimo, and reprocessed by Medline Industries, LP) in neonates as compared to ABG measurements as part of their clinical standard of care (SOC), as assessed by CO-oximetry.","Inclusion Criteria:

Pulse oximetry helps in measuring peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) continuously and non-invasively, and provides an indirect measurement of arterial oxygenation (SaO2) based on the red and infrared light-absorption characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Uses of pulse oximetry include detection of hypoxia, avoidance of hyperoxia, titration of fractional inspired oxygen, and enabling weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The University of Hong Kong,OTHER,NCT01887184,Sedation Using Intranasal Dexmedetomidine in Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,A Study to Assess Sedation Using Intranasal Dexmedetomidine in Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,"Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, like many other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, may be associated with discomfort. Although upper endoscopy is usually of shorter duration and better tolerated by patients, most trials investigating the influence of analgesia and sedation have been performed on patients undergoing this procedure. Some patients may tolerate colonoscopy without sedation, but various techniques are used to limit discomfort and pain. Selection and dosing of sedatives depends on the patient's emotional state, the intensity of pain during examination, foreseeable technical difficulties, the endoscopist's experience, the presence or absence of anesthesia personnel, and hospital-specific procedures.

Conscious sedation is a popular technique for colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The combination of an opioid and a benzodiazepine is known to provide good analgesic and sedative conditions during endoscopy. This combination of opioid and benzodiazepine, however, also increases the risk of respiratory depression. Therefore, pharmacologic agents which may provide adequate sedation without respiratory depression are of great interest to clinicians.

Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative and analgesic effects. Compared with clonidine, it is more selective for the α 2 adrenoceptor and acts as a full agonist in most pharmacologic test models. Potentially desirable properties include decreased requirements for other anesthetics and analgesics, a diminished sympathetic response to stress and the potential for cardioprotective effects against myocardial ischemia. When compared with conventional sedatives such as opioids or benzodiazepines, its lack of respiration depression is a distinct advantage. Previous studies using dexmedetomidine for sedation has been promising with maintenance of respiratory function. Patients are readily arousable. With intravenous slow bolus administration, there is a minimal increase in blood pressure initially, followed by a slight decrease in blood pressure. Lower dose ranges, avoidance of rapid bolus injection, and a slow rate of administration tend to decrease these circulatory side effects. Many clinical studies have shown that it can be well and safely used intravenously, intramuscularly and transdermally. Although not an officially technique, there are also reports of intranasal administration resulting in fairly predictable onset in both adults and children.","Aims:

This study aims to evaluate sedative effects using intranasal dexmedetomidine in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy, side effects and acceptability of sedation using intranasal dexmedetomidine by patients and endoscopist for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Methods:

Double blind randomized prospective study.

Sample size:

We are planning to detect not less than 30% decrease of rescue propofol consumption when using intranasal dexmedetomidine. Assuming the average propofol consumption for the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to be 40mg with SD=15mg, the required sample size with 80% power of test is 25 per group at the 0.05 level of significance.

They will be randomly allocated to one of the following study groups:

Group D: Intranasal dexmedetomidine 1.5mcg/kg; Group P: Intranasal saline (placebo)

In addition, rescue sedation will be provided by a patient-controlled sedation using propofol/ alfentanil in both groups. Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) has been shown to provide safe and effective sedation for the individual patient by allowing the patient to decide whether he or she requires sedation and to determine the amount required. PCS has been used for various procedures performed under local and regional anesthesia. PCS with propofol and alfentanil has been used for sedation of patients during endoscopy.

Process Written consent will be signed. No sedative premedication will be prescribed. The patients will be fasted for 6 hours before the procedure. Then patients will be sent to the endoscopy room about 1 hour before the procedure. A nasal catheter is positioned to deliver oxygen if oxygen is needed. Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2 and respiratory rate will be recorded. After obtaining baseline hemodynamic data (NIBP, HR) and respiratory data (SpO2, RR), the patients will be asked to evaluate their baseline levels of anxiety using a numerical rating scale.

The intranasal study drugs will be administrated according to a code on a piece of folded paper drawn randomly from a box. The patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups and sedation will be performed 1 hour before the procedure as follows:

P) Placebo (0.015ml/kg); D) Intranasal dexmedetomidine 0.015ml/kg

Before study drug administration, patients gently blow their noses. After baseline testing, an investigator who is blind to the study medication will administers the study drug to each naris and the patient remains in a semi-recumbent position with the head of the bed elevated at a 20-40 angle.

After which, measurements including HR, NiBP, SpO2, RR will be recorded every 5 minutes while Numerical Rating Scale of anxiety every 15 minutes. Sedation is evaluated by investigator using Observer Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation (OAA/S\]) scale every 15 minutes. Both the investigators and the subjects are blinded to the study medications. The patient will be shown 2 cards of picture about 1 hour after the study drug administration.

An intravenous cannula will be inserted then. The degree of the cannulation pain will be assessed as using NRSpaincannulation. The intravenous cannula is connected to a 50 mL syringe patient-controlled analgesia pump containing 200 mg (20 mL) propofol and 0.5 mg (1 mL) alfentanil, which will be provided as the rescue sedative medications. The drugs are delivered in response to pressure on a hand-held button. Each bolus dose of 0.5 mL delivered contained 4.8 mg propofol and 12 μg alfentanil. No loading dose was used and the lock out time was set at zero. Despite the zero lock out time, a few seconds were required for the pump to deliver the preset bolus. The PCA pump was programmed to deliver a bolus dose of 0.5 ml at 200 ml/h on patient's demand and the pump took 9 s to deliver the bolus, during which time it would not respond to a further demand. Thus, the effective lockout time was 9s. Patients are instructed in the use of the hand-held button before upper endoscopy.

After the cannulation, local anesthetic spray will be administered to the oropharynx or rectum. 10 minutes after the local anesthesia, patient may start to push the button. When the first dose of propofol and alfentanil is infused, patient will be asked whether there is any pain of infusion, and the degree of the pain will be assessed as Numerical Rating Scale of pain due to infusion.

The procedure will be started once the patients feel that they are relaxed. Vital signs including NIBP, SpO2, HR, RR, and OAA/S will be monitored throughout the sedation and procedure process every 5 minutes. If the patient becomes totally unresponsive or any adverse event occurs, the procedure will be stopped. If the SpO2 falls to below 90% for more than 10 seconds, the endoscope will be removed and the patient's vital signs observed, and O2 administered as required by the attending anesthesiologist until the patient becomes responsive again. Once the patient starts responding to command, the procedure will continue. Duration of unresponsiveness would be recorded. The time of start of procedure and duration of procedure and the frequencies of interruption due to patient events will be noted. The PCS propofol and alfentanil will be terminated and disconnected from the patient when the endoscopist indicates that the operative procedure is completed, and the dose consumption recorded. The endoscopist will determine the operating conditions by evaluating the ease of insertion and the patient's lack of motion and ability to obey commands, using NRSsatisfactionendoscopist.

The patients will be transferred to the recovery room for monitoring for 30 minutes. The vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, RR and SpO2, and OAA/S) will be continued every 5 min. When the patients are fully recovered, they will be asked if there is any pain and discomfort and their severity will be assessed as NRSpain and NRSdiscomfort during the procedure. Discomfort is defined as 'a feeling of uneasiness that interfered with the patient's ability to relax'. They will also be asked if they remember any of the following events: the pictures shown to them, the insertion of the endoscope, the discomfort and pain during the examination.

Discharge criteria will be assessed as postanaesthesia discharge score hourly. When the patients are fully recovered, defined as an OAA/S score of 5 and the postanaesthesia score is more than 9, they are fit for discharge. Satisfaction evaluation of sedation will be graded by the patients on NRS in satisfaction patient. They will be questioned on whether they think that they have received an adequate amount of sedation, too little or too much, whether they are relaxed and whether they will undergo the same procedure again.

After which, measurements including HR, NiBP, SpO2, RR will be recorded every 5 minutes while Numerical Rating Scale of anxiety every 15 minutes. Sedation is evaluated by investigator using Observer Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation (OAA/S\]) scale every 15 minutes. Both the investigators and the subjects are blinded to the study medications. The patient will be shown 2 cards of picture about 1 hour after the study drug administration. An intravenous cannula will be inserted then. The degree of the cannulation pain will be assessed as using NRSpaincannulation. The intravenous cannula is connected to a 50 mL syringe patient-controlled analgesia pump containing 200 mg (20 mL) propofol and 0.5 mg (1 mL) alfentanil, which will be provided as the rescue sedative medications. The drugs are delivered in response to pressure on a hand-held button. Each bolus dose of 0.5 mL delivered contained 4.8 mg propofol and 12 μg alfentanil. No loading dose was used and the lock out time was set at zero. Despite the zero lock out time, a few seconds were required for the pump to deliver the preset bolus. The PCA pump was programmed to deliver a bolus dose of 0.5 ml at 200 ml/h on patient's demand and the pump took 9 s to deliver the bolus, during which time it would not respond to a further demand. Thus, the effective lockout time was 9s. Patients are instructed in the use of the hand-held button before upper endoscopy. After the cannulation, local anesthetic spray will be administered to the oropharynx or rectum. 10 minutes after the local anesthesia, patient may start to push the button. When the first dose of propofol and alfentanil is infused, patient will be asked whether there is any pain of infusion, and the degree of the pain will be assessed as Numerical Rating Scale of pain due to infusion. The procedure will be started once the patients feel that they are relaxed. Vital signs including NIBP, SpO2, HR, RR, and OAA/S will be monitored throughout the sedation and procedure process every 5 minutes. If the patient becomes totally unresponsive or any adverse event occurs, the procedure will be stopped. If the SpO2 falls to below 90% for more than 10 seconds, the endoscope will be removed and the patient's vital signs observed, and O2 administered as required by the attending anesthesiologist until the patient becomes responsive again. Once the patient starts responding to command, the procedure will continue. Duration of unresponsiveness would be recorded. The time of start of procedure and duration of procedure and the frequencies of interruption due to patient events will be noted. The PCS propofol and alfentanil will be terminated and disconnected from the patient when the endoscopist indicates that the operative procedure is completed, and the dose consumption recorded. The endoscopist will determine the operating conditions by evaluating the ease of insertion and the patient's lack of motion and ability to obey commands, using NRSsatisfactionendoscopist. The patients will be transferred to the recovery room for monitoring for 30 minutes. The vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, RR and SpO2, and OAA/S) will be continued every 5 min. When the patients are fully recovered, they will be asked if there is any pain and discomfort and their severity will be assessed as NRSpain and NRSdiscomfort during the procedure. Discomfort is defined as 'a feeling of uneasiness that interfered with the patient's ability to relax'. They will also be asked if they remember any of the following events: the pictures shown to them, the insertion of the endoscope, the discomfort and pain during the examination. Discharge criteria will be assessed as postanaesthesia discharge score hourly. When the patients are fully recovered, defined as an OAA/S score of 5 and the postanaesthesia score is more than 9, they are fit for discharge. Satisfaction evaluation of sedation will be graded by the patients on NRS in satisfaction patient. They will be questioned on whether they think that they have received an adequate amount of sedation, too little or too much, whether they are relaxed and whether they will undergo the same procedure again.

San Francisco Department of Public Health,OTHER_GOV,NCT04614584,Mirtazapine and Methamphetamine Drug-drug Interaction Study,Phase 1 Safety-interaction Study of Mirtazapine for the Treatment of Methamphetamine Use Disorder,"This is a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of mirtazapine for methamphetamine (MA) use disorder (MUD) to ensure the safety of this medication in the presence of a relevant dose of MA for people actively-using MA.

Aim 1: To determine if mirtazapine alters the cardiovascular response to IV MA.

Aim 2: To determine if the pharmacokinetics of IV MA are altered by mirtazapine administration.

Aim 3: To evaluate the above aims in the setting of concomitant administration of methadone.

This study involves two simultaneous within-subject drug-drug interaction studies, each comprised of 12 participants. A total of 24 subjects will be enrolled who have methamphetamine use disorder who will be classified into 2 groups: (Group 1: no opioids; Group 2: opioid use disorder on methadone maintenance). Subjects will be randomized to the order of mirtazapine and placebo (i.e. one-half will receive mirtazapine first, then placebo; one-half will receive placebo first, then mirtazapine).","This is a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of mirtazapine for methamphetamine (MA) use disorder (MUD) to ensure the safety of this medication in the presence of a relevant dose of MA for people actively-using MA. MA is a widely used psychostimulant associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. MA is more prevalent than many other drugs, including opioids, with 37 million users of MA and amphetamine worldwide and 1.4 million past-year users in the U.S. alone in 2016. The number of MA poisoning deaths has steadily risen in recent years, from \>3,700 in 2014 to 10,333 in 2017. Importantly, MA has been recognized as contributing substantially to the U.S. opioid crisis, with about half of MA poisoning deaths also caused by opioids. In the U.S., the annual economic cost of MA use is estimated to be $23.4 billion and use is strongly associated with HIV transmission.

There are no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for MUD, a major gap in addiction medicine, especially because behavioral interventions alone have limited efficacy and would likely benefit from adjunctive pharmacologic therapy. Investigators' prior clinical trials included a Phase IIa trial (N=60) and a replication Phase IIb trial (N=120) demonstrating that mirtazapine (an adrenergic, serotoninergic, and dopaminergic generic medication currently approved to treat depression) 30mg orally once daily reduced MA use among MA-dependent men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women. Investigators were directed to conduct a DDI study to ensure the safety of mirtazapine with MA. This research is particularly relevant given the overlap of MA use disorder and opioid use disorder (OUD), which could raise additional safety concerns.

The primary objectives of this study are as follows:

1. To determine if mirtazapine 30mg daily alters the cardiovascular response to IV MA. The interaction of active medication (compared with placebo) with relevant doses of MA (30 mg) on cardiovascular (heart rate, blood pressure, QTc interval) parameters and adverse events, including serotonergic signs, will be assessed to gather safety information in the Phase I human laboratory.
2. To determine if mirtazapine alters the pharmacokinetics of IV MA. Pharmacokinetic parameters for MA and its major metabolites will be assessed over 48 hours under steady state mirtazapine (30 mg) or placebo, and relevant IV MA challenge (30 mg).
3. To evaluate the above aims in the setting of concomitant steady-state administration of morphine or methadone.

Design This study involves two simultaneous within-subject drug-drug interaction studies, each comprised of 12 participants. A total of 24 subjects will be enrolled who have MA use disorder who will be classified into 2 groups: (Group 1: no opioids; Group 2: opioid use disorder on methadone maintenance). Subjects will be randomized to the order of mirtazapine and placebo (i.e. one-half will receive mirtazapine first, then placebo; one-half will receive placebo first, then mirtazapine).

Procedures Screening assessments will be completed across two-to-four visits over 2 weeks. All screening assessments should be completed within 14 days after labs are drawn.

All subjects will complete the following study visits: screening 1 and 2, enrollment/admission to inpatient stay, 14-day inpatient stay, 14-day post-discharge follow-up visit.

After consent is obtained, eligibility will be determined over the following screening visits, including medical history and physical examination (including weight and height), review of systems, vital signs, concomitant medications, EKG, breathalyzer, labwork, SCID. Additional assessments will include the CDS-12, PSQI, TLFB for substance use, delayed discounting, BIS-11, Stroop Test, CUDIT-r, COWS, ACSA, BDI-II.

On the day of enrollment, study staff will confirm eligibility and transport patient to hospital for admission. Participant will receive a test infusion of MA 30mg IV. If participant tolerates test infusion within defined parameters, participant will be formally enrolled and randomized. First dose of study drug will be administered the evening of admission. On the fifth hospital day, participant will undergo MA challenge (single-blind placebo and 30mg IV for subjective, cardiovascular, and PK assessments). PK draws will continue for 48 hours after infusion.

Participant will begin the opposite condition on day 8 and complete the MA infusion procedures on day 12. After completion of PK studies on day 14, participant will be discharged.

A post-discharge safety check will be completed 10 days after discharge (+/- 7 days).","Inclusion Criteria:

University of British Columbia,OTHER,NCT03651284,Investigating the Efficacy of a Mobile App Intervention to Change Youth and Their Families' Health Behaviours,Project LiGHT (Living Green and Healthy for Teens): A Novel Weight Management Program That Emphasizes the Benefits of a Healthy Lifestyle,"This study is the second of three sub-studies aimed at evaluating the outcomes of the Living Green and Healthy for Teens (LiGHT) program, delivered through the Aim2Be app (v2.2). Aim2Be is an app for 10 to 17 year olds and their families that is intended to help them shift from an healthy lifestyle toward better health habits in four areas: nutrition, physical activity, recreational screen time, and sleep. This second evaluation has the following aims to: 1) describe reach; 2) assess change in knowledge of Canadian health recommendations; and 3) assess change in lifestyle behaviours and weight outcomes and whether these changes are moderated by involvement in the app. This study uses a two-group parallel/crossover randomized controlled trial design following N=200 families for six months.","Living Green and Healthy for Teens (LiGHT v2) is an engaging online, individualized, gamified lifestyle management program for youth, delivered through the Aim2Be app. LiGHT v2 is focused on initiating long-term behaviour change in youth and their families in order to help them shift from an unhealthy lifestyle toward better health habits in four areas: nutrition, physical activity, recreational screen time, and sleep. The program aims to support healthy lifestyles of 10- to 17-year-old children and adolescents, as well as to mitigate increased risk for metabolic and non-metabolic complications associated with obesity in the short and long term.

The app includes content that involve the family, and focus on behavioural therapy as well as dietary and physical activity patterns. Aim2Be is intended to be engaging and fun, provide virtual and tangible rewards, interact with participants multiple times per day, and provide a mobile social support network.

Pre-teens (10-13) and teens (14-17) will each have their own unique versions of Aim2Be. Content will be tailored specifically to the developmental stage and needs of each age group. The content will be delivered in such a way that it facilitates education, peer-to-peer conversation, and self-regulation in an engaging platform.

Because parents have been shown to be of primary importance in supporting healthy lifestyles of children, LiGHT v2 will educated and engage parents as well as youth. Parents will receive separate, but complementary content, intended to guide them as they shop for and prepare food and make behavioural changes within their families. The content for parents will be delivered using the same social aspects of Aim2Be as the pre-teens and teens, but the channels will be gated, so teens and parents each have their own space. Aim2Be's social features will help parents strategize and empathize with other families who wish to adopt healthy lifestyles.

The program will be evaluated using three separate study groups. This protocol describes the second of the three.

Families (one parent and one child) will be recruited through advertising on social media and through active referral from six Canadian Pediatric Weight Management Registry (CANPWR) sites (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, SickKids, McMaster Children's Hospital, Stollery Children's Hospital, Alberta Children's Hospital, and British Columbia Children's Hospital). Approximately 350 families will be recruited and a total of 200 families will be enrolled into the study and randomized into two groups. This study uses a two-group parallel/crossover randomized controlled trial design. All families will be given access to Aim2Be v2.2 to use from their mobile device or home computer. Participants will be prospectively followed for six months.

Once participants are deemed eligible to participate in the study and complete their baseline assessments, they are allocated to one of two conditions: 1) Live Coach; or 3) waitlist control group given standard of care. Participants in the Live Coach group will be given access to Aim2Be for six months with a live coach who has expertise in supporting lifestyle modification and will help youth and parents set goals and achieve these goals using principles from motivational interviewing. Participants in the control group will be wait listed for enrollment in the app for three months and will be given access to the Virtual Coach version of the app after they complete the three month evaluation. The Virtual Coach group version provides automated guidance from a virtual coach instead of a live person, but that is programmed using the same motivational interviewing principles.

Evaluation at baseline, three months, and six months will be used to compare whether those assigned to the different coach conditions have better health outcomes than those assigned to the waitlist control group. Parents will complete questionnaires at baseline, three months, and six months, which assess sociodemographics, behaviours, and mediators of behaviour change. Youth will complete questionnaires at baseline, three months, and six months, which assess health behaviours, mediators of behaviour change, and knowledge of Canadian recommendations for healthy behaviours. Questionnaire data will be collected and managed using REDCap.

Families will be provided with a Fitbit, scale, and measuring tape when they enroll in the study. At each assessment point (baseline, three months, and six months), parents will provide youth's height and weight, and youth will complete three 24-hour dietary recalls and wear the Fitbit for the duration of the study.

Honoraria will be paid at each time point to compensate participation.

Participants will be randomly allocated to each of the two groups and have equal likelihood of assignment to each condition. Participants will not be blinded as the design of the intervention does not facilitate this. Participants will be informed of their allocation after completing all baseline measures. Evaluators and researchers will be blinded to allocation during data analysis.

The aims of this study are to: 1) determine reach/ who participates in this study (short term outcome); 2) determine whether participation in the program increases adolescents' knowledge of Canadian health recommendations related to dietary habits, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour (medium term outcome); and 3) assess the impact of Aim2Be on changes in dietary habits, physical activity, and sedentary behaviours as well as Body Mass Index (BMI) and whether the impact is moderated by involvement in the app (long term outcome).","Inclusion Criteria:

The study tests the hypothesis that the intervention will improve the viral load status of patients and improve attendance for HIV primary care.","This study examines the effect of an HIV clinic-based multi-component intervention on HIV patients' subsequent viral load status and attendance for HIV primary care. The intervention has clinic-wide and targeted components. The clinic-wide components are given to all HIV patients when they attend clinic for primary care and include: (1) patient behavioral screening used by providers in the clinical care of patients and (2) dissemination of palm cards which contain messages about the importance of adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART), coming to clinic regularly, and safer sex. The targeted components focus on patients whose viral loads exceed 1000 copies/mL. Targeted components include: (1) an interactive computer-based intervention (CBI) completed twice (separated by 2-4 months) by patients at the clinic and (2) referral for one-on-one counseling from trained project Health Coaches if the patient's viral load does not show a 1-log reduction after the first CBI or remains above 200 copies/mL after two administrations of the CBI.

Patients are not individually randomly assigned to arms. The multi-component intervention is evaluated using a group-randomized design. Clinics were randomized to either Panel A or Panel B with the intent of equating the two panels on the percentage of patients with suppressed viral load prior to implementing the intervention. Three clinics (Panel A) begin intervention activities, and the other three clinics (Panel B) delay onset of all intervention activities for 16 months and thus serve as a concurrent control group during that 16-month period. This enables between-panel comparisons of the outcomes during this time interval.

The primary analytic cohort for the group-randomized analysis will be all patients in Panel A and Panel B whose viral load exceeds 1000 copies/mL who have a scheduled primary care appointment during a 7-month enrollment period. Viral load eligible patients in Panel A will be part of the analytic cohort regardless of whether they enroll in the CBI or not. These viral load eligible patients represent the group of patients who are targeted for the main intervention components (CBI and counseling) and, accordingly, will comprise the denominator (estimated to be 2,794) for the primary analysis of the viral load and clinic attendance outcomes. Each cohort member in Panel A is followed for 9 months for purpose of delivering the intervention and assessing the outcomes. Each cohort member in Panel B is followed for 9 months for purpose of assessing the outcomes.

Two secondary levels of analysis will also be performed. First, analysis will be performed focusing on all patients in Panel A clinics who have a viral load over 1000 copies/mL and received at least one administration of the CBI (""as-treated"" approach).

The project will provide enhanced training in evidence-based behavioral health interventions to school-based mental health providers.

The services will be implemented by STS Master's level therapists supervised by their mental health agency supervisors (Internal Support), who are in turn supported by the research team (TT) or external consultants (TT+).

Population: 18 schools in Philadelphia will be chosen for participation. Students who present excessive anxiety in grades 4-8 would be potentially eligible to participate in the interventions offered by the agencies' therapists in their school.

Intervention: This study is designed to test: a) the effectiveness of an adapted version of a group cognitive behavioral therapy program (aFRIENDS) compared to the original version of this program (FRIENDS), and b) the effectiveness of two implementation support strategies for aFRIENDS: Train-the-Trainer and Train-the-Trainer Plus. aFRIENDS is a shorter, more culturally sensitive, focused, and feasible CBT for anxiety in children than FRIENDS and addresses one of the major barriers to implementation (intervention-context fit).

Design: Therapists and supervisors will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a) FRIENDS with Train-the-Trainer implementation strategy (i.e., Masters-level supervisors receive training by experts on conducting supervision); b) aFRIENDS with Train-the-Trainer strategy; c) aFRIENDS using the Train-the-Trainer Plus strategy (i.e., supervisors receive training and consultation by experts on conducting supervision).

Analyses: Effectiveness will be measured by comparing A to B; Implementation will be measured by comparing B to C. Agency therapists will conduct all treatment groups in the schools.","Inclusion Criteria:

1. Supervisors: Any participating agency clinical supervisor with a Master's degree or higher in a mental health field.
2. Therapists: Any STS therapist with a Bachelor's degree or higher who provides services in one of the 18 participating schools.
3. Students: Any student enrolled in grades 4-8 in one of the participating schools, who had been referred to the STS program in their school and who meets study screening and diagnostic criteria. The screening criterion is a Total score \> 25 on Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) completed by a parent or school staff member. This student must also present a primary positive or intermediate diagnosis of Separation Anxiety Disorder (SAD\]) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), or Social Phobia (SP) on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS); completed by a parent during the eligibility evaluation.
4. If, at the conclusion of the eligibility evaluation, students do not meet diagnostic criteria (see above) to participate in the study, but parents and school staff continue to express concern about functional impairment, students will be permitted to participate in the intervention sessions (with parent permission). We also expect that there might be a very small number of eligible children whose parents may not give consent, and some of these parents and school personnel might want these children to benefit from the intervention. As such, we would like to offer these children the opportunity to participate along with the research subjects. This group of students will not be identified as ""research subjects"" and study data will not be collected from them.

This project will expand the capacity of selected mental health agencies to provide services in the participating schools through school therapeutic services (STS). The project will provide enhanced training in evidence-based behavioral health interventions to school-based mental health providers. The services will be implemented by STS Bachelor's or Master's level therapists supervised by their mental health agency supervisors (Internal Support), who are in turn supported by the research team (Train-the-Trainer) or external consultants (Train the Trainer+). Background/Purpose: This project will expand the capacity of selected mental health agencies to provide services in the participating schools through school therapeutic services (STS). The project will provide enhanced training in evidence-based behavioral health interventions to school-based mental health providers. The services will be implemented by STS Master's level therapists supervised by their mental health agency supervisors (Internal Support), who are in turn supported by the research team (TT) or external consultants (TT+). Population: 18 schools in Philadelphia will be chosen for participation. Students who present excessive anxiety in grades 4-8 would be potentially eligible to participate in the interventions offered by the agencies' therapists in their school. Intervention: This study is designed to test: a) the effectiveness of an adapted version of a group cognitive behavioral therapy program (aFRIENDS) compared to the original version of this program (FRIENDS), and b) the effectiveness of two implementation support strategies for aFRIENDS: Train-the-Trainer and Train-the-Trainer Plus. aFRIENDS is a shorter, more culturally sensitive, focused, and feasible CBT for anxiety in children than FRIENDS and addresses one of the major barriers to implementation (intervention-context fit). Design: Therapists and supervisors will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a) FRIENDS with Train-the-Trainer implementation strategy (i.e., Masters-level supervisors receive training by experts on conducting supervision); b) aFRIENDS with Train-the-Trainer strategy; c) aFRIENDS using the Train-the-Trainer Plus strategy (i.e., supervisors receive training and consultation by experts on conducting supervision). Analyses: Effectiveness will be measured by comparing A to B; Implementation will be measured by comparing B to C. Agency therapists will conduct all treatment groups in the schools. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Supervisors: Any participating agency clinical supervisor with a Master's degree or higher in a mental health field. 2. Therapists: Any STS therapist with a Bachelor's degree or higher who provides services in one of the 18 participating schools. 3. Students: Any student enrolled in grades 4-8 in one of the participating schools, who had been referred to the STS program in their school and who meets study screening and diagnostic criteria. The screening criterion is a Total score \> 25 on Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) completed by a parent or school staff member. This student must also present a primary positive or intermediate diagnosis of Separation Anxiety Disorder (SAD\]) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), or Social Phobia (SP) on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS); completed by a parent during the eligibility evaluation. 4. If, at the conclusion of the eligibility evaluation, students do not meet diagnostic criteria (see above) to participate in the study, but parents and school staff continue to express concern about functional impairment, students will be permitted to participate in the intervention sessions (with parent permission). We also expect that there might be a very small number of eligible children whose parents may not give consent, and some of these parents and school personnel might want these children to benefit from the intervention. As such, we would like to offer these children the opportunity to participate along with the research subjects. This group of students will not be identified as ""research subjects"" and study data will not be collected from them. However, parents will be asked to sign a permission form for the video recording of the group sessions. This is the procedure we currently follow for our National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) funded project, which has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and School District of Philadelphia. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Supervisors or therapists not involved in STS. 2. Students with Special Education classification of ""Intellectual Disability;"" children whose primary diagnosis is not SAD, GAS or SP. 3. Students with a history of psychotic or autistic spectrum disorders according to school records. * Students meeting criteria in #2 \& #3 above will be excluded from participation because they would be unlikely to benefit from Global Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (GCBTS). Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any violations of these criteria must be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures.",OTHER
Aarhus University Hospital,OTHER,NCT02028702,Alternative Treatments for Menopausal Women,Alternative Treatments for Menopausal Women: The Efficacy of a Novel Red Clover Treatment on Menopausal Women.,"To investigate the reported health benefits (lipid profile, inflammatory factors, cardiovascular status and bone density) of a novel, phytoestrogen rich, Red Clover treatment on women suffering from both menopause related primary (hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbance and weight gain) and secondary (osteoporosis, cardiovascular and changes in lipid metabolism) symptoms.","Menopausal symptoms are a common phenomenon causing discomfort to many middle aged women throughout the world. The core symptoms are experienced as hot flushes (HF), night sweats, vaginal dryness and sleep disturbance. Other secondary symptoms are sexual dysfunction, depression, anxiety, memory loss, fatigue, headache, joint pains and weight gain. Moreover there is increased risk of further complications such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular and negative changes in lipid profile associated with the reduction in oestrogen during and post menopause.

Trifolium Pratense or Red Clover (RC) has arisen as a popular source for women experiencing HF because it contains a variety of phytoestrogen's, namely isoflavones, lignans and coumestans. Phytoestrogens are shown to have positive effects on menopausal disorders such as breast cancer, cardiovascular risk factors, osteoporosis and have been shown to exert non-hormonal antioxidant effects. Additionally these isoflavones appear to reduce bone resorbtion, help maintain bone mineral density and improve lipid profile (reducing LDL: HDL, lipoprotein A, total cholesterol and may also reduce triglycerides).

RC is particularly high in estrogenic isoflavones biochanin A, formononetin and to a lesser degree genestein and diadzein, although the two former are precursors to genestein and diadzein. Asian populations with a high intake of soy (rich in genestein and diadzein) have long shown a lower reported incidence of the symptoms of menopause.

The study will be carried out as a 3-month parallel randomized control intervention study, consisting of 61 menopausal women. During summer 2012, 61 participants will be randomised into 2 groups (\~30-31 in each group). The two groups are as follows:

Determine the event-free survival at 12 months of pediatric patients' eyes with group D intraocular retinoblastoma treated with systemic chemotherapy comprising vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide, subtenon carboplatin, and local ophthalmic therapy. (Event defined for each eye individually as needed for nonprotocol therapy including nonprotocol chemotherapy, enucleation or any external-beam radiation)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the event-free survival at 12 months of pediatric patients' eyes with group C retinoblastoma treated with systemic chemotherapy comprising carboplatin, etoposide, vincristine, subtenon carboplatin, and local ophthalmic therapy.

II. Determine the acute and long-term toxic effects of these regimens in these patients, including visual outcome and incidence of secondary malignancies.

III. Determine the patterns of failure in patients treated with these regimens, in terms of vitreous vs retinal vs both as sites of recurrence.

IV. Determine predictors of failure including findings at the on study examination under anesthesia and response status after six courses of chemotherapy.

V. Determine the percentage of group C and D eyes separately that can be preserved without enucleation after failing protocol therapy.

Stanford University,OTHER,NCT05107479,Effectiveness of Interactive Voice Response for COVID-19 Vaccination Training in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,Effectiveness of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) for COVID-19 Vaccination Training of Frontline Health Workers: Experimental Evidence From the Democratic Republic of the Congo,"This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of a remote training course delivered via interactive voice response (IVR) to the mobile phones of frontline providers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The randomized trial will examine the impact of the training on health workers' knowledge, beliefs and intended behaviors related to COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine administration. Potential enrollees will be consented first, after which the participants assigned to the treatment group will be invited to participate in the training over a one month period, while the control group will receive the intervention following a month delay, which will allow for the comparison of knowledge and beliefs with a group that is controlled for bias introduced by time. We hypothesize that the training will lead to increased knowledge about vaccines, lower vaccine hesitancy, and increased preparedness to administer vaccines among trained health workers.","Background:

As COVID-19 continues to pose a significant threat worldwide, training health workers to administer the COVID-19 vaccine and encourage uptake of the vaccine is essential to limiting the number of deaths and ultimately ending the pandemic. Providing adequate training to health workers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) had already been logistically and economically challenging, but the onset of the pandemic has intensified the challenge of providing critical and rapidly evolving health information to health workers at a time when it is needed most, particularly in low bandwidth areas where access to accurate sources of information are limited.

A growing body of research suggests that effective and efficient training can be provided through mobile health (mHealth) solutions. The rapid expansion of mobile phone technology available throughout LMICs has enabled the scaling of health education delivery via mobile phone. However, while app-based learning has grown in popularity, drawbacks include limited access to smartphones and the data costs to access the internet, if available. Interactive voice response (IVR) systems pose an alternative solution by employing pre-recorded audio files in local languages, allowing users to receive information from mobile phones without the need for internet access.

Aims:

In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of an IVR training intervention for improving knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine administration among health workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We will also examine differences in effectiveness across subgroups including by geographic region, professional roles (e.g., nurses, physicians) and type of health worker facility.

Methods:

We are collaborating with Viamo, a global social enterprise that has established IVR systems in more than 23 countries, to conduct a randomized controlled trial to measure the effects of the IVR remote training on health workers' knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines and preparedness to administer vaccines. In coordination with the DRC Ministry of Health, Viamo has identified roughly 9,000 facility-based health workers prioritized for participation. Participants will be randomized 1:1 into a treatment and a control group, stratified by geographic region and professional roles to ensure equal representation across regions and types of health workers.

The participants in the treatment group will receive the intervention at the start of the study while the participants in the control group will receive the intervention following a one-month delay, which will allow for the comparison of knowledge, attitudes and practices with a group that is controlled for bias introduced by time. The duration of the study for participants will be roughly one month, which is the time it takes to complete the 5 required IVR training modules and a baseline and endline survey.

Intervention:

Training content is being developed by Viamo in collaboration with the Stanford Center for Health Education and the DRC Ministry of Public Health. The intervention consists of 5 IVR-based modules conveying information about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine administration best practices. Module topics include the following: 1) the importance of COVID-19 vaccines and recipient eligibility, 2) overview of and differences between approved COVID-19 vaccines , 3) surveillance of adverse vaccine events, 4) organizing a vaccination site, and safe storage and handling COVID-19 vaccines, and 5) micro planning and communication strategies for COVID-19 vaccination efforts. The training will be offered in five local languages: French, Lingala, Swahili, Kikongo, and Tshiluba.

Sample size calculation:

The DRC Ministry of Health identified roughly 9,000 health workers located in 13 focal provinces for prioritization of the training. With a total sample size of 9,000 (including both arms), we estimate a minimum detectable effect size (MDES) of 5.6 percentage points (at 80 percent power and a 5 percent significance level). Because of the voluntary nature of the IVR training participation, we anticipate a response rate of lower than 50 percent. At 80 percent power and 5 percent significance, a sample size of 2900 participants (over both arms) is needed to detect a 10 percent difference.

Data collection and training:

Data will be collected via the IVR platform. Treatment and control groups will complete a baseline and endline survey administered at the same time. The baseline survey will include a brief knowledge assessment, questions about participants' vaccination status, beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines, and preparedness to administer vaccines. The baseline also includes demographic and background questions about participants' prior work experience. The endline survey includes a more extensive knowledge assessment and questions about participants' vaccination status, beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines, and preparedness to administer vaccines.

All surveys will be completed directly by participants via IVR calls direct to participants' mobile phones. Surveys and training content will include audio prompts to overcome literacy barriers and will be offered in one of five local languages, selected by participants directly.

Participants will be trained on how to use the IVR technology on their mobile devices at the start of the study. Callers interact with pre-recorded audio files in their local languages and can choose what information they want to receive using their mobile phone keypads (""For more information on prevention, please press 1"").

While the intervention group will be invited to begin the IVR training immediately after completing the baseline survey, the control arm will have a roughly one month delay before receiving the intervention. Besides the short delay, every aspect for treatment and control arms will remain the same.

Data Analysis:

The primary analysis will be based on intention-to-treat at the unit of the individual CHW. The analysis will include randomization strata fixed effects and control for baseline covariates to improve precision of estimates. Because we will have granular by-module completion data across participants, we will also conduct a treatment-on-the-treated instrumental variables analysis to examine the impact of the training on outcomes, among participants completing the training.","Inclusion Criteria:

The randomized trial will examine the impact of the training on health workers' knowledge, beliefs and intended behaviors related to COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine administration. Potential enrollees will be consented first, after which the participants assigned to the treatment group will be invited to participate in the training over a one month period, while the control group will receive the intervention following a month delay, which will allow for the comparison of knowledge and beliefs with a group that is controlled for bias introduced by time. We hypothesize that the training will lead to increased knowledge about vaccines, lower vaccine hesitancy, and increased preparedness to administer vaccines among trained health workers. Background: As COVID-19 continues to pose a significant threat worldwide, training health workers to administer the COVID-19 vaccine and encourage uptake of the vaccine is essential to limiting the number of deaths and ultimately ending the pandemic. Providing adequate training to health workers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) had already been logistically and economically challenging, but the onset of the pandemic has intensified the challenge of providing critical and rapidly evolving health information to health workers at a time when it is needed most, particularly in low bandwidth areas where access to accurate sources of information are limited. A growing body of research suggests that effective and efficient training can be provided through mobile health (mHealth) solutions. The rapid expansion of mobile phone technology available throughout LMICs has enabled the scaling of health education delivery via mobile phone. However, while app-based learning has grown in popularity, drawbacks include limited access to smartphones and the data costs to access the internet, if available. Interactive voice response (IVR) systems pose an alternative solution by employing pre-recorded audio files in local languages, allowing users to receive information from mobile phones without the need for internet access. Aims: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of an IVR training intervention for improving knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine administration among health workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We will also examine differences in effectiveness across subgroups including by geographic region, professional roles (e.g., nurses, physicians) and type of health worker facility. Methods: We are collaborating with Viamo, a global social enterprise that has established IVR systems in more than 23 countries, to conduct a randomized controlled trial to measure the effects of the IVR remote training on health workers' knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines and preparedness to administer vaccines. In coordination with the DRC Ministry of Health, Viamo has identified roughly 9,000 facility-based health workers prioritized for participation. Participants will be randomized 1:1 into a treatment and a control group, stratified by geographic region and professional roles to ensure equal representation across regions and types of health workers. The participants in the treatment group will receive the intervention at the start of the study while the participants in the control group will receive the intervention following a one-month delay, which will allow for the comparison of knowledge, attitudes and practices with a group that is controlled for bias introduced by time. The duration of the study for participants will be roughly one month, which is the time it takes to complete the 5 required IVR training modules and a baseline and endline survey. Intervention: Training content is being developed by Viamo in collaboration with the Stanford Center for Health Education and the DRC Ministry of Public Health. The intervention consists of 5 IVR-based modules conveying information about COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine administration best practices. Module topics include the following: 1) the importance of COVID-19 vaccines and recipient eligibility, 2) overview of and differences between approved COVID-19 vaccines , 3) surveillance of adverse vaccine events, 4) organizing a vaccination site, and safe storage and handling COVID-19 vaccines, and 5) micro planning and communication strategies for COVID-19 vaccination efforts. The training will be offered in five local languages: French, Lingala, Swahili, Kikongo, and Tshiluba. Sample size calculation: The DRC Ministry of Health identified roughly 9,000 health workers located in 13 focal provinces for prioritization of the training. With a total sample size of 9,000 (including both arms), we estimate a minimum detectable effect size (MDES) of 5.6 percentage points (at 80 percent power and a 5 percent significance level). Because of the voluntary nature of the IVR training participation, we anticipate a response rate of lower than 50 percent. At 80 percent power and 5 percent significance, a sample size of 2900 participants (over both arms) is needed to detect a 10 percent difference. Data collection and training: Data will be collected via the IVR platform. Treatment and control groups will complete a baseline and endline survey administered at the same time. The baseline survey will include a brief knowledge assessment, questions about participants' vaccination status, beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines, and preparedness to administer vaccines. The baseline also includes demographic and background questions about participants' prior work experience. The endline survey includes a more extensive knowledge assessment and questions about participants' vaccination status, beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines, and preparedness to administer vaccines. All surveys will be completed directly by participants via IVR calls direct to participants' mobile phones. Surveys and training content will include audio prompts to overcome literacy barriers and will be offered in one of five local languages, selected by participants directly. Participants will be trained on how to use the IVR technology on their mobile devices at the start of the study. Callers interact with pre-recorded audio files in their local languages and can choose what information they want to receive using their mobile phone keypads (""For more information on prevention, please press 1""). While the intervention group will be invited to begin the IVR training immediately after completing the baseline survey, the control arm will have a roughly one month delay before receiving the intervention. Besides the short delay, every aspect for treatment and control arms will remain the same. Data Analysis: The primary analysis will be based on intention-to-treat at the unit of the individual CHW. The analysis will include randomization strata fixed effects and control for baseline covariates to improve precision of estimates. Because we will have granular by-module completion data across participants, we will also conduct a treatment-on-the-treated instrumental variables analysis to examine the impact of the training on outcomes, among participants completing the training.

In 2002, the criminal justice system was the source of referral for 36% of all substance abuse treatment admissions, the largest source of referrals. Heroin use among offenders has serious health and social consequences. Injection, still the primary route of administration among heroin users, is strongly associated with the transmission of HIV, hepatitis C and other blood-borne diseases. During 1997, 20% to 26% of all people living with HIV in the United States, and 29% to 43% of all those infected with hepatitis C, passed through a correctional facility. The relationship between heroin use and criminal activity has been extensively documented. Although methadone maintenance has been the primary treatment for chronic opioid dependence since the 1970's, correctional systems in the U.S., with very few exceptions (primarily Rikers Island in New York City), have not provided institutional access to methadone maintenance. Regrettably, negative attitudes to methadone are prevalent among criminal justice professionals, the public, treatment providers and opioid-dependent offenders themselves; there is little prospect of that changing soon. Buprenorphine maintenance is a recently approved therapy that may be more acceptable than methadone to the criminal justice system and opioid-dependent offenders. With one minor exception, buprenorphine has never been systematically administered as an opioid replacement therapy in a correctional setting in the U.S.

Aims and Objectives:

1. To determine the feasibility of providing buprenorphine maintenance to opioid-dependent offenders in a jail setting and of transitioning those patients to buprenorphine maintenance in the community after their release.
2. To conduct a randomized clinical trial of buprenorphine maintenance (N=50) vs. methadone maintenance (N=50) initiated in the jail setting and continuing in the community.
3. To determine the reasons that offenders fail to report for community buprenorphine or methadone treatment after release or drop out of community treatment.

Study Design: Consenting eligible inmates at Rikers Island in New York City will be randomly assigned to buprenorphine or methadone maintenance in jail and will be referred to a corresponding community treatment upon their release. Subjects will be followed-up at 3 months after release from jail.

Previous studies have been informative, but they have evaluated candidate graphic warnings, not constituent disclosures. Furthermore, they typically expose participants to messages in controlled but artificial experimental settings for a short period of time, using much lower frequency and shorter duration of message exposure than found in the real world. This study addresses these issues by evaluating the impact of constituent disclosures by randomly assigning smokers to have their cigarette packs labeled with constituent disclosure messages or cigarette butt littering messages.","Federal law requires the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to disseminate information about tobacco constituents. The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act grants FDA broad authority to regulate tobacco products, including helping the public to better understand harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) present in tobacco products and tobacco smoke. According to Section 206 of the Act, using the appropriate federal rulemaking channels and procedures, FDA may require disclosure of tobacco constituents if the disclosed information benefits public health and increases consumer awareness of the health consequences of tobacco products. This study will assess the impact of constituent disclosures on smokers' cigarette packs in a randomized control trial.

Recruitment: Smokers will first undergo screening online or call the study center to complete the screening questionnaire over the phone. Study staff will schedule eligible smokers for 5 in-person visits. For each of their 5 visits, smokers will be asked to bring the number of cigarettes they expect to smoke in an 8 day period.

Informed Consent: Prior to consenting smokers, research staff will visually inspect photo identification of smokers who report or appear to be under age 27. At the beginning of the first appointment, study personnel will explain the consent form and ask the smoker to read the form. Once the participant has finished reading the form, the study personnel member will ask the participant if he or she has any questions. Then both parties will sign the consent form and the participant will receive a copy of the consent form.

Randomization: At the week 2 visit, study personnel will randomly assign participants to one of the two study arms. The investigators will determine the randomization order a priori. Smokers have an equal chance of being randomized to have labels with constituent disclosure messages or labels with litter messages applied to their cigarette packs.

Assessment: Participants will complete 5 computer-based surveys during the study. The first appointment will take around 60 minutes and each subsequent visit will take around 30-45 minutes to complete. At all 5 visits, participants will complete a survey. At visits 2-4, participants' will have their cigarette packs labeled based on their condition. Cigarette packs will be tracked at all 5 study visits.

Detailed description of the intervention: Each week participants will bring in 8 days' of cigarettes (one extra day to provide a buffer in case of rescheduled appointments or smoking more than anticipated) for labeling and tracking. Additionally, they will bring in any unused labeled packs from the previous visit when applicable. While participants are taking the survey, research staff will count participants' cigarette packs. Study staff will mark packs with a code indicating the date of the visit and label them.

Participants randomized to the intervention arm will have labels with constituent disclosure messages applied to their cigarette packs during visits for weeks 2-4. Constituent disclosures that include text about chemicals in cigarette smoke and health effects of the chemicals will be applied to participants' cigarette packs as labels on the right side (the Surgeon General's warning is on the left side).

Given the cultural differences between Asian and Western communities, the applicability of the findings to paediatric cancer survivors in Asian cultural contexts is limited. To date, research remains scant regarding the needs and challenges of Hong Kong Chinese paediatric cancer survivors and the key stakeholders involved during the transition period after cancer treatment. Although Hong Kong paediatric cancer survivors do attend regular medical follow-up visits, most attention has been focused on their physiological care, while their psychosocial needs remain unmet. Accordingly, the aim of this proposed study will be to fill the gaps in knowledge regarding the effects of cancer and its treatment, especially will focus on psychosocial effects in Hong Kong Chinese paediatric cancer survivors during the transition period.

Design and subjects: A qualitative descriptive design will be used. A purposive sample of 15 paediatric cancer survivor participants and their parents or caregivers, five paediatric oncology nurses and three paediatric oncologists will be invited for a semi-structured interview conducted with the aid of an interview guide.

Data analysis: A thematic analysis approach will be used for data analysis.

Objectives: Although increasing attention has been devoted to the development of paediatric cancer survivorship programmes, most of these studies have originated in Western countries. Given the cultural differences between Asian and Western communities, the applicability of the findings to paediatric cancer survivors in Asian cultural contexts is limited. To date, research remains scant regarding the needs and challenges of Hong Kong Chinese paediatric cancer survivors and the key stakeholders involved during the transition period after cancer treatment. Although Hong Kong paediatric cancer survivors do attend regular medical follow-up visits, most attention has been focused on their physiological care, while their psychosocial needs remain unmet. Accordingly, the aim of this proposed study will be to fill the gaps in knowledge regarding the effects of cancer and its treatment, especially will focus on psychosocial effects in Hong Kong Chinese paediatric cancer survivors during the transition period. Design and subjects: A qualitative descriptive design will be used. A purposive sample of 15 paediatric cancer survivor participants and their parents or caregivers, five paediatric oncology nurses and three paediatric oncologists will be invited for a semi-structured interview conducted with the aid of an interview guide. Data analysis: A thematic analysis approach will be used for data analysis. Expected results: The findings of this study will provide an in-depth understanding of the needs, challenges and views of paediatric cancer survivors and other key stakeholders, which will greatly facilitate the future development of appropriate targeted paediatric cancer survivorship programmes.

CN54gp140 and GLA will be mixed together before administration, and immunogens will be delivered in combination regimens","This is a phase I study exploring the safety and potency of five HIV vaccines in healthy volunteers. The main aim is to see whether three of the five vaccines can be given together rather than one after the other, in five rather than seven sets of vaccinations and a course shortened by eight weeks. All volunteers will receive three injections of the first two vaccines (DNA plasmids) and half will be randomly assigned to receive two injections each of the second (MVA-C) and subsequent vaccines (CN54rgp140 mixed with GLA-AF) during the same visit or two injections of the MVA-C followed by two of CN54rgp140 mixed with GLA-AF.

The investigators are interested in ensuring that the vaccines are safe and also that the immune responses in the two groups of volunteers are similar. The three vaccines have all been shown to stimulate the immune response to specific parts of the HIV virus and none are infectious. The first vaccine consists of two DNA plasmids. When injected into muscle cells small parts of the HIV virus which are encoded by the DNA are produced and these are then recognised by the immune system. The second vaccine MVAC, is derived from vaccinia virus which has been modified so that it cannot divide. The virus (Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)) actually expresses the same portions of HIV as the DNA and results in amplification of the responses seen. The third vaccine is a synthetically produced component of the HIV viral outer coat and it will be administered with an additive which has been shown to greatly enhance particular types of immune response which have recently been shown to play a role in protection against infection","Inclusion Criteria:

This will be performed by evaluating Peptest results in GERD patients (Erosive esophagitis or NERD), defined using standard clinical procedures, and compared to healthy controls.","Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) mainly manifests as three types, erosive esophagitis (EE), non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and Barrett's esophagus. EE is characterized by damaged distal esophageal mucosa which is visible by endoscope, and also referred to as ""endoscopically positive gastroesophageal reflux disease"". NERD is defined as discomfort related to reflux without any obvious mucosal damage by endoscope, and is also known as ""endoscopically negative gastroesophageal reflux disease"".

At present the diagnosis of GERD uses syndrome-based diagnosis, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) test, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, endoscopy, etc. However, some of the above methods lack specificity and some may bring great suffering to patients due to being invasive (e.g., 24-hour esophagus pH monitoring). The disadvantage of endoscopy lies in its low detection rate, only 2.95% to 4.1% as NERD is the most frequent diagnosis. Therefore, diagnosis based on GERD syndromes still remains one of the most common diagnostic methods. In recent years, questionnaire surveys about GERD have been carried out at abroad, aiming at finding a simple and feasible diagnostic method. As one of the worlds's most recognized and commonly used diagnostic scale for the diagnosis of GERD, reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ) is a survey of medical history mainly based on symptom score. Studies at both home and abroad have confirmed its validity and reliability in the diagnosis of GERD. The reflux symptom index (RSI) is a validated questionnaire used to confirm the presence (or absence) of extra-esophageal reflux that are atypical symptoms of reflux that control subjects may overlook.

Peptest (Human Pepsin lateral flow in vitro diagnostic medical device) can be used in clinic for fast and convenient pepsin detection in patients' saliva. Pepsin, detected from saliva samples, can be regarded as a marker of a reflux event for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Peptest (Human Pepsin lateral flow in vitro diagnostic medical device) produced by RD Biomed Limited is equivalent to other GERD diagnostic methods commonly applied in clinical practice by testing a large number of clinical samples.

GERD patients and controls will provide saliva samples and these will be tested for the presence of pepsin using Peptest. Peptest results (positive or negative) will be evaluated in GERD patients (Erosive esophagitis or NERD) defined using standard clinical diagnostic tools and compared to controls (confirmed to not have reflux using two validated questionnaires).","Inclusion Criteria:

There are currently no licensed, variant-optimized vaccines to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron/BA.2. Approved or authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are expensive, require a stringent cold chain, and have large-scale manufacturing issues, resulting in very limited availability in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given the rapid global spread of the Omicron/BA.2 variant and potential for future novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, the rapid development of an easy-to-manufacture and easy-to-distribute vaccine is of great importance.

The objective of the study is to assess the tolerability, safety, and immunogenicity of different doses and routes of administration of the Alveavax-v1.2 vaccine in healthy individuals.

The study aims to evaluate:

* the safety and tolerability of Alveavax-v1.2 in healthy participants compared to a control booster vaccine in a dose-finding design;
* the immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 BA.2/Omicron after a booster dose of Alveavax-v1.2;
* the clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 after a booster dose of Alveavax-v1.2;
* and the success rate of intradermal (ID) injections.","This is a first in human, open-label, active-controlled, randomized dose-finding study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of intradermal (ID) and subcutaneous (SC) application of the plasmid DNA SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 vaccine Alveavax-v1.2 in primary Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated healthy individuals.

Primary Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated participants will be randomized into one of 5 treatment arms to receive Alveavax-v1.2 or a Ad26.COV2.S control booster vaccine.

Participants will be enrolled at multiple sites in South Africa within 28 days after the initial screening to ensure they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

Each participant will be administered a booster vaccine on Day 1 of the study and will be monitored afterwards. Solicited local/systemic reactions will be recorded after vaccination in the participant's diary card for up to 7 days (the vaccine administration day and 6 days later).

A total of 130 participants of any sex, aged between 18 and 65 years, who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria are planned to be enrolled in five groups and with vaccine administered according to their dose arm as follows:

Low dose: 0.5 mg Alveavax-v1.2 in one ID injection

Standard dose: 2 mg Alveavax-v1.2 in one ID injection

High dose: 8mg Alveavax-v1.2 in four ID injections

SC injection: 8mg Alveavax-v1.2 in one SC injection

There are currently no licensed, variant-optimized vaccines to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron/BA.2. Approved or authorized SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are expensive, require a stringent cold chain, and have large-scale manufacturing issues, resulting in very limited availability in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given the rapid global spread of the Omicron/BA.2 variant and potential for future novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, the rapid development of an easy-to-manufacture and easy-to-distribute vaccine is of great importance. The objective of the study is to assess the tolerability, safety, and immunogenicity of different doses and routes of administration of the Alveavax-v1.2 vaccine in healthy individuals. The study aims to evaluate: * the safety and tolerability of Alveavax-v1.2 in healthy participants compared to a control booster vaccine in a dose-finding design; * the immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 BA.2/Omicron after a booster dose of Alveavax-v1.2; * the clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 after a booster dose of Alveavax-v1.2; * and the success rate of intradermal (ID) injections. This is a first in human, open-label, active-controlled, randomized dose-finding study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of intradermal (ID) and subcutaneous (SC) application of the plasmid DNA SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 vaccine Alveavax-v1.2 in primary Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated healthy individuals. Primary Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated participants will be randomized into one of 5 treatment arms to receive Alveavax-v1.2 or a Ad26.COV2.S control booster vaccine. Participants will be enrolled at multiple sites in South Africa within 28 days after the initial screening to ensure they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving antithymocyte globulin before transplant and cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methotrexate before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

PURPOSE: Natural Killer (NK) cells from the donor's bone marrow may be important in fighting leukemia. Bone marrow donors can be selected based on the type of NK cells they have, specifically the killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) type. This study provides information on KIR type from potential donors, which can be used in selecting the bone marrow donor.

* To correlate the relationships between factors affecting NK receptor status and clinical events.
* To assess NK-cell development after URD and UCB HCT in patients with poor prognosis AML.
* To evaluate NK-cell reconstitution and receptor-acquisition pattern in these patients.

  * Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation: Conditioning regimen, infusion procedures, and post-transplant immunoprophylaxis for patients with an UCB donor are according to institutional guidelines and standards.
* Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplant: Patients undergo allogeneic SCT or UCB transplant on day 0.
* Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine or tacrolimus IV or orally beginning on day -2 and continuing until day 50, followed by a taper until week 24. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

The investigators hypothesize that families randomly assigned to receive the intervention, compared to families not receiving the intervention, will show improved brain function for attention and self-regulation and improved physiological function for stress regulation in both children and their parents, improvements in child school performance and cognition, and improvements in assessments of parent/family well being.","Based on basic research on the neuroplasticity of attention, stress, and family dynamics, the investigators developed a successful dual-generation intervention that targets attention, stress, and self-regulation. The intervention has been shown to improve brain function for attention, cognition, and behavior in preschool children in Head Start (HS) and also improves communication skills and reduces stress in parents. This project involves the development of a scaled-up model of this intervention working with with Head Start of Lane County (HSOLC).

Goal 1: In partnership with HSOLC, the investigators have developed a scaled-up model of the intervention that is delivered by HS specialists and sustainable and replicable by other HS programs. This intervention is called Creating Connections: Strong Families, Strong Brains (CC).

Goal 2: To characterize the degree to which CC improves distal outcomes related to parent/family well-being by assessing health and safety outcomes in parents and children, parental education, financial literacy and decision making, household chaos, and biomarkers of allostatic load related to health outcomes.

Goal 3: To evaluate hypothesized mediating factors related to changes in family well-being, specifically changes in foundational systems (stress and self-regulation) by refining measures of family stress and self-regulation by assessing heart rate variability in parents and children and neurophysiological measures of self-regulation in parents.

Children and parents at randomly assigned HSOLC sites will receive CC, and other HSOLC sites will deliver the regular HS curriculum. The investigators hypothesize that participation in CC will result in improved brain function for attention and self-regulation as well as improved physiological function for stress regulation in both children and their parents compared to families not receiving the intervention.","Inclusion Criteria:

The investigators hypothesize that families randomly assigned to receive the intervention, compared to families not receiving the intervention, will show improved brain function for attention and self-regulation and improved physiological function for stress regulation in both children and their parents, improvements in child school performance and cognition, and improvements in assessments of parent/family well being. Based on basic research on the neuroplasticity of attention, stress, and family dynamics, the investigators developed a successful dual-generation intervention that targets attention, stress, and self-regulation. The intervention has been shown to improve brain function for attention, cognition, and behavior in preschool children in Head Start (HS) and also improves communication skills and reduces stress in parents. This project involves the development of a scaled-up model of this intervention working with with Head Start of Lane County (HSOLC). Goal 1: In partnership with HSOLC, the investigators have developed a scaled-up model of the intervention that is delivered by HS specialists and sustainable and replicable by other HS programs. This intervention is called Creating Connections: Strong Families, Strong Brains (CC). Goal 2: To characterize the degree to which CC improves distal outcomes related to parent/family well-being by assessing health and safety outcomes in parents and children, parental education, financial literacy and decision making, household chaos, and biomarkers of allostatic load related to health outcomes. Goal 3: To evaluate hypothesized mediating factors related to changes in family well-being, specifically changes in foundational systems (stress and self-regulation) by refining measures of family stress and self-regulation by assessing heart rate variability in parents and children and neurophysiological measures of self-regulation in parents. Children and parents at randomly assigned HSOLC sites will receive CC, and other HSOLC sites will deliver the regular HS curriculum. The investigators hypothesize that participation in CC will result in improved brain function for attention and self-regulation as well as improved physiological function for stress regulation in both children and their parents compared to families not receiving the intervention.

University of Notre Dame,OTHER,NCT04766879,Spatial Repellents for the Prevention of Malaria in Kenya,A Cluster Randomized Trial of the Efficacy of a Spatial Repellent (the Envelope) on Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria Incidence as Measured by Time to First Infection in Western Kenya,"Spatial repellents are chemical-based devices that when placed in a room, make that room non-conducive for mosquitoes. These tools can be used to help in the fight against vector borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. However, their efficacy in reducing mosquito biting and therefore malaria transmission has never been evaluated in Africa. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a spatial repellent in reducing mosquito biting on human beings and measure the impact any reduced biting will have on malaria transmission. The investigators will recruit and follow-up 5,984 children between 6 months and \<10 years of age in Busia County to determine how many times they will be infected with malaria in villages where the investigators will have distributed spatial repellents and compare the rate of infection to villages where the investigators will not have distributed the repellent devices. Additionally, the investigators will measure whether the distribution of spatial repellents in one village will drive mosquitoes to their neighboring houses thereby increasing malaria transmission in those areas. The children participating in the study will be divided into 3 groups (cohorts). The first group will be followed up during the first 4 months before any intervention is distributed and the purpose here will be to determine that the villages are comparable. After this, the investigators will recruit the next group of participants and follow them up for 1 year and repeat this again for another year. During the follow-up, the children will be asked to come to the health facility where they will be tested for malaria using RDT or blood slide for microscopy. Every two weeks, a member of the study team will come to the participant's house and ask them if they had any history of fever. If the participants had fever, they will be tested for malaria. All children who turn out to be positive for malaria by RDT will be treated free of charge. At the same time, the investigators shall also perform mosquito collections to determine the impact of spatial repellents on the density of Anopheles mosquitoes.","Spatial repellents (SRs) have been widely used for the prevention of mosquito bites but their protective efficacy (PE) in reducing mosquito-borne diseases has never been evaluated in Africa. To address this knowledge gap, western Kenya was selected as a site to estimate the impact of a transfluthrin-based spatial repellent on malaria-related outcomes in Busia County, where baseline malaria transmission ranges from 2.5 to 4.1 new infections per person per year.

A total of 5,984 children between 6 months and \<10 years of age will be enrolled in three separate cohorts (baseline, cohort 1 and cohort 2). A total of 2,040 children from among 60 clusters will be enrolled for a four-month baseline prior to placement of the SR intervention. After baseline, a total of 1,972 participants from among 58 clusters, will be enrolled into cohort 1 and followed for one year. Cohort 2, consisting of a total of 1,972 children, will be enrolled from among 58 clusters to provide a total of two years of follow up. Children who have been selected for inclusion in the baseline cohort will be eligible for selection to cohort 1 or 2 but not both.

Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 during intervention will be split into two groups, one to estimate the direct effect of the SR (total of 1,624 children, 812 per follow up year) and a second to estimate the degree of diversion (or mass effect) of mosquitoes and malaria transmission from persons protected by the SR to persons who are unprotected (total of 2,320 children, 1,160 per follow up year). All cohorts will be followed once every two weeks with finger prick blood samples taken once every 4 weeks to test for malaria or whenever a participant reports a recent (within 48 hours) history of fever.

The incidence of malaria in the baseline cohort will be used to validate underlying assumptions prior to intervention. The incidence of malaria in each cohort followed with intervention will be estimated and compared to determine the benefit of using an SR in an area with high, year-round transmission of malaria. Monthly collections of mosquitoes using CDC light traps will be conducted to determine if there are entomological correlates of SR efficacy that may be useful for the evaluation of new SR products. Quarterly human landing catches will be done to assess the behavioral effects of the SR. The primary hypothesis on PE against the first-time malaria infection will be estimated by comparing the hazard rates of first-time malaria infection between SR and placebo upon the completion of the study in the ITT population.","Inclusion Criteria:

Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is usually defined as a reduction in nociceptive thresholds in the peripheral field of the sensitized fibers \[Koppert et al., 2003\], and it is associated with increased pain and higher demand for postoperative analgesia \[Guignard et al., 2000\].

"The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston",OTHER,NCT03934879,Physical Exercise and Contributors to Academic Performance Among Adolescents With ASD (Fit Club Study),Physical Exercise and Contributors to Academic Performance Among Adolescents With ASD (Fit Club Study),"This study, Physical Exercise and Contributors to Academic Performance among Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), aims to expand our understanding of the impact of regular physical exercise on improvement in academic performance. The investigators will focus on the use of affordable, portable, and achievable interventions that can be easily shared and incorporated into other academic and home settings. The study will examine the use a regular vigorous exercise program for helping students with ASD reduce body mass index and improve executive function, motor performance, sensory responsiveness, and mood. The investigators propose a collaborative arrangement with an area school to conduct an 18-month exploratory pilot study of 30 middle- and high-school aged students (12 to 18 years old) with ASD, who are returning participants or are new to participating in the Fit Club at Gateway Academy. The investigators expect that the changes elicited by participation in this type of exercise program will support the formation of adult life skills, impacting on long-term quality of life for individuals with ASD and children with other conditions.","Detailed Description: Background:

Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) typically have social impairment, have difficulty making decisions and problem solving (executive function) and have impaired motor performance. As a result, they are less likely to even live independently, be employed, go to college or get married. Few effective interventions have been found to help with the complex problems of people with ASD who are unable to establish independent lives. The investigators plan to begin the examination of using a regular physically challenging exercise program to support development of executive function (EF) and motor skills among children and young adults with ASD to improve academic behaviors and participation in adult activities.

In addition to having social, EF and motor problems, children and young adults with ASD often participate in limited physical activities, enjoy them less than do typically developing (TD) children, are less motivated to participate in physical activities than TD children, experience weight gain from medications, and encounter problems with reduced physical fitness and obesity. Lack of interest or motivation to exercise may make it difficult for them to comply with daily physical activity recommendations. As a result, these students are less likely to be involved in physical activity, enjoy fewer types of leisure activities, and experience limited relationships with peers, which eventually contribute to lower levels of participation in adult activities.

Benefits of Physical Activity:

Physical exercise has been shown to improve cognitive processes in TD individuals. It has a positive influence on symptoms seen in children and adolescents with ASD, including experiencing reductions in stereotypical behaviors, improved sensory skills and social responsiveness, improved concentration and memory, weight reduction, improved motor skills, improvement in executive function and a reduction in repetitive behaviors. Many of these skills are necessary for adult tasks such as driving, test-taking, employment, and engaging in other purposeful adult activities. The mechanism of improvement in these cognitive functions as a result of physical exercise is thought to be caused by increased cerebral blood flow, up-regulation of neuroprotective growth factors, and the cardiovascular benefits of exercise, which lead to an improvement in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients. It is not clear, however, if the amount of effort during exercise is related to the improvement in cognitive functions.

Participation: Participation in activities is how children and young adults develop an understanding of the expectations of society and gain the physical and social skills needed to function and flourish, it plays an important role in a child's or young adult's social development, and it influences long-term mental and physical health.

Mood: Having ASD may lead to psychosocial impairments, including depression, anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem. For example, Shtayermman (2008) reported that 50% of study participants with Asperger syndrome had made a suicide attempt, while Paquette-Smith, Weiss, and Lunsky (2014) determined that ""36% suicide attempt rate reported in their sample of 50 adults with Asperger Syndrome was much higher than the national average of 4.6% over a lifetime in the general population"". Using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), components of psychosocial well-being will be assessed in this cohort of children during this study.

Sensory Responsiveness: Children and young adults with ASD demonstrate unusual sensory responses to stimuli more frequently than do typically developing peers or those with other developmental disorders. In a study comparing children with and without ASD, atypical sensory responsiveness patterns greater than one standard deviation from the mean were found in up to 95% in children with ASD, compared to 12 to 25% of children without ASD in the various sensory domains.

Gateway Academy: For this study, the investigators will partner with Gateway Academy, a private school that utilizes innovative approaches to learning, physical fitness, and social awareness, and enrolls approximately 55 students of middle to high school age with social and academic challenges, the majority of whom have an ASD diagnosis. Gateway Academy developed a Fit Club fitness program seven years ago modeled after an exercise program developed by Ratey. In addition, a second school, closely matched to Gateway Academy functional levels, has communicated an interest in participating in the second stage of this study.

Methodology:

Each year, 10 to 15 new students join Gateway Academy who have not participated in an organized, mandatory exercise intervention (Fit Club). With this study, the investigators plan to examine the impact of the Fit Club intervention by comparing students new to the Fit Club intervention throughout the school year, and also by tracking returning students on a range of factors, including BMI, executive function, motor skills, sleep patterns, and classroom behaviors.

The investigators propose to conduct an 18-month exploratory pilot study of 30 middle- and high-school aged students (12 to 18 years old) with ASD, who participate in, or are new to participating in the Fit Club at Gateway Academy. Engagement in exercise and response to exercise will be constantly monitored for participants. Other participant data will be collected three times, once at baseline, at the end of the school year, and at the beginning of the next school year.

The investigators will adhere to the Fit Club fitness program protocol. All students will rotate through each fitness module, which includes spin class, Pilates, strengthening exercises (weight training), basketball, running and rhythm, and cardio fitness. Students will meet five days per week during their first class of the day for 35 minutes and participate in two randomly assigned modules for two week periods. After 2 weeks, they participate in 2 different modules.

Study Objectives:

Objective 1: To determine how students new to the fitness program compare to their returning peers in BMI, executive function, sensory responsiveness, motor skills, mood, and activity participation.

Objective 2: To quantify the changes in BMI, executive function, sensory responsiveness motor skills, and mood after participation in a fitness program after one and two semesters for new and returning students.

Objective 3: To determine if greater physical effort is correlated with greater improvement in BMI, executive function, sensory responsiveness, motor skills, and mood.

Objective 4: To determine if leisure activity participation patterns vary across ages of students and change after two semesters of participation in a fitness program.

Evaluation/Data Analysis:

Data from students will include factors that affect academic performance, including measures of EF, sensory responsiveness, and motor skills. Physiological statistics such as height and weight will be collected to calculate Body Mass Indices (BMI) for each participant over the course of the study. To achieve the greatest validity, assessments have been selected that obtain the perspectives from several sources: parent/LAR report, teacher report and direct observation. Parent, student, and teacher questionnaires will be administered online. All students, teachers, and parents will be able to use computers with access to the internet. Observation assessments will be conducted by graduate occupational therapy students from the University of Texas Medical Branch. A FitBit® activity tracking wristband with a heart rate monitor and wireless syncing capabilities will be worn by participants and will be used to track resting and peak heart rate, calories burned, steps taken, and sleep quality. Outcome constructs and performance measures are listed below.

Study Outcome: Performance Measure ASD Severity: Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition, parent and teacher forms (SRS-2), Sensory Responsiveness: Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile, Motor Performance: Bruininks-Osteretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2), Executive Function: Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, parent and teacher forms (BRIEF), Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS), Participation: Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment \& Preferences for Activities of Children (CAPE/PAC), Life Participation for Parents, Adolescent and Young Adult Activity Card Sort (AYA-ACS), Behavior/Mood: Repetitive Behavior Scale, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Effort:Heart Rate and daily steps taken with activity monitoring wristband, Summer Exercise Questionnaire Metabolic Parameters Height and weight scale, Height in inches, Body temperature with no contact thermometer

Significance:

This research has the potential to change policy regarding physical education for students with ASD. If the results of this study show a strong relationship between the level of physical exertion and improvements in factors affecting academic performance, it will suggest adding more physically exerting activities to school curricula for students with ASD. The positive impact of physical exercise has been observed in previous studies, but this study may help to clarify the relationship between effort during exercise and improvements in the factors that support academic performance. The investigators may also gain understanding of the duration and effort of exercise necessary to see improvements in these factors, and whether the benefits are sustained. Examination of regression from non-adherence over the summer will help clarify the necessity of continuous participation. If a relationship is found between effort and the factors supporting academic performance, it will help to better identify options for interventions to improve those factors in students with ASD. Participation data will build a better understanding of leisure activity participation patterns in adolescents with ASD that will help to guide intervention.","Inclusion Criteria:

Objective 4: To determine if leisure activity participation patterns vary across ages of students and change after two semesters of participation in a fitness program. Data Collection phase of the study. Timeline Months 1 \& 2: Identification of participants, Consents, Baseline data collected (Visit 1) Months 3-9: Fit Club Month 9 (Visit 2) Months 10-12: Summer Break Months13-14: School Start data collection (Visit 3) Months14-18: Data analysis and dissemination Evaluation/Data Analysis: Data from students will include factors that affect academic performance, including measures of EF, sensory responsiveness, and motor skills. Physiological statistics such as height and weight will be collected to calculate Body Mass Indices (BMI) for each participant over the course of the study. To achieve the greatest validity, assessments have been selected that obtain the perspectives from several sources: parent/LAR report, teacher report and direct observation. Parent, student, and teacher questionnaires will be administered online. All students, teachers, and parents will be able to use computers with access to the internet. Observation assessments will be conducted by graduate occupational therapy students from the University of Texas Medical Branch. A FitBit® activity tracking wristband with a heart rate monitor and wireless syncing capabilities will be worn by participants and will be used to track resting and peak heart rate, calories burned, steps taken, and sleep quality. Outcome constructs and performance measures are listed below.

If the results of this study show a strong relationship between the level of physical exertion and improvements in factors affecting academic performance, it will suggest adding more physically exerting activities to school curricula for students with ASD. The positive impact of physical exercise has been observed in previous studies, but this study may help to clarify the relationship between effort during exercise and improvements in the factors that support academic performance. The investigators may also gain understanding of the duration and effort of exercise necessary to see improvements in these factors, and whether the benefits are sustained. Examination of regression from non-adherence over the summer will help clarify the necessity of continuous participation. If a relationship is found between effort and the factors supporting academic performance, it will help to better identify options for interventions to improve those factors in students with ASD. Participation data will build a better understanding of leisure activity participation patterns in adolescents with ASD that will help to guide intervention.

The proposed study is the first clinical trial and prospective study designed to document whether or not 1) Btx-A injection relieves pain in a patient's hand affected with Raynaud's disease better than a placebo within 28 days of injection, and 2) Btx-A injection relieves pain associated with Raynaud's disease for longer than 28 days, improving patients' quality of life. Through this study we intend to further determine the effect of injected Btx-A on relieving chronic pain and ulcerations to the ischemic hand while characterizing the patients for whom this treatment is most effective.","PROJECT SUMMARY OVERVIEW: Treating patients with Raynaud's phenomenon who have chronic pain and ulcerations is extremely challenging. Pharmacologic vasodilators and surgical sympathectomies offer variable benefits. Case reports, small retrospective outcomes studies, and our previous work documenting symptomatic patients treated with botulinum toxin type A (Btx-A) injections for Raynaud's phenomenon have demonstrated relief of pain and healing of ulcerations with minimal adverse effects. We propose to conduct the first clinical trial and prospective study documenting the efficacy of this novel treatment modality.

STUDY AIMS: The aims of this proposal are to 1) examine the short-term efficacy of Btx-A injection compared to placebo in treating pain associated with digit ischemia due to Raynaud's disease, and 2) describe the long-term efficacy of Btx-A injection in treating pain associated with digit ischemia due to Raynaud's disease by measuring patient satisfaction and quality of life changes over time.

APPROACH: Two groups of patients will be enrolled: Group 1 will consist of patients with primary Raynaud's disease (n=20) and Group 2 of patients with secondary Raynaud's (n=20). Comparisons between treatment (Btx) and placebo (saline) will occur during the first 28 days to determine Btx-A's short-term efficacy. Follow-up visits will occur at Days 7 and 28. Post-assessment on Day 28 marks the beginning of the longitudinal observational study of patient outcomes. Placebo will no longer be used and patients still suffering from pain will be eligible for additional Btx-A injections. Patients may receive up to 4 injections of Btx-A during the 1-year study period if pain or ulcerations recur. During the study period participants will be followed to collect data on pain-free intervals, ulcer healing, subsequent treatment choices, patient satisfaction, and changes in quality of life and hand function. Group comparisons will be made to analyze results. Further stratifications for data analysis will be made as enrollment numbers allow to control for additional demographic and disease variables. Quality-adjusted life-years will be calculated to help determine the societal and individual cost of this treatment.

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that 1) Btx-A injection relieves ischemic pain associated with Raynaud's disease better than a placebo within 28 days of injection, and 2) Btx-A injection relieves ischemic pain associated with Raynaud's disease for longer than 28 days, improving patients' quality of life. Through this study we intend to further elucidate the efficacy of injected Btx-A on relieving chronic pain and ulcerations to the ischemic hand while characterizing the patients for whom this treatment is most effective. This data will help us to apply for national funding to become the coordinating center for a multi-center clinical trial. The results of this research have enormous potential to impact millions of patients who suffer with Raynaud's phenomenon.","Inclusion Criteria:

Sheba Medical Center,OTHER_GOV,NCT02821702,Fertility Post Placenta Accrete,Fertility Post Preservative Cesarean Section and Uterine Artery Embolization,This study is the first to investigate the fertility outcome and the influence on ovarian reserve after using uterine artery embolization during cesarean delivery.,"Placenta accreta is an abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall. Three variants of abnormally invasive placentation have been described: placenta accreta, in which placental villi invade the surface of the myometrium; placenta increta, in which placental villi extend into the myometrium; and placenta percreta, where the villi penetrate through the myometrium to the uterine serosa and may invade adjacent organs, such as the bladder.

Placenta accrete is an increasingly prevalent and potentially dangerous complication of pregnancy. It appears to be most strongly predicted by a history of cesarean deliveries and low-lying placenta/previa. Additional risk factors include in vitro fertilization pregnancy, prior myomectomy, Asherman's syndrome, submucous leiomyomata, maternal age older than 35 years, elevated second-trimester levels of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin.

Pregnancies complicated with placenta accrete are associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including life-threatening maternal haemorrhage, large-volume blood transfusion, uterine rupture and peripartum hysterectomy. Moreover , strong association was found between abnormal placentation to significant perinatal morbidity and mortality such as small for gestational age, preterm delivery, neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization, perinatal death and neonatal death.

Prenatal diagnosis and adequate planning, particularly in high-risk populations, is indicated for the reduction of these adverse outcomes. Advances in grayscale and Doppler ultrasound have facilitated prenatal diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging techniques, no diagnostic technique affords the clinician complete assurance of the presence or absence of placenta accreta.

Management of placenta accrete could be conservative (aiming for uterine preservation) or interventional ( elective cesarean hysterectomy ) depending on the patients will to maintain the uterus for future fertility, the degree of placentation abnormality or complications during delivery. The extent (area, depth) of the abnormal attachment will determine the response-curettage, wedge resection, medical management, or hysterectomy. Uterine conserving options may work in small focal accretas, but abdominal hysterectomy usually is the most definitive treatment.

Post-partum hemorrhage is the major concern dealing with placenta accrete. Women with placenta accreta have a higher incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and are more likely to undergo emergency hysterectomy .

If the diagnosis or a strong suspicion is formed before delivery, a number of measures should be taken including counseling the patient about the likelihood of hysterectomy and blood transfusion, preparing blood products and clotting factors and considering using cell saver technology.The appropriate location and timing for delivery should be considered to allow access to adequate surgical personnel and equipment and a preoperative anesthesia assessment should be obtained.

A patient with stable vital signs and persistent bleeding, especially if the rate of loss is not excessive, may be a candidate for arterial embolization. Radiographic identification of bleeding vessels allows embolization with gelfoam, coils, or glue. Balloon occlusion is also a technique used in such circumstances. Embolization can be used for bleeding that continues after hysterectomy or can be used as an alternative to hysterectomy to preserve fertility.

Studies estimating the fertility and pregnancy outcomes after successful conservative treatment for placenta accrete have demonstrated placenta accreta does not appear to compromise the patients' subsequent fertility or obstetrical outcome.

By reviewing the literature, no prospective studies have specifically evaluated fertility, following uterine artery embolization during cesarean section due to placenta accrete .

Women that were operated and fit inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study after getting advanced notice on requirements .

Most of them are due to respiratory failure (e.g., trauma, drowning, respiratory distress), where hypoxia leads to cardiac arrest. Generally, emergency medical services (EMS) first use basic airway management techniques i.e., the use of a bag-valve-mask (BVM) device, to restore oxygenation in pediatric OHCA victims. However, these devices present many drawbacks and limitations. Intermediate airway management, i.e., the use of SGA devices, especially the i-gel® has several advantages. It has been shown to enhance both circulatory and ventilatory parameters. There is increasing evidence that IAM devices can safely be used in children. In two pediatric studies of OHCA, American paramedics had significantly higher success rates with SGA devices than with TI. A neonatal animal model showed that the use of SGA was feasible and non-inferior to TI in this population. However, data regarding the effect of IAM with an i-gel® versus the use of a BVM on ventilation parameters during pediatric OHCA is missing. The hypothesis underlying this study is that, in case of pediatric OHCA, early insertion of an i-gel® device without prior BVM ventilation should improve ventilation parameters in comparison with the standard approach consisting in BVM ventilations.","Pediatric cardiac arrest is a high-risk, low-frequency event associated with death or severe neurological sequelae in survivors. Most occur in the prehospital setting. Despite advances in resuscitation science and survival improvement over the last decades, survival remains low, with only approximately 6% to 20% of children surviving to hospital discharge after pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Most triggers of pediatric OHCA are respiratory in nature, with sudden infant death syndrome, trauma and drowning among the main etiologies, where hypoxia leads to cardiac arrest. Prompt and effective airway management is therefore paramount when responding to a pediatric OHCA. Any delay in intermediate or advanced airway management has been associated with a decreased chance of survival. The debate about the optimal airway management strategy that should be used in pediatric OHCA is, however, still ongoing.

Generally, emergency medical services (EMS) first use basic airway management techniques i.e., the use of a bag-valve-mask (BVM) device, to restore oxygenation in pediatric OHCA victims. However, these devices present many drawbacks and limitations. First, airtightness must be ensured to enable adequate oxygenation. Second, the use of BVM is associated with gastric air insufflation. This can alter oxygenation by restricting total lung capacity and, consequently, lung compliance. Since decreased lung compliance requires the use of higher pressures to reach the same tidal volume, gastric inflation can indirectly impair venous return. In addition, chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be interrupted to provide ventilations when basic airway management devices are used. However, these interruptions decrease coronary and cerebral blood flow and should be minimized as they have been associated with decreased survival both in animals and humans.

On the other hand, advanced airway management, i.e., tracheal intubation (TI), provides optimal airtightness -thereby avoiding gastric inflation and risk of regurgitation- while allowing the provision of asynchronous ventilations during CPR. However, advanced airway management requires advanced skills that must be maintained through regular practice. Depending on the regional context, skilled prehospital providers may not be immediately available, if at all. This is particularly important when taking care of critically ill children, whom many consider difficult to intubate. The failure rate of TI at first attempt in case of pediatric CPR is high, even in the hospital setting, and associated with unfavorable neurological and survival outcomes. Recently, a registry-based study reported these outcomes to be worse after pediatric OHCA when emergency physicians used TI rather than supraglottic airway (SGA) devices. The interpretation of these results is however limited by the lack of data regarding physician experience and TI attempts.

In line with the above listed limitations of basic or advanced airway management devices, intermediate airway management (IAM) i.e., the use of SGA devices \[18\], could represent a valuable alternative in prehospital settings. One of the best studied SGA devices is the i-gel®, which is both easy and fast to insert, and provides high leak pressures. Its use is associated with a high overall success rate and is easily remembered. Regurgitation and aspiration are not more frequent with IAM devices than with TI and are much less likely than when a BVM device is used. The use of an i-gel® enables continuous chest compressions in most cases, and a higher first rate of successful initial ventilation. This device has been found to increase the chest compression fraction (CCF) and improve ventilations parameters in an adult model of OHCA. In real OHCA, compared to TI, similar outcomes at 30 days and 6 months were found.

There is increasing evidence that IAM devices can safely be used in children. In two pediatric studies of OHCA, American paramedics had significantly higher success rates with SGA devices than with TI. A neonatal animal model showed that the use of SGA was feasible and non-inferior to TI in this population.

Unity Health Toronto,OTHER,NCT02481479,Saxagliptin and Cardiac Structure and Function,SCARF: Saxagliptin on CArdiac StRucture and Function,"Diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of heart failure, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the development of new therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control, recent clinical data from the saxagliptin assessment of vascular outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (SAVOR-TIMI) 53 study observed an unexpected finding of an excess of adjudicated heart failure hospitalizations. This excess occurred in the setting of pre-existing heart failure (HF) hospitalization and in those with elevated biomarkers for heart failure such as N terminal pro Brain type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). A wealth of preclinical data did not suggest a mechanistic basis for an excess of heart failure events, however these preclinical studies primarily focused upon prevention based strategies as opposed to regression studies once established heart failure was present. This proposal seeks to understand if and how dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i,specifically saxagliptin) may influence the development of heart failure, by evaluating changes in cardiac structure and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","The cardiovascular safety and potential cardioprotective effects of diabetes drugs have been the focus of recent research. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all new anti-diabetic drugs to demonstrate no important increase in cardiovascular adverse events before approval.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are oral incretin-based agents that increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level, with proven anti-hyperglycemic effects and are increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes. In a rat model of diabetes and myocardial infarction, sitagliptin treatment improved passive left ventricular compliance, increased endothelial cell density, reduced myocyte hypertrophy and collagen abundance. GLP-1 and DDP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin improve cardiac function, cardiac remodeling, and survival in animal models of pressure-overload and chronic heart failure. However, in another study of post-MI cardiac remodeling in mice, vildagliptin failed to show any early or late protective effects on cardiac function.

Some clinical studies suggest that GLP-1 infusion is associated with an absolute increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure, although data are conflicting. The GLP-1 receptor analog, exenatide may reduce infarct size in patients with myocardial infarction but does not improve LVEF.

The Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Alogliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome EXAMINE trial randomized assigned 5340 patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome to alogliptin or placebo, and found no increase in adverse cardiovascular events in the alogliptin group. In SAVOR-TIMI 53, 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events were randomized to receive saxagliptin or placebo. Over a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P=0.99 for superiority; P\<0.001 for noninferiority). However, patients in the saxagliptin group were more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure, which was not ascertained in the EXAMINE trial. Furthermore, the Sitagliptin Cardiovascular Outcome Study (TECOS), which examined the DPP4i sitagliptin versus placebo in high risk patients for a cardiovascular event demonstrated cardiovascular safety (P\<0.001 for non inferiority), and there was no signal for excess heart failure hospitalizations.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as the ""gold standard"" for measuring LV volume, mass, and ejection fraction. LV volume measurements by cardiac MRI do not rely on geometric assumptions. CMR measurements have excellent intra-observer, inter-observer, and inter-study variability, which were superior to other imaging techniques. The high inter-study reproducibility of CMR affords a substantial reduction in the required sample size to demonstrate even small changes in LV volume, LV mass or LVEF, or conversely, to reliably exclude clinically important changes. Furthermore, CMR tagging allows detailed and quantitative assessment of regional LV diastolic and systolic function. For example, in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), CMR can detect subtle alterations in global and regional LV functions in patients with traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Although prior studies have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects of improved glycemic control on myocardial function, CMR promises to be a more sensitive and accurate technique.

Accordingly, the investigators propose to use CMR to examine the cardiac structure, global and regional function among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with saxagliptin.","Inclusion Criteria:

This study will use MRI scans to evaluate the spinal joints before and after spinal manipulation.","Zygapophysial joints, better known as facet or ""Z"" joints, are located on the back (posterior) of the spine on each side of the vertebrae where it overlaps the neighboring vertebrae. Z joints provide stability and allow the spine to bend and twist. Adhesions in the Z joints may develop following hypomobility of vertebrae. These adhesions may be alleviated by separation (gapping) of the Z joints.

Side posture adjusting (spinal manipulation) is thought by many to gap the Z joints, yet no measurable differences of the Z joints before and after spinal manipulation have ever been published. This study will evaluate gapping of the L3/L4, L4/L5, and L5/S1 Z joints by taking measurements directly from MRI scans of the Z joints before and during positioning for a side posture adjustment, and before and after side posture adjusting.

Health volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) neutral position followed by side posture positioning (trunk rotated to the volunteer's right); 2) neutral position followed by side posture spinal adjusting followed by neutral positioning; 3) neutral position followed by side posture spinal adjusting, followed by side posture positioning; and 4) neutral position followed by neutral position (control group).

This study will use MRI scans to evaluate the spinal joints before and after spinal manipulation. Zygapophysial joints, better known as facet or ""Z"" joints, are located on the back (posterior) of the spine on each side of the vertebrae where it overlaps the neighboring vertebrae. Z joints provide stability and allow the spine to bend and twist. Adhesions in the Z joints may develop following hypomobility of vertebrae. These adhesions may be alleviated by separation (gapping) of the Z joints. Side posture adjusting (spinal manipulation) is thought by many to gap the Z joints, yet no measurable differences of the Z joints before and after spinal manipulation have ever been published. This study will evaluate gapping of the L3/L4, L4/L5, and L5/S1 Z joints by taking measurements directly from MRI scans of the Z joints before and during positioning for a side posture adjustment, and before and after side posture adjusting. Health volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) neutral position followed by side posture positioning (trunk rotated to the volunteer's right); 2) neutral position followed by side posture spinal adjusting followed by neutral positioning; 3) neutral position followed by side posture spinal adjusting, followed by side posture positioning; and 4) neutral position followed by neutral position (control group). MRI scans will be taken with the volunteers in the original neutral position and in the final position (either second neutral position or side posture positioning).

An increasing number of young people will face challenging decisions regarding medical management of this chronic disease during a period of time when they are still completing schooling, establishing their career, and/or are building a family.

Treatment options for IBD consist of immunosuppressive therapy, such as immunomodulators (azathioprine and methotrexate). Methotrexate (MTX) is a folic acid antagonist (a substance that interferes with or inhibits the action of another). It is thought that MTX works by decreasing the inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. MTX has been studied for many years and in used as treatment in not only IBD, but also in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. However, due to concerns about the safety of MTX, particularly in regards to fertility and pregnancy has limited its current use.

Up to 32 male or female patients will participate in this study. The duration of subject participation is approximately 6 weeks.

Patients will receive the oral doses of study drug in the mornings of Days 1, 2, and 3. All patients will receive a single dose of placebo on Day 1, a single dose of JNJ-26489112 on Day 2, and a second single dose of placebo on Day 3. Blood samples will be taken for evaluation of JNJ-26489112 drug concentrations in plasma and blood. Blood samples will also be collected for laboratory safety assessments and measurement of antiepileptic drug concentrations. Further safety will be assessed by the reporting of adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, physical and neurological examinations. Patients will be discharged on the evening of Day 3 after the pharmacokinetic samples have been collected, and after assessment by the investigator, unless there are any ongoing adverse events which require in-house monitoring. EEG tracings, recorded during intermittent photic stimulation sessions, will be digitally recorded on a CD-ROM, coded and evaluated independently by one blinded clinical expert to determine the effects on the photosensitivity range. If complete suppression of photosensitivity or reduction of the photosensitivity range by at least 3 points on the photosensitivity scale in at least one eye condition (during closure, closed, open) is not observed in at least 3 of the 4 patients and a maximum tolerated dose has been reached, the study will be stopped.

University of Utah,OTHER,NCT00734279,Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and the Onset of Puberty,Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and the Onset of Puberty,"The purpose of this study is to determine if the timing of the onset of puberty may be affected by FSH-regulatory peptides.

We will determine how these peptides relate to FSH production in prepubertal and pubertal children by comparing the regulation of FSH control in children with precocious (early) puberty and delayed puberty.

In this pilot study, we will stimulate the pubertal axis using an agonist of GnRH to determine the pubertal response of activin-A, inhibin-A and -B and follistatin.

To determine baseline FSH secretion and FSH-regulatory peptide tone, we will block GnRH with a specific antagonist.

These studies should lead to a better understanding of the role of FSH in controlling the onset of puberty and the pathogenesis of pubertal disorders.","Girls begin puberty earlier and have as much as a 5-fold increase in incidence of precocious puberty as do boys, while boys are more likely to have delayed adolescence compared to girls.

The reasons for sex differences in the timing of puberty and sex-based variation in expression of pubertal disorders are not known.

Puberty is heralded by an increase in the episodic release of luteinizing hormone (LH) under the control of increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. It has been thought that sex differences in central nervous system restraint of GnRH and subsequently of LH secretion account for the differences in timing of onset of puberty in boys and girls.

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is readily detected prior to the onset of puberty and exhibits sexual dimorphism in basal and GnRH-stimulated concentrations. Thus, assessment of factors regulating FSH secretion during childhood may enhance our understanding of sex differences in pubertal development and the pathogenesis of precocious puberty.

Although FSH is secreted under the control of GnRH, FSH is also secreted constitutively under the control of a group of peptides collectively known as the FSH-regulatory proteins. These peptides include activins, peptides that increase FSH secretion and inhibins and follistatins, peptides that suppress FSH secretion.

Gonadal inhibins inhibit FSH via endocrine negative feedback, but their production during puberty is only beginning to be understood. Activin and follistatin have been thought to have a principle paracrine role in FSH regulation but recent data have demonstrated these peptides have an endocrine role as well.

We hypothesize that differences in elaboration of activins, inhibins, and follistatin that alter FSH constitutive secretion underlie precocious and delayed puberty in boys and girls and account, in part, for sex differences in pubertal timing.

Specifically we expect that the inhibitory regulators, inhibins and/or follistatins, will be lower while the stimulatory regulator, activin, will be higher in early compared to delayed puberty.

FSH and the Onset of Puberty is a case control study comparing boys with precocious puberty to boys with delayed adolescence and girls with precocious puberty to girls with delayed adolescence.

Hypothesis: Basal and GnRH agonist-stimulated activin concentrations will be greater and inhibin concentrations lower in children with early puberty than in children with delayed adolescence, and the GnRH antagonist, ganirelix, will decrease activin concentrations in children with early puberty but not in delayed adolescence.

Specific Aim 1: Determine the degree to which FSH-regulatory peptides, compared to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), control FSH secretion in children by suppressing GnRH with ganirelix in children with early and delayed adolescence.

Specific Aim 2: Determine the role of FSH-regulatory peptides in control of timing of onset of puberty by comparing their concentrations with and without GnRH stimulation of FSH in children with precocious puberty and delayed adolescence.

Specific Aim 3: Determine the role of GnRH in control of the FSH-regulatory peptides by comparing activin, inhibin and follistatin concentrations in children with delayed adolescence due to constitutional growth delay to those with delayed adolescence from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism","Inclusion Criteria:

Early Puberty Children who have early puberty may participate in this study. Children must be between 6 and 10 years of age and be healthy with the exception of having early puberty. For early puberty, girls should have had the onset of breast development prior to 8 years of age and boys should have the onset of pubic hair growth or genital growth prior to 9 years of age.

Inclusion Criteria for Delayed Puberty Children who have late (delayed) puberty may participate in this study. Children must be between 12 and 17 years of age and be healthy with the exception of having late puberty. In order to have late puberty, boys and girls should have short stature compared to their family with at least one year delay in bone age as determined by bone age x-ray and/or have the onset of secondary sexual characteristics (breast and pubic hair growth) at 12 years of age or later for a girl or 13 years of age or later for a boy.

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is readily detected prior to the onset of puberty and exhibits sexual dimorphism in basal and GnRH-stimulated concentrations. Thus, assessment of factors regulating FSH secretion during childhood may enhance our understanding of sex differences in pubertal development and the pathogenesis of precocious puberty. Although FSH is secreted under the control of GnRH, FSH is also secreted constitutively under the control of a group of peptides collectively known as the FSH-regulatory proteins. These peptides include activins, peptides that increase FSH secretion and inhibins and follistatins, peptides that suppress FSH secretion. Gonadal inhibins inhibit FSH via endocrine negative feedback, but their production during puberty is only beginning to be understood. Activin and follistatin have been thought to have a principle paracrine role in FSH regulation but recent data have demonstrated these peptides have an endocrine role as well. We hypothesize that differences in elaboration of activins, inhibins, and follistatin that alter FSH constitutive secretion underlie precocious and delayed puberty in boys and girls and account, in part, for sex differences in pubertal timing. Specifically we expect that the inhibitory regulators, inhibins and/or follistatins, will be lower while the stimulatory regulator, activin, will be higher in early compared to delayed puberty. FSH and the Onset of Puberty is a case control study comparing boys with precocious puberty to boys with delayed adolescence and girls with precocious puberty to girls with delayed adolescence. Hypothesis: Basal and GnRH agonist-stimulated activin concentrations will be greater and inhibin concentrations lower in children with early puberty than in children with delayed adolescence, and the GnRH antagonist, ganirelix, will decrease activin concentrations in children with early puberty but not in delayed adolescence. Specific Aim 1: Determine the degree to which FSH-regulatory peptides, compared to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), control FSH secretion in children by suppressing GnRH with ganirelix in children with early and delayed adolescence. Specific Aim 2: Determine the role of FSH-regulatory peptides in control of timing of onset of puberty by comparing their concentrations with and without GnRH stimulation of FSH in children with precocious puberty and delayed adolescence. Specific Aim 3: Determine the role of GnRH in control of the FSH-regulatory peptides by comparing activin, inhibin and follistatin concentrations in children with delayed adolescence due to constitutional growth delay to those with delayed adolescence from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism Inclusion Criteria: Early Puberty Children who have early puberty may participate in this study. Children must be between 6 and 10 years of age and be healthy with the exception of having early puberty. For early puberty, girls should have had the onset of breast development prior to 8 years of age and boys should have the onset of pubic hair growth or genital growth prior to 9 years of age. Inclusion Criteria for Delayed Puberty Children who have late (delayed) puberty may participate in this study. Children must be between 12 and 17 years of age and be healthy with the exception of having late puberty. In order to have late puberty, boys and girls should have short stature compared to their family with at least one year delay in bone age as determined by bone age x-ray and/or have the onset of secondary sexual characteristics (breast and pubic hair growth) at 12 years of age or later for a girl or 13 years of age or later for a boy. Exclusion Criteria: Early Puberty Children with known genetic disorders, chronic medical conditions requiring the use of steroids, and use of medication for puberty within the last 3 months are excluded. Delayed Puberty Children with known genetic disorders with the exception of possible hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, chronic medical conditions requiring the use of steroids, and use of medication for puberty within the last 3 months are excluded. -",OTHER

Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla,OTHER,NCT04011579,Pilates Training in Multiple Sclerosis,Multiple Sclerosis Fitness Intervention Training With Pilates Exercises,"To date, despite recent advances in MS care including rehabilitation interventions, many PwMS are unable to access these developments due to limited mobility, fatigue and related issues, and costs associated with travel.

Thus, physical activity at home could be a new way to deliver exercises to the patients. Although Pilates did not show any significant advantage over standardized physical therapy in the current literature, it is a good method to promote physical activity, sensorimotor integration and cognitive stimulation. Thus, it could be a treatment option to improve fatigue, balance and walking abilities in PwMS; consequently, Pilates could be suggested by the clinician as a physical activity to be integrated in the daily life.

This possibility could be made more feasible using new tools such as those offered by low cost devices.

The main MS-FIT project purposes are to provide and to test a tool based on serious game concept of Pilates-inspired exercises for daily use at home, by mixing the entertainment aspects typical of the videogames and the possibility to perform physical activity.

The MS-FIT tool does not pursue therapeutic aims as rehabilitation does, but it could have a positive impact on prevention and health in MS.

MS-FIT, by using the Microsoft Kinect Motion Controller Xbox or similar to deliver adapted physical activity, offers the possibility to transform the Pilates exercises into a virtual reality game.

MS-FIT, through a multicentre approach, would provide:

* a feasibility study in order to:

  * refine the tool for the final customized version to be used in a RCT MS study
  * assess the tool for PwMS in terms of technology acceptability and satisfaction-to-use
  * assess the process of recruitment, the adherence to the intervention, the dropout rate and identify potential issues
  * assess human resources necessary for the RCT

MS-FIT, through a multicentre approach, would provide:

* Feasibility study
* RCT study

All the 14 participating centres will select a dedicated therapist who will be responsible for patient training in using the MS-FIT tool.

All the subjects recruited following the inclusion/exclusion criteria will sign an informed consent and all the procedures (feasibility and RCT) will be in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and approved by Local Ethical Committee.

No trial-specific procedures will be conducted before informed consent has been obtained, and participants will be reminded that they may withdraw from the trial at any time without it affecting the quality of their care in the future.

Participants with relapses during the period of their involvement in the project will be considered as drop out and will be considered in the analysis for the entire period of study participation.

Feasibility study

Primary objective:

• the refinement of the tool for the final customized version to be used in a RCT MS study. The primary objective will be reached by fixing eventual bugs relieved during the feasibility study and taking into account results from the assessment in terms of technology acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety and the physical effects of the intervention.

Secondary Objectives:

* the estimation of human resources necessary for the RCT.
* the estimation of the effect of the intervention and its variance necessary to calculate the appropriate sample size for the RCT.

Due to the nature of the feasibility study and based on previous literature showing that a sample size of 25-40 subjects per arm is adequate for a feasibility trial, the investigators will recruit 28 PwMS per arm. All the 14 participating centres will recruit a total of 56 recruited patients following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the range of EDSS inclusion criteria 28 subjects will be recruited with lower disability (EDSS 2-3) and 28 with higher disability (EDSS of 3.5 or 4). For both levels the subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITFeas (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLFeas (""unspecific physical activities""). Randomization will be provided by an independent randomization service at FISM accessed via a web-based system, using computer-based block randomization (1 factor: EDSS score 2-3 and 3.5-4). Patient will be allocated to MSFITFeas and CTRLFeas in a 1:1 ratio. Confirmation emails will be sent to Centres PI.

The MSFITFeas group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 6 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 6 weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 6 weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home.

The protocol for the Feasibility study will consist on (Figure 2):

* T0 evaluation (PRE)
* 6 weeks of intervention

  * MSFITFeas: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home
  * CTRLFeas: unspecific physical activities
* T1 evaluation (POST)

The evaluation for the Feasibility study are described in the section Outcome Measures.

Deliverables Deliverables of the Feasibility study will be the final customized tool, a set of indications for the management of the RCT, the sample size estimation for the RCT.

Focus group A nested qualitative study on 14 participants will explore patients' experiences of MS-FIT via Focus Group Meeting (FGM). The objectives are to provide insight into the quantitative results, explore strengths and limitations of the intervention with MS-FIT, so as to guide the RCT.

The report of each FGM analysis will be submitted to FGM participants for review (respondent validation).

Deliverables Deliverables of the nested qualitative study will be the delivery of the report of the FGM analysis.

RCT study

Primary Objective:

• evaluation of the change in TUG.

Secondary Objectives:

* evaluation of the physical effects also in terms of self-reported outcome, upper limb performances, resistance in walking and physical activity, cognitive and psychosocial effects, quality of life and wellbeing. Differences in physical and cognitive performances due to the genetic features will be evaluated also considering subgroups identified through the polymorphism analysis.
* evaluation of the acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety through the measurements of endpoint already listed for the Feasibility study.

The RCT sample size will be definitively calculated based on the results from the feasibility study. However, by considering the literature about Pilates in MS, the investigators can preliminary estimate the needed sample size. In particular, the investigators refer to the TUG post-intervention improvement found by Karlon et al. in a group of PwMS performing Pilates. For our aim, the investigators can consider this result even if no differences between Pilates group and control group (Physiotherapy) were found. Pilates group improved the performance in TUG of about 1.8s, that could be considered as clinically relevant for PwMS. By considering a variability of about 3.4s, a power of 80%, a level of significance (two sided) of 5% and a potential loss of 15% of patients at follow-up, the estimation of the necessary sample size consists of approximately 63 subjects for the experimental group (a total of 126).

All the 14 participating centres will be involved in the patients' enrolment. The subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITRCT (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLRCT (""unspecific physical activities""). The randomization will be carried out using a web based procedure and will be centrally managed. A stratified minimization/adaptive algorithm will be used in order to balance the baseline EDSS (2-3 vs 3.5-4) factors across the two groups.

The MSFITRCT group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 12 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. The follow-up (FU) evaluation will be after 6 weeks since the end of the intervention. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home.

At the end of the 18 weeks, the participants of the CTRLRCT group will be offered the MS-FIT intervention.

The requirement that the enrolled patients will have not to perform any supervised physical activity or rehabilitative intervention is in line with recent studies showing that most of PwMS with mild disability (78.34% EDSS \<4) were not treated with rehabilitation.

The subjects involved in the feasibility study will be excluded from the RCT study in order to avoid bias effects.

The protocol design for the RCT study will consist on (Figure 3):

* T0 evaluation (PRE)
* 12 weeks of intervention

  * MSFITRCT: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home
  * CTRLRCT: unspecific physical activities
* T1 evaluation (POST)
* T2 evaluation (FU) - after 6 weeks from T1

The evaluation for the RCT study are described in the section Outcome Measures. Moreover, blood samples will be collected at T0 to investigate if genetic polymorphisms of candidate regulators of neuronal plasticity could be correlated to the response to the proposed protocol. According to previous report MS subjects of the two RCT groups could be subdivided in subgroups with respect to the polymorphism features. For example, for the CNR1 gene the subdivision could be based on the number of AAT repetitions (short AAT: homozygous or heterozygous for allele with ≤11 repeats of AAT triplets; long AAT: homozygous for allele with ≥12 repeats of AAT triplets).

Differences among subgroups in terms of physical and cognitive performances will be evaluated.

In particular, all patients will be genotyped for a total of 55 genetic polymorphisms of 23 potential regulators, like: Homer1; AKT1; RAPTOR; D2R; GAPD; CHAT; p53; BRCA2; LIG4; XRCC5; CYP3A4; NBS1; MDM2; CNR1, ATTn; CNR2; GRIN1; GRIN2B; TRPV1; FAAH, COMPT; (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) BDNF.

Blood sample will be assessed from participants early in the morning after awakening (8h). To synchronize the sample for lifestyle variables, subjects were requested to avoid excessive physical activity the last three days before the blood sampling, sleep for 7-8h the night before study, avoid starving, and eat a usual breakfast in the morning (approximately 1h before the time of the breakfast).

The samples will be collected by each participant centre and shipped to the IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia (Prof. Diego Centonze) for the analyses.

Deliverables Deliverables will be the report of the results of the trial and the final guidelines to make available and easy-to-use the MS-FIT tool

By considering a variability of about 3.4s, a power of 80%, a level of significance (two sided) of 5% and a potential loss of 15% of patients at follow-up, the estimation of the necessary sample size consists of approximately 63 subjects for the experimental group (a total of 126). All the 14 participating centres will be involved in the patients' enrolment. The subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITRCT (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLRCT (""unspecific physical activities""). The randomization will be carried out using a web based procedure and will be centrally managed. A stratified minimization/adaptive algorithm will be used in order to balance the baseline EDSS (2-3 vs 3.5-4) factors across the two groups. The MSFITRCT group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 12 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. The follow-up (FU) evaluation will be after 6 weeks since the end of the intervention. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home. At the end of the 18 weeks, the participants of the CTRLRCT group will be offered the MS-FIT intervention. The requirement that the enrolled patients will have not to perform any supervised physical activity or rehabilitative intervention is in line with recent studies showing that most of PwMS with mild disability (78.34% EDSS \<4) were not treated with rehabilitation. The subjects involved in the feasibility study will be excluded from the RCT study in order to avoid bias effects. The protocol design for the RCT study will consist on (Figure 3): * T0 evaluation (PRE) * 12 weeks of intervention * MSFITRCT: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home * CTRLRCT: unspecific physical activities * T1 evaluation (POST) * T2 evaluation (FU) - after 6 weeks from T1 The evaluation for the RCT study are described in the section Outcome Measures. Moreover, blood samples will be collected at T0 to investigate if genetic polymorphisms of candidate regulators of neuronal plasticity could be correlated to the response to the proposed protocol. According to previous report MS subjects of the two RCT groups could be subdivided in subgroups with respect to the polymorphism features. For example, for the CNR1 gene the subdivision could be based on the number of AAT repetitions (short AAT: homozygous or heterozygous for allele with ≤11 repeats of AAT triplets; long AAT: homozygous for allele with ≥12 repeats of AAT triplets). Differences among subgroups in terms of physical and cognitive performances will be evaluated. In particular, all patients will be genotyped for a total of 55 genetic polymorphisms of 23 potential regulators, like: Homer1; AKT1; RAPTOR; D2R; GAPD; CHAT; p53; BRCA2; LIG4; XRCC5; CYP3A4; NBS1; MDM2; CNR1, ATTn; CNR2; GRIN1; GRIN2B; TRPV1; FAAH, COMPT; (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) BDNF. Blood sample will be assessed from participants early in the morning after awakening (8h). To synchronize the sample for lifestyle variables, subjects were requested to avoid excessive physical activity the last three days before the blood sampling, sleep for 7-8h the night before study, avoid starving, and eat a usual breakfast in the morning (approximately 1h before the time of the breakfast). The samples will be collected by each participant centre and shipped to the IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia (Prof. Diego Centonze) for the analyses. Deliverables Deliverables will be the report of the results of the trial and the final guidelines to make available and easy-to-use the MS-FIT tool Criteria for Premature Withdrawal Criteria for the premature withdrawal are: 1.

1. Primary objectives:

   * To evaluate the adverse events, adverse reactions, severe adverse events and severe adverse reactions during the study period, so as to investigate the safety;
   * To evaluate the changes of serum ferritin over time after orally administration of CN128 in thalassaemia patients with blood transfusion dependent and aged 16 and above, so as to investigate the efficacy;
   * To evaluate the effect on iron excretion in liver after orally administration of CN128 for 12, 24 weeks in thalassaemia patients with blood transfusion dependent and aged 16 and above, so as to investigate the efficacy;
   * To evaluate the effect on iron excretion in heart after orally administration of CN128 for 12, 24 weeks in thalassaemia patients with blood transfusion dependent and aged 16 and above, so as to investigate the efficacy;
   * To evaluate the proportion of patients with decreased or unchanged liver iron content after orally administration of CN128 for 12, 24 weeks in thalassaemia patients with blood transfusion dependent and aged 16 and above, so as to investigate the efficacy;
   * To evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term orally administration of CN128 in thalassaemia patients with blood transfusion dependent and aged 16 and above.
2. Design:

   * The study is designed as a single arm and opened phase IIa clinical trial, so as to investigate the safety and efficacy of CN128.
   * A total of 50 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled, and orally administration of CN128 for 24 weeks or 48 weeks according to the administration plan. The treatment period is from day 0 to 24 weeks, and the extended treatment period was from 25 weeks to 96 weeks.
   * Administration plan:

   (1)0 day\~48 weeks： The trial will start with the lower dose of CN128 (10 mg/kg body weight \[bw\], bid) for two weeks, then the subjects will return to the study center. If no unacceptable toxicity associated with CN128 is found, the subjects will be given the higher dose (15 mg/kg body weight \[bw\], bid). If unacceptable toxicity associated with CN128 is found, the subjects will be suspended or stopped administration. If the adverse event turns to normal or abnormal but no clinical significance after suspension administration, the subjects will be given the lower dose of CN128 (10 mg/kg body weight \[bw\], bid).

   After taking CN128 at 15 mg/kg, if unacceptable toxicity associated with CN128 is found, the dosage will be reduce to 10 mg/kg. If no symptoms appear, the dose can be increased to 15 mg/kg. If the unacceptable toxicity related to CN128 still occurs, the subjects will be suspended or stopped administration. If the adverse event turns to normal or abnormal but no clinical significance after suspension administration, the subjects will be given the lower dose of CN128 (10 mg/kg body weight \[bw\], bid). The dose will be assessed once every two or four weeks.

   Subjects' medication status, uncomfortable symptoms, concomitant medication or non-drug therapy were recorded daily.

   (2)49 weeks\~96 weeks： Subjects who have completed 48 weeks of treatment may continue dosing at the original dose until the end of the study or withdraw early if they do not experience intolerable toxicity associated with CN128 tablets and have fair efficacy (≥20% elevation on MRI T2\*) and if, in the judgment of the investigator, the benefits outweigh the risks.

   Subjects who have completed 48 weeks of treatment, who have not experienced intolerable toxicity associated with CN128 tablets, but who have been assessed by the investigator as having poor efficacy (\<20% elevation of MRI T2\*) and in the judgment of the investigator the benefit outweighs the risk, may, with the subject's consent, have the dosage increased at the additional visit or the established most recent visit to 15 mg/kg in the morning and 20 mg/kg in the evening, with an assessment made at 2 weeks of dosing：

   If no relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the dose may continue to be increased to 20 mg/kg bid and assessed after 2 weeks of dosing:
   1. If no relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the 20 mg/kg bid dose may be administered until the end of the study or early withdrawal (daily dose 40 mg/kg/d);
   2. If relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the dose may be reduced to 15 mg/kg in the morning and 20 mg/kg bid in the evening until the end of the study or early withdrawal (daily dose 35 mg/kg/d).

   If relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the dose may be reduced to 15 mg/kg bid until the end of the study or early withdrawal (daily dose 30 mg/kg/d).

In the diabetic neuropathic foot, it commonly manifests as loss of protective sensation, foot deformity and skin dryness.

Studies have proven that callus formation leads to high plantar pressure and increased risk of diabetic foot ulcers. For podiatrists, diabetic foot screening and treatment is our daily practice.

University of Miami,OTHER,NCT02658084,Vinorelbine With Trastuzumab Emtansine in Pre-Treated HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer,A Phase I/II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Vinorelbine With Trastuzumab Emtansine in Pre-Treated HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer,The study proposes to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and vinorelbine in HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients.,"This is a Phase I/II, single arm, open-label clinical trial designed to establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of vinorelbine with a fixed dose of trastuzumab emtansine. The study will also evaluate the safety and efficacy of the RP2D in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic, locally advanced, or unresectable breast cancer. The study will be opened to accrual at the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) main campus and constituent satellite sites, Deerfield Beach and Plantation.

This phase I/II study will have a total of 50 enrolled patients, taking into account 10% drop-out in the phase II follow-up. The duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects in Phase I/II is 2 years. The estimated duration for the Investigators to complete this study (Phase I/II) is 4.5 to 5 years.

For the phase I portion, standard 3+3 dose escalation/de-escalation design will be applied. Approximately 15 to 21 patients will be needed to establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). For the phase II portion of the study, up to 35 patients will be treated at the RP2D (MTD) including 6 patients treated at RP2D in phase I. Patients may remain on treatment with the combination until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity.

Tumor assessments will be conducted every 6 weeks (±7 days) to week 18. Thereafter, these assessments will be done every 12 weeks (±7 days). These will shall occur regardless of dose delays or dose interruptions, until Investigator-assessed progressive disease (PD), or death, whichever occurs first. More frequent tumor assessments may be performed as clinically indicated, at the discretion of the treating Investigator.

For the phase II portion of the study - patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than PD will continue to have required tumor assessments completed until PD or the initiation of a new therapy. Once patients have progressed, they will be followed for survival approximately every 3 months for at least 3 years. Subsequent anti-cancer therapies will be documented until study completion.

Patients who are discontinued from study treatment will return for the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit approximately 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study treatment.","Inclusion Criteria:

CONKO-Studiengruppe,OTHER,NCT01945879,Pilot Safety Trial of Chemotherapy and Use of Heparin in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer,Pilot Study of Intensified Chemotherapy and Simultaneous Treatment With Heparin in Out-patients With Pancreatic Cancer.,"Venous thromboembolic events are considered to be a prognostic negative factor and small studies showed astonishing survival advantages using heparin as prophylactic treatment to prevent venous thromboembolic events. Based on these assumptions our Charité - Onkologie (CONKO) study group planned to conduct a randomized trial to investigate the impact of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in a prospective setting in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing first line therapy, the CONKO-004 trial. During the preliminary stages we had to undertake a pilot trial to get information on safety and feasibility of combined chemotherapy with simultaneous treatment of the LMWH Enoxaparin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who are at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to local cancer spread.","The trial was a prospective, open-label, single center investigation in patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer who were treated with first-line chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. The intensified treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1g/m² (30 min), 5-flourouracil 750 mg/m² (24 h), folinic acid 200 mg/m² (30 min), and Cisplatin 30 mg/m² (90 min) on day 1 and 8; q3w). Beyond initial 3 months of intensified chemotherapy all patients without cancer progression received further treatment with gemcitabine alone to prevent patients from cumulative toxicities. The concomitant use of Enoxaparin started on day 1 of chemotherapy with a fixed dose of 40 mg daily until cancer progression. Dose adjustment for enoxaparin was recommended in patients with impaired kidney function or thrombocytopenia within the study according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria guidelines to minimize bleeding risk. Prophylactic antiemetic therapy and supportive care were provided according to individual symptoms and demand.

The study used a sequential design to be able to stop the feasibility investigation in case of severe side effects. After inclusion of three consecutive patients a hold of recruitment was arranged until all three patients received at least 4 weeks of concomitant enoxaparin treatment. In absence of serious events the recruitment should be continued until a minimum of 15 patients received at least 12 weeks concomitant enoxaparin treatment.

The trial was approved by the Scientific and Research Ethics Committee of our institution. The investigation was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

Study period: September 2018- September 2019

Hypothesis: When a high risk patient, Apfel-score 3 or 4, is given Apfel-score based PONV care with strict adherence to PONV guidelines there should be no difference in Quality of Recovery between a high-risk patient and a low-risk patient.

Aim: The aim of the study is to investigate if it is possible to reach no difference in Quality of Recovery (QoR) between a high-risk patient and a low risk patient using Apfel-score based PONV care.

Primary objective: Assessing Quality of Recovery, using QoR15 at 24h, 48h, 72h and after 7 days.

Secondary objectives: Assessing the incidence and severity of PONV and PDNV in females undergoing laparoscopic surgery up to 72h. Assessing PONV and PDNV severity and duration. Nicotine habits and impact on PONV.

Study outline: Females scheduled for elective abdominal laparoscopic surgery will be provided PONV care based on Apfel risk-score. All patients will fill in the QoR15 form before surgery (base line). PONV and PDNV will be assessed in the PACU postoperatively, after 24h, 48h and 72h. Quality of Recovery will be assessed up to 7 days after surgery.

Treatment: The females will be given ordinary care after local routines, with strict adherence to PONV guidelines.

Study population: 100 females aged 18-65, ASA 1-2, undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery in Danderyds Hospital.

Primary outcome variables and examinations: When the QoR 15 reaches base line or better after surgery. Number of times the females experience nausea, retching or vomiting and the impact of emetic symptoms on the QoR.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Société Française d'Anesthésie et de Réanimation,OTHER,NCT05575284,Pain Intensity After RObotic Assisted Urological Surgery,Pain Intensity After RObotic Assisted Urological Surgery: the PAIROU Study,"Postoperative pain remains a widespread but still underestimated problem. Studies have shown that despite improvements in pain management, many patients still suffer from moderate to severe postoperative pain. Severe pain is associated with decreased patient satisfaction, delayed postoperative ambulation, prolonged length of stay, risk of developing chronic postoperative pain, and increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is of great importance that surgical procedures that result in severe pain and the optimal analgesic strategies for these procedures can be identified. Most recommendations on postoperative pain management (prevention and treatment) are not procedure-specific. However, risk factors for postoperative pain depend on the patient and the procedure.

In order to develop procedure-specific postoperative pain management guidelines, pain must be assessed in a procedure-specific manner. Additionally, data is sparse on relatively new procedures like robotic surgery. A study, Harel et al. compared pain intensities after ureteral reimplantation with robotic or open surgery in children and reported lower pain scores after robotic surgery. This single study reinforces the clinical findings that robotic surgery is associated with less pain. However, pain assessment after robotic urologic surgery has not been evaluated before.

In order to add to the evaluation of postoperative pain in different surgical groups, we wish to evaluate pain intensities after robot-assisted urological surgery.

This project will comprise the first three project phases according to the Module Development Manual (www.eortc.be/qol).","The project follows the EORTC model of module development and covers the first three phases:

Phase I This phase is aimed at compiling an extensive list of quality of life issues relevant for lung cancer patients. The following sources will be used: (1) existing questionnaires on lung cancer and respiratory illnesses, (2) the literature, (3) investigator's brochures (IB) on new drugs, and (4) interviews with health care professionals and patients.

Phase II Phase I data will provide information about the issues that should be included in an improved lung cancer module. These issues are being converted into items that follow the EORTC format with four point response scales ranging from ""not at all"" to ""very much"". For the sake of consistency and whenever possible, items of the existing QLC-LC13 will be used or other items will be taken from the Item Bank that currently includes more than 6.000 items. After this stage, the procedure will be formally peer-reviewed by the EORTC QLG Module Development Committee. After approval, the provisional list of items is ready for Phase III.

Phase III The provisional lung cancer module will be pre-tested in an international group of patients with lung cancer. Patients will be first asked to fill in the QLQ-C30 and the provisional revised lung cancer module. After completing the forms, patients will be interviewed with regard to the revised lung cancer module. The interview will identify questionnaire items that patients find annoying, confusing or upsetting. A further issue is relevance: patients should indicate whether there are issues they find irrelevant or whether issues not yet included in the provisional module need to be added. The interviewer, either a physician or a study nurse, will record patients' comments on the debriefing questionnaire.

Zagazig University,OTHER_GOV,NCT04874779,Acute Kidney Injury Risk in COVID-19,Risk of Acute Kidney Injury Among Patients Infected With COVID-19: A Retrospective Single Center Study,"Background. Within a year, COVID-19 has advanced from being an outbreak to a pandemic, spreading rapidly and globally with devastating impact. Currently, there is an ongoing debate among scientists about the pathophysiological relationship between COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI). While a few studies have concluded that the mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19 patients are seemingly multifactorial and have not been fully explicated, others asserted that AKI remains rare among COVID-19-related diseases. Considering this knowledge-gap and its potential impact on the management of COVID-19-associated AKI, our study aims to explore the prevalence of AKI and to identify possible risk factors associated with AKI development among COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Materials and Methods. This retrospective cohort study included 83 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at AL-AHRAR Hospital, Zagazig, Egypt, between June and August,2020. Exclusion criteria were: patients younger than 18 years of age; diagnosed with end stage kidney disease; placed on maintenance dialysis; booked for a kidney transplant or on nephrotoxic medications. All patients included in the study underwent complete blood count; liver and renal function tests; examination of hemostasis parameters; inflammatory markers; serum electrolytes; routine urinalysis; arterial blood gas and non-enhanced chest and abdominal computer tomography (CT) scans","2.1. Study design and participants. Retrospective observational single-center study, including (83) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (age ≥ 18 years), hospitalized and isolated in the medical departments of AL-AHRAR Hospital, Zagazig, Egypt, from June 23 to August 29, 2020. All patients were isolated in the medical departments. None of them were admitted to the ICU or underwent mechanical ventilation. According to the WHO guidelines, a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result of a quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection in a nasopharyngeal swab. (9) We excluded the following from this study: patients younger than 18 years, patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease before admission, patients on maintenance dialysis or awaiting renal transplantation and patients taking any nephrotoxic medications a week prior to admission.

2.2. Data collection. The patients' medical history, underlying diseases, medications administered at home and in hospital, laboratory data, non-enhanced chest and abdominal computer tomography (CT) scans, were retrieved from electronic medical records. According to the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), Egypt Management protocol for COVID-19 Patients, version 1.4, 30th May,2020, (10), all patients received standard of care treatment including: (a) oxygen supply to achieve SaO2 ≥ 90%; (b) Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice in first day then 200 mg twice for 6 days); (C) Vitamin C (1gm daily); (d) Zinc (50mg daily); (e) Acetylcysteine 200 mg t.d.s.; (f) lactoferrin one sachet twice daily; (g) Anticoagulation if D-dimer \> 1000.

2.3. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using Thermofisher SCIENTIFIC's TaqPathTM COVID 19 CE IVD RT PCR Kit, 1000 reactions (Cat. No. A48067). The QUIAGEN extraction kit was used to extract viral RNA. Using Quick Dx Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR instruments, the purified nucleic acid was reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified using the TaqPathTM COVID 19 RT PCR Kit in one stage. Probes annealed to three unique SARS-CoV-2 target sequences: ORF1ab, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) primers/probes for bacteriophage MS2. The result was deemed null because two of the three genes and the MS2 (positive control) were all positive. COVID-19 was diagnosed whenever a positive real-time RT-PCR result was identified.

2.4. Laboratory procedures. Laboratory data included complete blood count by automated blood counter, liver and renal function tests by colorimetric method, examination of hemostasis parameters, inflammatory markers, serum Na, Serum K, serum Ca, urine dipstick test and arterial blood gas analysis.

2.5. Definitions. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to the guidelines of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). It is defined as any of the following: (I) an S.cr increase ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 h; or (II) an S.cr increase to ≥1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days; or (III) a urine volume ≤0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 h. AKI is staged for severity according to the criteria presented in Table (1). (11) Urine output criteria were not used consistently for the diagnosis of AKI due to a lack of daily urine measurement in the electronic chart.

The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was developed as a morbidity severity score to focus on organ dysfunction, which can reliably predict disease severity and outcome. It includes 6 variables, each representing an organ system presented in Table (2). (12) Statistical Analyses. The SPSS software, version 26, was used for statistical analysis. ANOVA and univariate logistic regression analysis \[odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)\] were performed (significance level: P \< 0.05).

Ethics statement. In order to maintain and ascertain the rights of patients without jeopardizing their privacy and confidentiality, informed verbal consents, in lieu of written informed consents, were obtained directly from all patients or their relatives. The requirements to obtain written informed consents were not attainable due to the inherent hazardous and contagious nature of COVID-19 epidemic, the strict restrictions by the hospital management, and the urgency of collecting the data.","Inclusion Criteria:

According to the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), Egypt Management protocol for COVID-19 Patients, version 1.4, 30th May,2020, (10), all patients received standard of care treatment including: (a) oxygen supply to achieve SaO2 ≥ 90%; (b) Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice in first day then 200 mg twice for 6 days); (C) Vitamin C (1gm daily); (d) Zinc (50mg daily); (e) Acetylcysteine 200 mg t.d.s.; (f) lactoferrin one sachet twice daily; (g) Anticoagulation if D-dimer \> 1000. 2.3. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using Thermofisher SCIENTIFIC's TaqPathTM COVID 19 CE IVD RT PCR Kit, 1000 reactions (Cat. No. A48067). The QUIAGEN extraction kit was used to extract viral RNA. Using Quick Dx Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR instruments, the purified nucleic acid was reverse transcribed into cDNA and amplified using the TaqPathTM COVID 19 RT PCR Kit in one stage. Probes annealed to three unique SARS-CoV-2 target sequences: ORF1ab, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) primers/probes for bacteriophage MS2. The result was deemed null because two of the three genes and the MS2 (positive control) were all positive. COVID-19 was diagnosed whenever a positive real-time RT-PCR result was identified. 2.4. Laboratory procedures. Laboratory data included complete blood count by automated blood counter, liver and renal function tests by colorimetric method, examination of hemostasis parameters, inflammatory markers, serum Na, Serum K, serum Ca, urine dipstick test and arterial blood gas analysis. 2.5. Definitions. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to the guidelines of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). It is defined as any of the following: (I) an S.cr increase ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 h; or (II) an S.cr increase to ≥1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days; or (III) a urine volume ≤0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 h. AKI is staged for severity according to the criteria presented in Table (1). (11) Urine output criteria were not used consistently for the diagnosis of AKI due to a lack of daily urine measurement in the electronic chart. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was developed as a morbidity severity score to focus on organ dysfunction, which can reliably predict disease severity and outcome. It includes 6 variables, each representing an organ system presented in Table (2). (12) Statistical Analyses. The SPSS software, version 26, was used for statistical analysis. ANOVA and univariate logistic regression analysis \[odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)\] were performed (significance level: P \< 0.05). Ethics statement. In order to maintain and ascertain the rights of patients without jeopardizing their privacy and confidentiality, informed verbal consents, in lieu of written informed consents, were obtained directly from all patients or their relatives. The requirements to obtain written informed consents were not attainable due to the inherent hazardous and contagious nature of COVID-19 epidemic, the strict restrictions by the hospital management, and the urgency of collecting the data. Inclusion Criteria: According to the WHO guidelines, a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result of a quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection in a nasopharyngeal swab. Exclusion Criteria: patients younger than 18 years, patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease before admission, patients on maintenance dialysis or awaiting renal transplantation and patients taking any nephrotoxic medications a week prior to admission",OTHER_GOV

Emory University,OTHER,NCT02122679,Tranexamic Acid Effect on Platelet Aggregation Following Infant Cardiopulmonary Bypass,A Randomized Trial Investigating the Effect of Tranexamic Acid on Platelet Aggregation Following Infant Cardiopulmonary Bypass,"Tranexamic acid is a relatively safe medicine that is used to help the body develop clots and slow down bleeding after large surgeries. While it has already been shown to work well in adults and older children, there is no information on whether it works, and how it works in children younger than 6 months old. The goal of our study is to try and understand whether and how tranexamic acid works in children younger than 6 months old who are having open heart surgery.

We plan to study tranexamic acid by testing its effect when compared with a placebo. The investigators will use a method called randomization - which means patients who agree to be in the study will be entered into a computer. The computer will randomly assign them to either receive the medicine or the placebo. We will then compare effects on the 2 groups of patients. Our goal is to have 50 patients in each group, or 100 patients total. We will not know whether patients receive tranexamic acid or placebo until we review the data collected at the end of the study.

Tranexamic acid is usually given to patients in the operating room during open heart surgery. During open heart surgery patients require cardio-pulmonary bypass which is a machine that replaces the function of the heart and lungs for a short period of time. This allows surgeons to do surgery on the heart itself without having to worry about it moving during the operation. The bypass machine has lots of tubes to carry the blood around it. When blood comes into contact with the tubing it has a tendency to clot. To prevent this patients are given a blood thinner called heparin. Although heparin prevents clotting in the bypass machine, it can also increase the risk of bleeding when the surgery is over. To reduce this risk patients are given another medicine at the completion of surgery called protamine to try and reverse the effect of the blood thinner, heparin.

Even so bleeding remains a significant problem, especially for babies after open heart surgery. Being on the bypass machine and having a lot of suture (stitches) lines increase that risk. In addition, the bypass machine affects the function of platelets, the main component of the body's clotting system. We often have to replenish blood products after surgery to try and stop the bleeding. Some centers, including we , have used the medicine tranexamic acid to try and help with bleeding after surgery. There have been other studies that show it helps with fibrinolysis, which is another important part of the body's clotting system. However, that part of the clotting system is not well developed in infants and therefore likely does not play an important role in preventing bleeding in that age group.

As such, it may be that tranexamic acid impacts platelet function as well, and it is that effect that helps decrease post-operative bleeding in infants younger than 6 months. This has not been previously studied. In order to study the effect that tranexamic acid has on platelets the investigators are proposing the investigators' research trial. The investigators plan to randomize patients to either receive tranexamic acid or placebo in the operating room as described above. The investigators will then draw a small amount of blood from each patient (total of approximately 1 tablespoon) and send it to a special lab for testing of platelet function. The lab test will help us understand whether the platelets function better when patients receive tranexamic acid instead of placebo.

The investigators will also be monitoring other outcomes related to platelet function. These will include how much bleeding patients have after surgery when they are in the intensive care unit, and how much blood products they require to treat that bleeding. The investigators will also monitor labs that are checked routinely in all patients after open heart surgery. The investigators will also track how long it takes each patient to get off the ventilator and how long they spend in the ICU after surgery. All of this data will help us understand whether tranexamic acid makes a positive impact on outcomes after open heart surgery in infants less than 6 months old.

The current standard of care is quite variable within our institution as well as at other institutions. Some anesthesiologists use tranexamic acid while others elect not to. There is no definitive guideline to its current use. The dosing differs from center to center, and there are some centers that do not use it at all.

The investigators' hope is that the results of this study will help us understand the role tranexamic acid plays in preserving the function of platelets after open heart surgery in young infants, and whether that impact translates into improved outcomes for those patients. Based on the results of our research we hope to develop definitive guidelines for the use of tranexamic acid in the population of infants \<6 months old undergoing open heart surgery.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

A Mixed-methods Feasibility Study.,"A variety of biomechanical gait modification interventions can elevate knee loading and improve knee symptoms in knee osteoarthritis patients. However, there was a lack of acceptability and adherence regarding modification interventions without any explanation.

Thus, this study investigates the feasibility and acceptability of foot insoles as a gait modification tool among Saudi Arabian knee osteoarthritis patients and physiotherapists.

This study aims to answer the following:

* Which gait modification intervention is most likely to be implemented in Saudi Arabia (SA) clinical practice, taking context, patients' clinical and research evidence into consideration?
* In Saudi Arabia, can this proposed foot-insole intervention be implemented? Is there sufficient experience among physiotherapists regarding gait modification to deliver it, and will patients engage with it? How can KOA rehabilitation outcomes be evaluated in the future?

The participants will be conducted over three phases:

1. The patients' interview and therapists' focus group discussion will be used to examine KOA patients' and clinicians' perspectives on enabling and accepting gait modifications in phase 1.
2. The feasibility study will explore how a small number of KOA patients tolerate gait modifications and consider the most relevant outcome measures, such as pain and function, in phase (2).
3. A small group of knee osteoarthritis patients and their physiotherapists who participated in phase (2) will be asked to participate in a descriptive survey in phase (3). To examine the acceptability and feasibility of the study intervention in phase (2).","Since several different types of gait modifications have been studied, it has been challenging to determine which are most likely to be used by patients and healthcare professionals.

A notable number of Saudi Arabians suffer from knee osteoarthritis (KOA), which reported a 29.5% prevalence of KOA; another recent study reported a 24.5% prevalence of KOA among the elderly. A 2002 study found that 30.8% of those aged 46-55 and 60.6% aged 66-75 were affected. Thus, KOA is roughly equally distributed between genders and is more prevalent among elderly and overweight individuals, so policymakers should focus on raising awareness to prevent and treat affected individuals. The healthcare system in SA is publicly funded and accessible; 79% of patients use the public system, and the rest obtain private care. In most cases, private patients have insurance coverage.

This snapshot of the literary review raises questions about the viability of the long-term use of learned/assistive gait modifications. The studies reported dissatisfaction with the gait modification approach but gave no reasons. Since most studies focus on results in a short time or a specific area, pre-training courses measuring acceptability and commitment can fill the gaps in previous studies.

This device, called the FQS system, is a type of cold, or non-heat producing laser and tranquil music system that will emit light and music onto the ear surface, through commonly found music earphones, available in most electronic stores. The theory behind this treatment technique is that the light and music will stimulate the part of the brain responsible for producing chemicals that satisfy the desire for nicotine. If this is correct, then the user will replace the need for nicotine with the pleasant treatment experience of light and music therapy.","This study aims to define the safety and physiologic effects that occur when low level light and music, configured in a wearable binaural head set are employed by seasoned smokers of cigarettes, with the end result of reducing the desire to smoke. This device use does not require any complementary or adjunctive drug use. A review of unregulated products that are marketed for smoking cessation, have as common mechanism of action, the administration and withdrawal of nicotine in a controlled dosing format. The proposed study device does not consider the use of the culprit drug, the best pathway to achieve rapid and long-lasting cessation results. The theoretical principle at work is the competition for absorption by nicotinic cholinergic receptors located in the brain by nicotine or by the LLLT and music therapy. If this competition for absorption by two competing elements (cigarettes and the proposed device) can result in the device ""winning the race"", then the neurotransmitters will respond to the LLLT and music stimulus instead of the serum nicotine and yield a reduced desire to consume nicotine. As with any new technology, it is essential to learn the variance between true efficacy and the placebo level of efficacy. This study seeks to define that variance.","Inclusion Criteria:

This device, called the FQS system, is a type of cold, or non-heat producing laser and tranquil music system that will emit light and music onto the ear surface, through commonly found music earphones, available in most electronic stores. The theory behind this treatment technique is that the light and music will stimulate the part of the brain responsible for producing chemicals that satisfy the desire for nicotine. If this is correct, then the user will replace the need for nicotine with the pleasant treatment experience of light and music therapy. This study aims to define the safety and physiologic effects that occur when low level light and music, configured in a wearable binaural head set are employed by seasoned smokers of cigarettes, with the end result of reducing the desire to smoke. This device use does not require any complementary or adjunctive drug use. A review of unregulated products that are marketed for smoking cessation, have as common mechanism of action, the administration and withdrawal of nicotine in a controlled dosing format. The proposed study device does not consider the use of the culprit drug, the best pathway to achieve rapid and long-lasting cessation results. The theoretical principle at work is the competition for absorption by nicotinic cholinergic receptors located in the brain by nicotine or by the LLLT and music therapy. If this competition for absorption by two competing elements (cigarettes and the proposed device) can result in the device ""winning the race"", then the neurotransmitters will respond to the LLLT and music stimulus instead of the serum nicotine and yield a reduced desire to consume nicotine. As with any new technology, it is essential to learn the variance between true efficacy and the placebo level of efficacy. This study seeks to define that variance.

Stanford University,OTHER,NCT00285779,Use of Etanercept in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Lichen Planus,"A Double-Blind, Randomized, Multicenter Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Etanercept 50mg SC Twice Weekly in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Lichen Planus","The purpose is to assess the response of subjects to etanercept (as compared to placebo) in treating the physical signs of mucosal and cutaneous lichen planus. The investigators also wish to assess the effect of etanercept on disease-related itching, pain, and serious adverse events in patients with lichen planus.","Lichen planus affects up to 1% of the worldwide population. Recent estimates suggest approximately 0.44% of the US population suffers from this disease. Oral or genital involvement occurs in 60-70% of patients, and it may be the sole manifestation of disease in 20-30% of patients.

Lichen planus is a mucocutaneous disorder that can involve the skin, oral or genital mucosa, conjunctiva, and nails. On the skin, the disease presents as multiple papules, which can be localized or generalized, that are often extremely itchy. Mucosal disease can consist of either asymptomatic plaques or extremely painful erosive lesions. The disease course is unpredictable and typically lasts 1-2 years but can follow a chronic, relapsing course. Erosive mucosal disease is important to aggressively treat for many reasons: First, the associated pain can be debilitating for the patient. Patients with severe oral lichen planus can become malnourished due to pain associated with eating. Vulvar disease can cause dyspareunia, burning pain, and discharge; second, the disease tends to be chronic, with little chance for self-resolution; third, erosive disease is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in the affected areas. These cancers occur in up to 1% of patients over a 3-year period, and they can be aggressive and even-life threatening for the patient if not recognized and treated early.

Several lines of evidence suggest that TNF-alpha plays a role in the pathogenesis of lichen planus. It has been shown that there are increased levels of TNF-alpha in the serum of these patients. In addition, skin and mucosal biopsies show increased TNF-alpha produced by the infiltrating lymphocytes as well as the basal keratinocytes. It has been suggested that the expression of TNF-alpha receptor on the basal keratinocytes may contribute to apoptosis. Also, TNFR1 (a TNF-alpha receptor) is expressed by the infiltrating mononuclear cells as well as the keratinocytes. Increased levels of soluble TNF receptors are also found in the serum of patients with lichen planus. A recent report also has shown that polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha gene are associated with both oral and cutaneous lichen planus. Finally, thalidomide, which partly functions as a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha transcription, has been shown to be effective (in small case series and reports) in selected patients for the treatment of oral and genital lichen planus. However, thalidomide is a potent teratogen and cannot be used in women of childbearing potential. In addition, thalidomide usage not uncommonly results in neurotoxicity, which can be permanent, and thus limits use of this drug. Despite the evidence for a role of TNF-alpha in LP there are no reports of any TNF inhibitors being used for this disease.

This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to observe the safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with lichen planus.

This study will consist of 3 periods: first, a double-blind period (weeks 0-12) in which subjects will be randomized to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly or placebo; second, an open-label period (weeks 12-24) in which subjects who were randomized to placebo treatment, who have not achieved a complete remission, will be rolled over to use etanercept at 50 mg twice weekly. Subjects who previously received etanercept during weeks 0-12, who have not achieved a complete remission, will be continued on etanercept at a lower dosage of 25 mg twice weekly for weeks 12-24; third, an 8 week follow-up period for all subjects.","Inclusion Criteria:

Lichen planus affects up to 1% of the worldwide population. Recent estimates suggest approximately 0.44% of the US population suffers from this disease. Oral or genital involvement occurs in 60-70% of patients, and it may be the sole manifestation of disease in 20-30% of patients. Lichen planus is a mucocutaneous disorder that can involve the skin, oral or genital mucosa, conjunctiva, and nails. On the skin, the disease presents as multiple papules, which can be localized or generalized, that are often extremely itchy. Mucosal disease can consist of either asymptomatic plaques or extremely painful erosive lesions. The disease course is unpredictable and typically lasts 1-2 years but can follow a chronic, relapsing course. Erosive mucosal disease is important to aggressively treat for many reasons: First, the associated pain can be debilitating for the patient. Patients with severe oral lichen planus can become malnourished due to pain associated with eating. Vulvar disease can cause dyspareunia, burning pain, and discharge; second, the disease tends to be chronic, with little chance for self-resolution; third, erosive disease is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in the affected areas. These cancers occur in up to 1% of patients over a 3-year period, and they can be aggressive and even-life threatening for the patient if not recognized and treated early. Several lines of evidence suggest that TNF-alpha plays a role in the pathogenesis of lichen planus. It has been shown that there are increased levels of TNF-alpha in the serum of these patients. In addition, skin and mucosal biopsies show increased TNF-alpha produced by the infiltrating lymphocytes as well as the basal keratinocytes. It has been suggested that the expression of TNF-alpha receptor on the basal keratinocytes may contribute to apoptosis. Also, TNFR1 (a TNF-alpha receptor) is expressed by the infiltrating mononuclear cells as well as the keratinocytes. Increased levels of soluble TNF receptors are also found in the serum of patients with lichen planus. A recent report also has shown that polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha gene are associated with both oral and cutaneous lichen planus. Finally, thalidomide, which partly functions as a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha transcription, has been shown to be effective (in small case series and reports) in selected patients for the treatment of oral and genital lichen planus. However, thalidomide is a potent teratogen and cannot be used in women of childbearing potential. In addition, thalidomide usage not uncommonly results in neurotoxicity, which can be permanent, and thus limits use of this drug. Despite the evidence for a role of TNF-alpha in LP there are no reports of any TNF inhibitors being used for this disease. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to observe the safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with lichen planus. This study will consist of 3 periods: first, a double-blind period (weeks 0-12) in which subjects will be randomized to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly or placebo; second, an open-label period (weeks 12-24) in which subjects who were randomized to placebo treatment, who have not achieved a complete remission, will be rolled over to use etanercept at 50 mg twice weekly. Subjects who previously received etanercept during weeks 0-12, who have not achieved a complete remission, will be continued on etanercept at a lower dosage of 25 mg twice weekly for weeks 12-24; third, an 8 week follow-up period for all subjects.

University of Texas at Austin,OTHER,NCT04063384,Acute Alcohol Response In Bipolar Disorder: a fMRI Study,Subjective Response to Alcohol and Associated Neural Systems in Bipolar Disorder,"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect up to 60% of individuals with bipolar disorder during their lifetime-a rate 3 to 5 times higher than what occurs in the general population. The mechanisms that contribute to elevated rates of comorbidity are not known. Early identification in individuals with bipolar disorder who are at risk for AUDs could inform novel intervention strategies and improve life-long outcomes. The primary objective of this protocol is to use alcohol administration procedures and functional MRI techniques to investigate subjective response to alcohol, compared to placebo, and relationship with functional responses of, and connectivity among, brain regions in ventral prefrontal emotional networks in young adults with bipolar disorder and healthy comparison young adults. Baseline clinical and structural MRI assessments will be completed in 30 bipolar and 30 healthy young adults (21-26 years of age, 50% women). Then, following standard beverage administration procedures, participants will complete within-person, counter-balanced, fMRI scans and complete measures of subjective response to alcohol while under the influence of alcohol or placebo. Specifically, individual differences in the experience of stimulating, sedative, and anxiolytic effects of alcohol (measured with self-report surveys) and individual differences in neural responses to alcohol within ventral prefrontal emotional networks will be investigated and differences in bipolar disorder compared to healthy participants assessed. Functional MRI scans during a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral distractors (CPT-END) and at rest will be collected while under the influence of alcohol and placebo and compared. Experience of stimulating, sedative, and anxiolytic effects of alcohol from self-report survey data and neural responses to emotional stimuli while under the influence of alcohol compared to placebo will be the primary data outcomes assessed. Additionally, associations between subjective and neural response to alcohol and drinking patterns will be explored (secondary outcomes). The primary endpoint of the study will be after completion of both alcohol and placebo beverage conditions.","A total of 60 bipolar and healthy comparison subjects (n=30 per group, 21-26 years of age, 50% women, with no history of a moderate/severe AUD) will be recruited from the greater Austin area. Once recruited and enrolled, subjects will undergo detailed structured clinical evaluations to verify inclusion and exclusion criteria, comprehensive assessment of alcohol and other drug use history, and cognitive testing, followed by structural MRI assessments. Following standard beverage administration procedures, they will then complete measures of subjective response to alcohol and fMRI scans while under the influence of alcohol or a placebo condition (counter-balanced). For each participant the first beverage session assignment (whether the participant is given alcohol or the placebo beverage first) will be randomized. Alcohol and placebo sessions will occur within 3 days of each other. FMRI assessments will include a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral distractors (CPT-END) and a resting state scan.

For both the alcohol and the placebo beverage conditions, the protocol will be the same. The beverage administration sessions will occur in a private room at the University of Texas at Austin in the Imaging Research Center. The table in the testing room will be wiped down with alcohol prior to the participant's arrival (olfactory cue). Study staff will use an algorithm to calculate individual alcohol doses based on the participants' age, sex, height, and weight. Participants fast from food for 4 hours prior to their session. Before beginning consumption of their beverages, they will eat a weight-adjusted, 1 calorie per pound snack of pretzels. While participants eat their pretzels, study staff will mix beverages in front of participants. Vodka and placebo (decarbonated tonic water) will be stored in absolute vodka bottles, measured out, and combined with mixer in front of participants. Mixed drinks will be poured into glasses that have been sitting face down with rims soaking in vodka. Prior to giving the beverage to the participant, all drinks will get an alcohol floater (squirt of absolute vodka on top of the drink). Participants will be given 20 minutes to orally consume two beverages (10 minutes per beverage).

Following oral consumption and a 10 minute absorption period, breathalyzer tests will be conducted to identify a .06g% ascending limb breath alcohol concentration (BrAC). Self-report of subjective response to alcohol will be collected and participants will immediately enter the scanner and complete the fMRI scan (acquisition parameters are identical during alcohol and placebo conditions). BrAC will be tracked after the MRI scan and subjective response to alcohol collected again at peak BrAC and at descending BrAC of .06g%. Consistent with NIAAA guidelines for human alcohol studies, BrAC readings will continue every 30 minutes until participants are below 0.04% at which time they will be escorted home. During the placebo condition, participants will be given false BrAC readings. False BrAC readings given to participants during the placebo session will be based on the average BrACs we record during the alcohol sessions. The average time participants stay in the laboratory will be the same for the placebo and alcohol beverage conditions. Participants are debriefed after completing all sessions and the need for deception to ensure the placebo-controlled alcohol session will be explained.","Inclusion Criteria:

The investigators are planning to compare both techniques in both experienced (anesthesiologist board member) and non-experienced practitioners (first and second-grade resident).","Unintended arterial puncture and local hematoma formation are the most common complications during internal jugular vein central venous catheterization. Other serious complications like pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, arterial dissection, thrombosis, embolism are also possible. These complications mostly occur by mechanical trauma or injury when advancing needle back and forth to puncture internal jugular vein. Placement of guidewire or dilator can also cause mechanical trauma or injury around the vessel.

Because internal jugular vein collapses easily during needle advance, anterior and posterior wall of the vessel can be punctured simultaneously. Posterior wall puncture can increase the risk of complications of the catheterization. Delicate puncture of the vessel and stable fixation of the needle after puncture are important to reduce overall number of catheterization attempts, increase success rate, reduce complications.

Seldinger technique(thin-wall needle technique) is commonly used procedure to obtain safe access to central vein. The desired vessel is punctured with a sharp hollow needle, syringe is detached and guidewire is advanced through the lumen of the needle, and then the needle is withdrawn. Central catheter is then passed over the guidewire into the vessel. Contrarily, modified Seldinger technique(guiding sheath-over-the-needle technique) use needle that is covered with guiding sheath. After desired vessel puncture, guiding sheath is instantly slid over the needle into the vessel. The needle is withdrawn, guidewire is advanced through the guiding sheath, central catheter is placed into the vessel.

When using Seldinger technique, it is important to fix the needle firmly with hand until the guidewire is placed into the vessel lumen. If hand fixation is not stable, needle tip can migrate from the lumen, can pierce the vessel wall, and carotid artery puncture, and local hematoma formation might occur. Even if there is no evidence of complications, when blood regurgitation fails, overall number of vessel puncture attempts would increase and it is expected that rate of complications of the catheterization would increase.

When using modified Seldinger technique, guiding sheath is easily slid over the needle, providing stable route into the vessel lumen relatively in early step of the catheterization. Therefore, it is expected that stability of the fixation improves, success rate of the catheterization increase, and complications of the catheterization decrease. But there is no high level of evidence yet, and still decision to use which technique is based on experience of the operator.

The investigators are going to compare the Seldinger technique and modified Seldinger technique on success rate and complications during central venous catheterization by prospective, randomized, controlled study.

In addition, any difference in success rate and complications between the two techniques may be different depending on the experience of the practitioners. Therefore, the investigators also plan to compare the two techniques between experienced and non-experienced practitioners.

The success rate and complications between the two techniques may also be different depending on the long and short-axis techniques. As subgroup analyses, we intend to investigate whether there is a difference between Seldinger and modified Seldinger technique according to the experience of the operator or long or short axis approach.","Inclusion Criteria:

The desired vessel is punctured with a sharp hollow needle, syringe is detached and guidewire is advanced through the lumen of the needle, and then the needle is withdrawn. Central catheter is then passed over the guidewire into the vessel. Contrarily, modified Seldinger technique(guiding sheath-over-the-needle technique) use needle that is covered with guiding sheath. After desired vessel puncture, guiding sheath is instantly slid over the needle into the vessel. The needle is withdrawn, guidewire is advanced through the guiding sheath, central catheter is placed into the vessel. When using Seldinger technique, it is important to fix the needle firmly with hand until the guidewire is placed into the vessel lumen. If hand fixation is not stable, needle tip can migrate from the lumen, can pierce the vessel wall, and carotid artery puncture, and local hematoma formation might occur. Even if there is no evidence of complications, when blood regurgitation fails, overall number of vessel puncture attempts would increase and it is expected that rate of complications of the catheterization would increase. When using modified Seldinger technique, guiding sheath is easily slid over the needle, providing stable route into the vessel lumen relatively in early step of the catheterization. Therefore, it is expected that stability of the fixation improves, success rate of the catheterization increase, and complications of the catheterization decrease. But there is no high level of evidence yet, and still decision to use which technique is based on experience of the operator. The investigators are going to compare the Seldinger technique and modified Seldinger technique on success rate and complications during central venous catheterization by prospective, randomized, controlled study. In addition, any difference in success rate and complications between the two techniques may be different depending on the experience of the practitioners. Therefore, the investigators also plan to compare the two techniques between experienced and non-experienced practitioners. The success rate and complications between the two techniques may also be different depending on the long and short-axis techniques. As subgroup analyses, we intend to investigate whether there is a difference between Seldinger and modified Seldinger technique according to the experience of the operator or long or short axis approach.

Damascus University,OTHER,NCT04569279,Rivaroxaban vs. Warfarin in CVT Treatment,Rivaroxaban Compared to Warfarin for Treatment of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon venous-type of stroke tends to affect younger patients with somewhat different risk factors and much better outcome compared to arterial strokes. Anti-coagulation is the standard of treatment for patients with (CVT) initially with heparins followed by other oral blood thinners for several months. In this study, the investigators are comparing warfarin with another well-known blood thinner, rivaroxaban, which has a fixed once-daily dose with no need for monitoring in terms of clinical outcomes and complications.","Background:

Cerebral venous and/or dural sinus thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon but increasingly recognized form of stroke accounts for up to 1% of all cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs), with an estimated incidence of 5 cases per million people per year, it usually affects young patients with a female to male ratio of 3:1.

The pathogenesis of CVT is still not entirely clear. Partly because of the highly variable venous anatomy and the shortage of animal studies. However, decreased venous blood flow drainage and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption may lead to elevation of intracranial pressure and/or cerebral parenchymal lesions or dysfunction that may contribute to the clinical features of CVT.

Diagnosis and management of (CVT) can be challenging given the diversity of causes and risk factors with a wide range of symptoms and signs. At least one identifiable risk factor was found in 85% of patients of the (ISCVT) study while multiple predisposing factors were found in 44%. The most common risk factors were oral contraceptives and inherited and acquired thrombophilia conditions.

the most common symptom is headache. It is found in 90% of patients with (CVT) usually associated with focal neurological symptoms or seizures. Isolated headaches account only for 15% of patients.

diagnosis of (CVT) depends on high level of clinical suspicion followed by neuroimaging (preferably some specific MRI modalities).

Anti-coagulation is the standard of treatment for patients with (CVT) based on small randomized clinical trials and reviews and wide consensus opinion of most experts.There is still no solid evidence from large randomized clinical trials. It is thought that anticoagulation may stop growth of the thrombus and permit recanalization mechanisms . it also may hinder other thrombotic events.

A trial compared an adjusted doses of intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) with placebo was stopped early after 20 of the planned 60 patients were enrolled because there was an obvious benefit of treatment.

Based on consensus, current recommendations for the duration of anticoagulation in patients with (CVT) are dependent mainly on the presence of provoking factor/s which may be transient or persistent. Thus duration ranges from 3 to 6 months for reversible causes (e.g. OCP) of provoked (CVT) to indefinite treatment period of anticoagulation for recurrent unprovoked (CVT) or severe thrombophilia state. Traditionally, warfarin is used after a bridging period of Heparins with INR target 2.0 to 3.0.

Rivaroxaban is a selective reversible anti-Factor X anticoagulant, that has a good bioavailability, much predictable pharmacokinetics, and maybe a lower risk for major bleeding in comparison to warfarin. Therefore, laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments are almost unnecessary. However, rivaroxaban has not been thoroughly studied for CVT.

The objective of the study:

To compare warfarin to rivaroxaban in CVT patients in terms of short and long term outcomes, and complications.

Methods:

planned sample: 60 patients. study design: Subjects will be enrolled from Damascus University hospitals (Almouassat University hospital, and Alassad University hospital) and Almujtahed (Damascus public hospital) and randomly assigned to the two arms of the study (rivaroxaban or warfarin) using web-based random number generator application called ""Research Randomizer. The warfarin arm will serve as the control group. No blinding will be applied due to safety and ethical issues.

Subjects will be followed up monthly for 6 months to evaluate clinical outcomes.

Subjects confirmed to have elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) will receive Acetazolamide 500 mg (bid) for two weeks then will be tapered gradually if possible as needed.

Concomitant use of any anticonvulsants will be recorded for further sub-groups analysis.

Used measures:

* Sinus venous thrombosis severity scale (SVTSS)
* Patient's independency using Barthel index.
* intracranial pressure (ICP) using fundoscopy, or direct ICP measuring.
* diagnostic DSA, CT and MRI scans.
* Hemoglobin level for hemorrhagic complications.
* INR test to adjust the warfarin doses.

Quality assurance plan, Data checks, and Source data verification:

The data will be collected by the investigators directly from the patients, their families, and their medical records. at least two investigators will evaluate each patient to affirm objective and accurate assessment of outcome measures. The data will be entered manually after collection into a Google Forms page that contains fields of all the required data, which will automatically produce the corresponding Excel sheet. The principal investigator will review and double-check the collected data and comparing the final excel sheet with patients' data collected from patients and their surrogates' interviews, their medical files, imaging reports, and chats.

Plan for Data Analysis:

Percentages for nominal input, Medians for clinical scores. For continuous outcomes, the investigators will use Mann Whitney test for two-group data, and Kruskal Wallis for 3+ data groups. Nominal outcomes: Chi-square when the assumptions apply, and Fisher exact test when they don't. The analysis will be done using SPSS 25 software primarily, along with EXCEL.

Missing data will be treated as per the professional statistical methods.

Appendix 1:

To avoid any subjective bias, the investigators will define each element of (SVTSS) scale as the following:

● headache severity will be scaled depending on the ""Functional Pain Scale (FPS)"" as Slight (2), Moderate (4 - 6), Severe (8 - 10).

functional pain scale detailed as follows: 0: No pain. 2: Tolerable, activities not prevented. 4: Tolerable prevents some activities. 6: Intolerable prevents many active (not passive) activities. 8: Intolerable, prevents all active and many passive activities. 10: Intolerable incapacitated, unable to do anything or speak due to pain.

Active activities: usual activities or those requiring effort (turning, walking, etc.) Passive activities: talking on phone, watching TV, reading

● Focal signs:

* Transient: lasting less than 24 hours.
* Mild paresis: any degree of minimal persistent weakness that can only be noticed by comparing with the other side.
* Moderate paresis: obvious weakness but still can move limb against gravity.
* Severe Paresis: any limb movement but not against gravity or complete plegia.

The investigators will consider any other focal neurologic sign (e.g. cranial nerve lesions or palsies) as a focal paresis and will be scaled as mild if minimal defect, moderate if obvious defect, and severe if leads to functional disability (e.g. visual loss). The investigators will except abducens nerve palsies from scaling and consider any degree of diplopia as ""Mild paresis"".

If multiple focal neurologic deficits are present. Patients will be scored upon the most severe focal sign.

● Seizures: the investigators define seizure as a clinical convulsive seizure.

Obvious other cause/s of seizure/s not related to a new complication of the disease or anticoagulation treatment (e.g. poor compliance with anticonvulsant drugs) will not affect the severity scale (i.e. changing SVTSS score).

● Consciousness: depending on Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 32nd edition the investigators define:

* Confusion: disturbed orientation in regard to time, place, or person.
* Psychosis: a mental disorder characterized by gross impairment in reality testing as evidenced by delusions, hallucinations, markedly incoherent speech, or disorganized and agitated behavior.
* Somnolence: drowsiness or sleepiness, particularly in excess.
* Stupor: a lowered level of consciousness manifested by the subject's responding only to vigorous stimulation.
* Coma: a state of unconsciousness from which the patient cannot be aroused, even by powerful stimulation.
* Dead: destitute of life.

Any new/worsening focal sign, new/relapsing seizure/s, or deterioration in the level of consciousness will be documented and promptly investigated as a probable worsening in severity scale due to disease (i.e. CVT) or treatment complication/s (e.g. intracranial hemorrhage) and will prompt emergent evaluation and repeating neuroimaging as needed.","Inclusion Criteria:

* patients aged 14 years or older and weighing more than 50 kg.

Secondary end-points include a reduction in exacerbation rates by 25%, a reduction in health-related costs and an increase in survival during the year following intervention.

Material and methods :

This interventional, multi-centre, prospective, two-armed parallel, controlled trial is being conducted in 200 patients. In both groups, ""Control"" and ""Rehabilitation"", 7 home visits are scheduled during the 3-month intervention for education purpose. In the ""Rehabilitation"" group, patients will receive 160 mg/d of oral testosterone undecanoate in men, 80 mg/d in women, oral dietary supplements (563 kcal/d) and exercises on an ergometric bicycle 3 to 5 times a week.

Expected results :

In the event of significant responses to intervention, this trial would validate a comprehensive and global home-care for undernourished patients with chronic respiratory failure combining therapeutic education, oral supplements, androgenic substitution and physical activity.","Inclusion Criteria:
