Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki,OTHER,NCT02725879,FGF-21 Levels and RMR in Children and Adolescents With Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (THYROMETABOL),"Association of Serum Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF-21) Levels With Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), in Children and Adolescents With Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.","It is well documented that thyroid hormones (THs) are involved in energy and lipid metabolism, thermogenesis, and body weight control, acting on several tissues. Thus, any change in thyroid status may affect body weight and metabolic rate. On the other hand, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) is a complex hormone involved in energy, lipid, and glucose metabolism, sharing common biochemical pathways and sites of action with THs. FGF-21 is synthesized and acts primarily on the liver, but weaker expression has also been described in muscle, pancreas, and adipose tissue. In addition, FGF-21 acts through endocrine and paracrine mechanisms, regulating metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, and thermogenesis. Recent animal and human studies have highlighted a close bidirectional relationship between FGF-21 and THs, partially elucidated. Thyroid hormones regulate the expression of the FGF-21 gene in the liver and can also increase FGF-21 levels in vivo. However, it has also been suggested that some of their key actions are largely independent. Data on FGF-21 levels and their metabolic role in pediatric patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) are scarce. This study aims to measure FGF-21 serum levels in children and adolescents with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and investigate any possible associations between FGF-21 serum levels and resting metabolic rate (RMR) and levothyroxine (LT4) treatment, or other clinical and biochemical parameters.","Children and adolescents, aged 5-18 years, will undergo routine screening for chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) at the Pediatric Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic of ""Papageorgiou"" General Hospital and ""AHEPA"" University Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece. The diagnosis of AIT will be based on the presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies (Anti-TPOAb and/or Anti-TgAb) and one or more of the following: clinical symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, goiter, or diffuse/irregular hypoechogenicity of the thyroid gland during an ultrasound examination.

All participants should have a normal body mass index (BMI) for their age and sex, be drug-naive for at least 3 months, follow no special diet, and have no chronic and/or acute disease or menstrual disorder. Only those subjects that will start routine LT4 treatment will be reassessed at six months (not the rest participants), with no specific intervention to take place during those six months.

For all participants, a detailed medical history will be recorded. The following parameters will be measured and calculated: age and pubertal stage according to Tanner, height, body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and skinfolds measurement in order to estimate the percentage of body fat (%BF). The resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be measured with a portable device applying indirect calorimetry. Blood samples will be collected after overnight fasting.

The following parameters will be tested in serum: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (Anti-TPOAb) titers, thyroglobulin antibody (Anti-TgAb) titers, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γglutamyltransferase (γ-GT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), applying an automatic chemical analyzer or immunoassay system and analogs reagents that already exist at the hospital. Serum FGF-21 levels will be determined in pg/mL using the Solid Phase Sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Additionally, all participants, with the help of their parents and/or caregivers, will complete the Mediterranean Diet Index (KIDMED) at their first visit.","Inclusion Criteria:

Despite intensified standard measure of TB control, TB case detection rates are low, posing major hurdles for TB control. It is estimated that approximately 50% of patients with TB are still not diagnosed and treated appropriately. The problem is compounded by the increasing prevalence of multi drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB and the close association between TB and HIV infection.

Diagnostic tools introduced 100 years ago are still in routine use and increasingly inaccurate if the face of the HIV and TB syndemics. Consequently, many patients with active TB remain undiagnosed and continue to spread the disease within the community. Thus, missed or delayed diagnosis results in ongoing transmission, patient morbidity and mortality, and social and economic consequences. Currently, there is no available point-of-care, or even point-of-treatment test that allows early detection of active tuberculosis at the peripheral health clinic level. Lack of rapid, simple and accurate diagnostic tests at this level is a major hurdle in controlling the global burden of TB. A number of promising new TB diagnostics have shown initial promise but there remains an urgent need to assess their impact when used at the point-of-treatment in primary care level.

In 2009, Cepheid released the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay, which is the only system able to deliver answers directly from unprocessed samples by combining on-board preparation of the sample with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in less than 2 hours. Additionally, the Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay allows for simultaneous on-demand molecular testing for the detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) and rifampicin (frontline anti-TB drug) resistance. . The GeneXpert™ system consists of a GeneXpert instrument, personal computer and disposable fluidic cartridges.

Xpert has now been shown to be an accurate tool for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis in both smear-positive and smear-negative samples in both a multicentre evaluation and demonstration study with a sensitivity of approximately 70% in smear negative culture positive TB. Xpert testing in both these studies was performed at microscopy laboratories. In December 2010, on the basis of these results, Xpert was endorsed for TB diagnosis by the World Health Organisation (WHO) but is yet to be integrated into national tuberculosis control programmes.

The investigators team has developed a robot designed to rehabilitate the upper limb. This robot allows the patient to perform active, passive, or assisted exercises.

This therapy is designed to improve functional recovery of patients, and then their quality of life.

In this study, 60 stroke patients will be recruited and randomized into two groups. All patients will receive a similar classical rehabilitation as a basis. Patients of the control and experimental groups will receive a supplement of classical rehabilitation and robotic-assisted therapy, respectively.","INTRODUCTION

The cerebral vascular accident affects two people per thousand each year (Duncan et al. 2005). This injury is the leading cause of permanent disability in our population. The brain damage is expressed by different neurological impairments and functional disabilities. These disabilities justify intensive and sustained multidisciplinary rehabilitation to reduce neurological impairments, to improve the activities and participation of patients, and, ultimately, their quality of life (Duncan et al., 2005).

Recently appeared in rehabilitation to stimulate maximum brain plasticity robotic devices meet the actual recommendations existing in stroke's rehabilitation (Langhorne et al., 2011). Indeed, the robots allow the execution of a large number of movements whose quality is controlled. A visual interface gives the patient a feedback of its movements, and offers exercises oriented functional tasks that have meaning for him and the possibly dive into a virtual reality. All these elements justify the clinical development of robots to assist the therapists (Pignolo et al. 2009).

The therapeutic efficacy of these robots for the rehabilitation of the upper limb was evaluated especially in chronic stroke patients (\> 6 months after stroke) (Mehrholz et al., 2012). Unfortunately, few quality studies was conducted in these patients at the acute stage of rehabilitation, during which the potential of brain plasticity is the most important and the largest functional progress are observed (Stinear et al. 2012). In addition, few studies have evaluated the effect of these therapies robotic on the three fields of the ICF (Mehrholz et al., 2012). Many studies focus on impairments (e.g. muscle strength) without assessing the functional ability of the patient in activities of daily living.

OBJECTIVES

To perform a multicenter, single blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of of robotic-assisted therapy in acute stroke patients by evaluating the three fields of the ICF.

METHODS

Patients will be included in the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (Brussels, Belgique) and the center of William Lennox (Ottignies, Belgique). The patients will be randomised into two groups (control and experimental), using a stratified randomization method to ensure the equivalence of the two groups for motor neurological impairments (score of the Fugl-Meyer). This randomization will be organized independently in each centre participating in the study. The study of statistical power shows that 27 patients per group are necessary. This study of power has taken into account a statistical power desired to 99%, a minimum detectable change to 0.09 and a standard deviation of 0.08 on the upper limb kinematics of the patient (Gilliaux et al. 2014). In estimating a risk of out drop to 10%, the investigators plan to recruit 60 patients.

In each centre, in the acute phase, the patients receive daily a multidisciplinary rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy,...) more or less intensive (60 to 300 min). In the experimental group, one of these daily therapies will be devoted to the rehabilitation robot, 4 times a week for 9 weeks. The control group will benefit from conventional treatments. As such, the duration of support will be similar between the two groups. All treatments will be administered by therapists specialized in neurological rehabilitation.

Patients will be evaluated three times in the study: before the start of treatments, at the end of treatments, and 6 months after the stroke event. All assessments will be carried out by a therapist which will be not informed the group that the patient is assigned (single-blind).

PERSPECTIVES

From this study, the investigators hope to demonstrate the efficacy of robotic-assisted therapy in acute stroke patients by evaluating the three fields of the ICF. These results could prove that this tool can be a significant complement for the stroke rehabilitation.","Inclusion Criteria:

The therapeutic efficacy of these robots for the rehabilitation of the upper limb was evaluated especially in chronic stroke patients (\> 6 months after stroke) (Mehrholz et al., 2012). Unfortunately, few quality studies was conducted in these patients at the acute stage of rehabilitation, during which the potential of brain plasticity is the most important and the largest functional progress are observed (Stinear et al. 2012). In addition, few studies have evaluated the effect of these therapies robotic on the three fields of the ICF (Mehrholz et al., 2012). Many studies focus on impairments (e.g. muscle strength) without assessing the functional ability of the patient in activities of daily living. OBJECTIVES To perform a multicenter, single blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of of robotic-assisted therapy in acute stroke patients by evaluating the three fields of the ICF. METHODS Patients will be included in the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (Brussels, Belgique) and the center of William Lennox (Ottignies, Belgique). The patients will be randomised into two groups (control and experimental), using a stratified randomization method to ensure the equivalence of the two groups for motor neurological impairments (score of the Fugl-Meyer). This randomization will be organized independently in each centre participating in the study. The study of statistical power shows that 27 patients per group are necessary. This study of power has taken into account a statistical power desired to 99%, a minimum detectable change to 0.09 and a standard deviation of 0.08 on the upper limb kinematics of the patient (Gilliaux et al. 2014). In estimating a risk of out drop to 10%, the investigators plan to recruit 60 patients. In each centre, in the acute phase, the patients receive daily a multidisciplinary rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy,...) more or less intensive (60 to 300 min). In the experimental group, one of these daily therapies will be devoted to the rehabilitation robot, 4 times a week for 9 weeks. The control group will benefit from conventional treatments. As such, the duration of support will be similar between the two groups. All treatments will be administered by therapists specialized in neurological rehabilitation. Patients will be evaluated three times in the study: before the start of treatments, at the end of treatments, and 6 months after the stroke event. All assessments will be carried out by a therapist which will be not informed the group that the patient is assigned (single-blind). PERSPECTIVES From this study, the investigators hope to demonstrate the efficacy of robotic-assisted therapy in acute stroke patients by evaluating the three fields of the ICF. These results could prove that this tool can be a significant complement for the stroke rehabilitation. Inclusion Criteria: * first stroke * acute stroke (less than 1 month) * unilateral localisation of the stroke * moderate to severe upper limb impairments (7\<Fugl Meyer score\<50/66) Exclusion Criteria: * brainstem or cerebellum stroke * an unstable clinical condition contraindicating the upper limb rehabilitation treatments * cognitive disorders preventing the understanding of the instructions * other neurological or orthopedic pathology affecting the upper limb"

Background: Since the advent of pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy in the early 1970's, there has been a remarkable increase in the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed in infants and children. Performance of endoscopy in children requires more patience, experience, and expertise than in adults. The anxiety of the children is related to parent's separation, loss of self-control, unknown surroundings and strange people that are taking care of them, and frequently unpleasant or even painful procedures. Painful and frightening procedures in children have been shown to result in short-term physiologic changes and long-term behavioral changes. The response to unpleasant stimuli with stress and fear may be exaggerated in children and experienced as pain. Most infants and children and many teenagers need deep sedation or light general anesthesia to complete a successful and safe procedure. Induction of general anesthesia is a stressful procedure itself. Strategies to reduce preanesthesia anxiety include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions.

However, this evidence is based mainly on self reports rather than objective measurements. Therefore, objective and non-invasive measurements to be utilized in the current study, should provide an assessment tools regardless the children's age.

Multiple studies, beginning in the 1970's, have shown that humor has many positive effects on physical and mental health and well-being. Previous investigations have reported that humor has beneficial effects on the immune system, stress related to potentially fatal illnesses, pain tolerance, and mental functions.

Dream doctors are professional medical clowns or stage artists, who received training specifically to understand medical patient's need and to give the patient adjuvant therapy during hospital admissions or ambulatory treatment. Laughter has physiological effects on different body mechanisms and it affects the cardiovascular system (decreasing heart rate and blood pressure), strengthens the immune system, and lowers level of stress hormones like Norepinephrine. Humor can also help in strengthening the bond between therapist and patient and reduce stress and anxiety and enhance recovery. The Israel dream doctors project, integrates professional medical clowning into the medical services provided at Israeli hospitals. The DDs are part of the multidisciplinary staff, principally but not only, in pediatric wards. Studies already proved that presence of medical clowns significantly reduces the level of anxiety during induction of anesthesia in children. In the pediatric ward in Afula Medical Center, the investigators have experience with DDs for preparing children to kidney scans.

Pre-Puls Inhibition PPI A computerized human startle response monitoring system (SR-HLAB STARTLE REFLEX, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) was used to deliver acoustic startle stimuli via headphones and record and score the corresponding electro myographic activity from the orbicularis oculi muscle. Two disposable electrodes (sensor area 12 mm2) were placed approximately 0.75-1cm below the pupil on the orbicularis oculi muscle and 3rd reference electrode on the mastoid bone. The skin area at the electrode site was cleaned with a cotton swab saturated with rubbing alcohol, then prepared by gently rubbing a small amount of EEG \& ECG Skin Prepping Gel (Signa Gel- Parker Laboratories Inc., Fairfield, New jersey, USA), and cleaned again with a cotton swab.

The session (a total of 56 trials) is started with 3 min acclimatization period with a 60 dB background noise level that is delivered continuously throughout the test session. The session is comprised from two blocks. block1: comprised from randomly delivered six trials of single 40 msec 120 dB ""pulse alone"" startle stimuli in order to evaluate the startle response, ten ""pre"" stimuli (at 74, 78, 82, 86 or 92 dB), and thirty ""pre pulse"" trials that consisted of a single 120 dB pulse preceded (120 msec inter-stimulus-interval) by a 20 msec pre pulse of 14, 18, 22, 26 or 32 dB above background (i.e., 74, 78, 82, 86 or 92 dB). Block1 trials were delivered on average 20 sec inter-trial-interval ITI (15-25 sec, total 46 trials). Block2: comprised of the last ten trials of ""pulse alone"" startle, at fixed 2 sec ITI in order to evaluate a measure of habituation in response to repeated delivery of the startling stimuli. Finally, prepulse inhibition (PPI) was calculated as the percent of the habituated response as follows \[100-(max response to ""pre pulse"" trial / max response to ""pulse alone"" trial X 100)\]

GSR - Galvanic Skin Response Electrodermal activity will be measured by the differences of the skin conductivity. Two 5 mm electrodes will be placed on fingers 2 and 4 of the non-dominant hand. The electrodes will be connected to sensor and amplifying receiver with a 10Hz sampling rate.

Different portions of the skin can show differences in conductivity, due to sweat related to stress. Thus, measuring the skin conductivity of the non-dominant hand was shown to reduce this variability.

Hypothesis of the study: 1) DDs lessen the level of anxiety and attention impairment in children undergoing gastroscopies. 2) DDs improve the satisfaction of children and their parents during gastroscopies.

The aim of this study is: 1) To explore the influence of DDs on the satisfaction of children and their parents undergoing gastroscopy, utilizing questioners. 2) To explore the effects of DDs on anxiety and attention of children and their parents, undergoing gastroscopies by means of GSR, startle response and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) tests and measuring anxiety-related biologic indices.

Patients and Methods: This randomized, controlled study will be conducted with children undergoing deep sedation during pediatric upper gastrointestinal endoscopies in the Gastroenterology institute of the Emek Medical Center,Afula, Israel. One hundred children (age 1-18 years) scheduled to undergo deep sedation and elective gastroscopy will be enrolled. During enrollment, the potential clown involvement will be explained to parents. Patients will be assigned to one of two groups: Group 1:children and their parents with the presence of DD upon arrival to the Gastroenterology institute and throughout the induction of sedation, gastroscopy and recovery. Group 2: children and their parents undergoing gastroscopy with deep sedation without the presence of a DD.

The randomization process: In Afula Medical Center, the investigators perform gastroscopies weekly. During the study period the investigators will perform the gastroscopies one week with the DD and one week without the DD.The patients will not be aware to that fact that in some weeks the DD is participating during the sedation induction in some of the patients (every other week). The DD will use various methods for entertaining the child and alleviate stress according to the child's age. The parents and the children will be given anxiety questioners to fill before the induction of sedation. At the end of the gastroscopy the parents and the children will be given satisfaction questioners. The children will perform Pre-Pulse inhibition (PPI) test and GSR before and after the gastroscopy to assess physiological and biological emotional and cognitive consequences. The parents will perform PPI test and GSR before, during and after the gastroscopy (no caffeine or nicotine consumption will be allowed 30min before examination). The anesthesiologist and the nurse at the recovery room will fill a questioner evaluating the behavior of the child during the induction of sedation and awakening. While inserting an IV line blood spots will be taken for stress hormones: cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. The following physical indices will be measured: blood pressure, pulse, saturation and body temperature. The amount of drugs given for deep sedation will be evaluated.

The current study hold two major innovativeness: (a) The effects of DD as part of the medical team in gastroscopy in children. (b) The physiological and biological evaluation of the emotional and cognitive consequences in children and their parents during gastroscopy.

Statistical analysis:

The study design is Mixed design (2X3), with DD as between subject factor (with or without DD) and stage of treatment as within subject factor (prior, during and after gastroscopy examination).Thus, we will conduct a Two-Way ANOVA (2X3) with post hoc Tukey's test. Significant interactions will be further analyzed with One-Way ANOVA. Moreover to relate physiological and biological measurement to questioner items, Pearson's correlations will be calculated.

The study schedule:

1. Recruitment: 1.5 year
2. Study period: for each patient the study will be held during the day of gastroscopy.

Dream doctors are professional medical clowns or stage artists, who received training specifically to understand medical patient's need and to give the patient adjuvant therapy during hospital admissions or ambulatory treatment. Laughter has physiological effects on different body mechanisms and it affects the cardiovascular system (decreasing heart rate and blood pressure), strengthens the immune system, and lowers level of stress hormones like Norepinephrine. Humor can also help in strengthening the bond between therapist and patient and reduce stress and anxiety and enhance recovery. The Israel dream doctors project, integrates professional medical clowning into the medical services provided at Israeli hospitals. The DDs are part of the multidisciplinary staff, principally but not only, in pediatric wards. Studies already proved that presence of medical clowns significantly reduces the level of anxiety during induction of anesthesia in children. In the pediatric ward in Afula Medical Center, the investigators have experience with DDs for preparing children to kidney scans. Pre-Puls Inhibition PPI A computerized human startle response monitoring system (SR-HLAB STARTLE REFLEX, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) was used to deliver acoustic startle stimuli via headphones and record and score the corresponding electro myographic activity from the orbicularis oculi muscle. Two disposable electrodes (sensor area 12 mm2) were placed approximately 0.75-1cm below the pupil on the orbicularis oculi muscle and 3rd reference electrode on the mastoid bone. The skin area at the electrode site was cleaned with a cotton swab saturated with rubbing alcohol, then prepared by gently rubbing a small amount of EEG \& ECG Skin Prepping Gel (Signa Gel- Parker Laboratories Inc., Fairfield, New jersey, USA), and cleaned again with a cotton swab. The session (a total of 56 trials) is started with 3 min acclimatization period with a 60 dB background noise level that is delivered continuously throughout the test session. The session is comprised from two blocks. block1: comprised from randomly delivered six trials of single 40 msec 120 dB ""pulse alone"" startle stimuli in order to evaluate the startle response, ten ""pre"" stimuli (at 74, 78, 82, 86 or 92 dB), and thirty ""pre pulse"" trials that consisted of a single 120 dB pulse preceded (120 msec inter-stimulus-interval) by a 20 msec pre pulse of 14, 18, 22, 26 or 32 dB above background (i.e., 74, 78, 82, 86 or 92 dB). Block1 trials were delivered on average 20 sec inter-trial-interval ITI (15-25 sec, total 46 trials). Block2: comprised of the last ten trials of ""pulse alone"" startle, at fixed 2 sec ITI in order to evaluate a measure of habituation in response to repeated delivery of the startling stimuli. Finally, prepulse inhibition (PPI) was calculated as the percent of the habituated response as follows \[100-(max response to ""pre pulse"" trial / max response to ""pulse alone"" trial X 100)\] GSR - Galvanic Skin Response Electrodermal activity will be measured by the differences of the skin conductivity. Two 5 mm electrodes will be placed on fingers 2 and 4 of the non-dominant hand. The electrodes will be connected to sensor and amplifying receiver with a 10Hz sampling rate. Different portions of the skin can show differences in conductivity, due to sweat related to stress. Thus, measuring the skin conductivity of the non-dominant hand was shown to reduce this variability. Hypothesis of the study: 1) DDs lessen the level of anxiety and attention impairment in children undergoing gastroscopies. 2) DDs improve the satisfaction of children and their parents during gastroscopies. The aim of this study is: 1) To explore the influence of DDs on the satisfaction of children and their parents undergoing gastroscopy, utilizing questioners. 2) To explore the effects of DDs on anxiety and attention of children and their parents, undergoing gastroscopies by means of GSR, startle response and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) tests and measuring anxiety-related biologic indices. Patients and Methods: This randomized, controlled study will be conducted with children undergoing deep sedation during pediatric upper gastrointestinal endoscopies in the Gastroenterology institute of the Emek Medical Center,Afula, Israel. One hundred children (age 1-18 years) scheduled to undergo deep sedation and elective gastroscopy will be enrolled. During enrollment, the potential clown involvement will be explained to parents. Patients will be assigned to one of two groups: Group 1:children and their parents with the presence of DD upon arrival to the Gastroenterology institute and throughout the induction of sedation, gastroscopy and recovery. Group 2: children and their parents undergoing gastroscopy with deep sedation without the presence of a DD. The randomization process: In Afula Medical Center, the investigators perform gastroscopies weekly. During the study period the investigators will perform the gastroscopies one week with the DD and one week without the DD.The patients will not be aware to that fact that in some weeks the DD is participating during the sedation induction in some of the patients (every other week). The DD will use various methods for entertaining the child and alleviate stress according to the child's age. The parents and the children will be given anxiety questioners to fill before the induction of sedation. At the end of the gastroscopy the parents and the children will be given satisfaction questioners. The children will perform Pre-Pulse inhibition (PPI) test and GSR before and after the gastroscopy to assess physiological and biological emotional and cognitive consequences. The parents will perform PPI test and GSR before, during and after the gastroscopy (no caffeine or nicotine consumption will be allowed 30min before examination). The anesthesiologist and the nurse at the recovery room will fill a questioner evaluating the behavior of the child during the induction of sedation and awakening. While inserting an IV line blood spots will be taken for stress hormones: cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. The following physical indices will be measured: blood pressure, pulse, saturation and body temperature. The amount of drugs given for deep sedation will be evaluated. The current study hold two major innovativeness: (a) The effects of DD as part of the medical team in gastroscopy in children. (b) The physiological and biological evaluation of the emotional and cognitive consequences in children and their parents during gastroscopy. Statistical analysis: The study design is Mixed design (2X3), with DD as between subject factor (with or without DD) and stage of treatment as within subject factor (prior, during and after gastroscopy examination).Thus, we will conduct a Two-Way ANOVA (2X3) with post hoc Tukey's test. Significant interactions will be further analyzed with One-Way ANOVA. Moreover to relate physiological and biological measurement to questioner items, Pearson's correlations will be calculated. The study schedule: 1. Recruitment: 1.5 year 2. Study period: for each patient the study will be held during the day of gastroscopy. 3. Examination of blood serum by ELISA: 3 months. 3. Analysis of results: three months 4. Targeted date as to completion of project: two years from the study beginning. Project staff: 1.

Tokat Gaziosmanpasa University,OTHER,NCT06675279,Psychometric Properties of the Turkish Version of the HANA in Migraine,The Headache Needs Assessment (HANA) Survey: Psychometric Properties of the Turkish Version in Migraine,"Migraine is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting numerous adults. Headaches are often associated with significant disruptions that can interrupt the patient's usual activities for hours. Although headaches are typically episodic, many individuals with migraine experience life restrictions due to the anticipation of future attacks and the prevalent concern that headaches will compromise their functional capabilities. Several health-related quality of life scales have been developed to assess migraine and its associated conditions. Some examples include the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Quality of Life and Migraine Scale, and the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Measure. While some of these scales have Turkish versions, others do not. Many of these instruments are designed for clinical research, offering comprehensive assessment but are disadvantaged by lengthy completion and scoring times for patients. There is a need for brief health status measures with simple scoring systems that can evaluate the overall impact of migraines on daily activities. The Headache Needs Assessment (HANA) is a seven-item questionnaire developed to assess migraine-related quality of life issues.

This study aims to validate and establish the reliability of the Turkish version of the Headache Needs Assessment for evaluating individuals with migraines. If proven valid and reliable, the Headache Needs Assessment will be a practical tool for assessing the quality of life in individuals with migraines.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The Turkish version of the Headache Needs Assessment is not valid and reliable.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The Turkish version of the Headache Needs Assessment is valid and reliable.","Migraine is a serious health problem that disrupts quality of life and ranks second among primary headaches, affecting over 10% of the general population. In Turkey, the lifetime prevalence of migraine is reported to be 16%, with rates of 10.9% in men and 21.8% in women. Migraine is characterized by episodic attacks that may include headaches accompanied by vomiting, nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia. Chronic migraine is defined as a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month for over three months, with migraine features present on at least 8 of those days. The International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for migraine require only two of four commonly seen pain features; thus, a non-throbbing, bilateral headache can still meet migraine criteria if it is moderate to severe, worsens with physical activity, and is accompanied by migraine-specific symptoms. Neck pain related to stress, which is sometimes associated with tension-type headache, is also a common feature of migraine.

Measurements play a crucial role in scientific research across various fields, including natural sciences, social sciences, and health sciences. In the biomedical sciences, many clinical conditions, psychological behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs are challenging to measure accurately. These may include disease severity, disease-related quality of life, pain perception, anxiety, and more. To quantify and assess specific attributes, researchers develop tools known as ""scales"" that consist of various components. Clinical scales are tools used in medicine to evaluate different aspects of a patient's health, including physical and mental health symptoms, functional abilities, and overall quality of life.

The Headache Needs Assessment (HANA) is designed to assess two dimensions of the chronic impact of migraine-related quality of life issues: frequency and discomfort. It comprises seven items and serves as a useful screening tool for evaluating the impact of migraine on individuals. Its two-dimensional approach to patient-reported quality of life enables individuals to weigh the influence of both the frequency and discomfort of chronic migraines on various aspects of daily life. This scale will fill a gap in the Turkish literature regarding the parameters it evaluates and will serve as a valuable tool in the field.","Inclusion Criteria:

Migraine is a serious health problem that disrupts quality of life and ranks second among primary headaches, affecting over 10% of the general population. In Turkey, the lifetime prevalence of migraine is reported to be 16%, with rates of 10.9% in men and 21.8% in women. Migraine is characterized by episodic attacks that may include headaches accompanied by vomiting, nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia. Chronic migraine is defined as a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month for over three months, with migraine features present on at least 8 of those days. The International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for migraine require only two of four commonly seen pain features; thus, a non-throbbing, bilateral headache can still meet migraine criteria if it is moderate to severe, worsens with physical activity, and is accompanied by migraine-specific symptoms. Neck pain related to stress, which is sometimes associated with tension-type headache, is also a common feature of migraine. Measurements play a crucial role in scientific research across various fields, including natural sciences, social sciences, and health sciences. In the biomedical sciences, many clinical conditions, psychological behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs are challenging to measure accurately. These may include disease severity, disease-related quality of life, pain perception, anxiety, and more. To quantify and assess specific attributes, researchers develop tools known as ""scales"" that consist of various components. Clinical scales are tools used in medicine to evaluate different aspects of a patient's health, including physical and mental health symptoms, functional abilities, and overall quality of life. The Headache Needs Assessment (HANA) is designed to assess two dimensions of the chronic impact of migraine-related quality of life issues: frequency and discomfort. It comprises seven items and serves as a useful screening tool for evaluating the impact of migraine on individuals. Its two-dimensional approach to patient-reported quality of life enables individuals to weigh the influence of both the frequency and discomfort of chronic migraines on various aspects of daily life. This scale will fill a gap in the Turkish literature regarding the parameters it evaluates and will serve as a valuable tool in the field. Inclusion Criteria: * Having a diagnosis of chronic migraine (headaches occurring on more than 15 days per month for over three months, with migraine headaches on at least eight days per month), * Being between 18 and 65 years of age, * Experiencing neck pain during migraine attacks. Exclusion Criteria: * Having a diagnosis of any headache disorder other than chronic migraine, * Having a history of any systemic disease, such as malignancy, inflammatory conditions, acute fractures, surgical history, neurological, psychological, or rheumatological disorders."

Specific aims are to:

AIM 1: evaluate the efficacy of QUIT4EVER on rates of abstinence from cigarettes (assessed with multiple measures including bioverified abstinence) during short and long term abstinence (measured at 3 and 6 months).

Hypothesis 1: QUIT4EVER will be associated with increased long term abstinence (self-reported and bio-verified prolonged abstinence at the 3 and 6 month follow-up).

AIM 2: assess the impact of QUIT4EVER on counseling treatment completion and medication adherence.

San Francisco Department of Public Health,OTHER_GOV,NCT04614584,Mirtazapine and Methamphetamine Drug-drug Interaction Study,Phase 1 Safety-interaction Study of Mirtazapine for the Treatment of Methamphetamine Use Disorder,"This is a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of mirtazapine for methamphetamine (MA) use disorder (MUD) to ensure the safety of this medication in the presence of a relevant dose of MA for people actively-using MA.

Aim 1: To determine if mirtazapine alters the cardiovascular response to IV MA.

Aim 2: To determine if the pharmacokinetics of IV MA are altered by mirtazapine administration.

Aim 3: To evaluate the above aims in the setting of concomitant administration of methadone.

This study involves two simultaneous within-subject drug-drug interaction studies, each comprised of 12 participants. A total of 24 subjects will be enrolled who have methamphetamine use disorder who will be classified into 2 groups: (Group 1: no opioids; Group 2: opioid use disorder on methadone maintenance). Subjects will be randomized to the order of mirtazapine and placebo (i.e. one-half will receive mirtazapine first, then placebo; one-half will receive placebo first, then mirtazapine).","This is a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of mirtazapine for methamphetamine (MA) use disorder (MUD) to ensure the safety of this medication in the presence of a relevant dose of MA for people actively-using MA. MA is a widely used psychostimulant associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. MA is more prevalent than many other drugs, including opioids, with 37 million users of MA and amphetamine worldwide and 1.4 million past-year users in the U.S. alone in 2016. The number of MA poisoning deaths has steadily risen in recent years, from \>3,700 in 2014 to 10,333 in 2017. Importantly, MA has been recognized as contributing substantially to the U.S. opioid crisis, with about half of MA poisoning deaths also caused by opioids. In the U.S., the annual economic cost of MA use is estimated to be $23.4 billion and use is strongly associated with HIV transmission.

There are no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for MUD, a major gap in addiction medicine, especially because behavioral interventions alone have limited efficacy and would likely benefit from adjunctive pharmacologic therapy. Investigators' prior clinical trials included a Phase IIa trial (N=60) and a replication Phase IIb trial (N=120) demonstrating that mirtazapine (an adrenergic, serotoninergic, and dopaminergic generic medication currently approved to treat depression) 30mg orally once daily reduced MA use among MA-dependent men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women. Investigators were directed to conduct a DDI study to ensure the safety of mirtazapine with MA. This research is particularly relevant given the overlap of MA use disorder and opioid use disorder (OUD), which could raise additional safety concerns.

The primary objectives of this study are as follows:

1. To determine if mirtazapine 30mg daily alters the cardiovascular response to IV MA. The interaction of active medication (compared with placebo) with relevant doses of MA (30 mg) on cardiovascular (heart rate, blood pressure, QTc interval) parameters and adverse events, including serotonergic signs, will be assessed to gather safety information in the Phase I human laboratory.
2. To determine if mirtazapine alters the pharmacokinetics of IV MA. Pharmacokinetic parameters for MA and its major metabolites will be assessed over 48 hours under steady state mirtazapine (30 mg) or placebo, and relevant IV MA challenge (30 mg).
3. To evaluate the above aims in the setting of concomitant steady-state administration of morphine or methadone.

Design This study involves two simultaneous within-subject drug-drug interaction studies, each comprised of 12 participants. A total of 24 subjects will be enrolled who have MA use disorder who will be classified into 2 groups: (Group 1: no opioids; Group 2: opioid use disorder on methadone maintenance). Subjects will be randomized to the order of mirtazapine and placebo (i.e. one-half will receive mirtazapine first, then placebo; one-half will receive placebo first, then mirtazapine).

Procedures Screening assessments will be completed across two-to-four visits over 2 weeks. All screening assessments should be completed within 14 days after labs are drawn.

All subjects will complete the following study visits: screening 1 and 2, enrollment/admission to inpatient stay, 14-day inpatient stay, 14-day post-discharge follow-up visit.

After consent is obtained, eligibility will be determined over the following screening visits, including medical history and physical examination (including weight and height), review of systems, vital signs, concomitant medications, EKG, breathalyzer, labwork, SCID. Additional assessments will include the CDS-12, PSQI, TLFB for substance use, delayed discounting, BIS-11, Stroop Test, CUDIT-r, COWS, ACSA, BDI-II.

On the day of enrollment, study staff will confirm eligibility and transport patient to hospital for admission. Participant will receive a test infusion of MA 30mg IV. If participant tolerates test infusion within defined parameters, participant will be formally enrolled and randomized. First dose of study drug will be administered the evening of admission. On the fifth hospital day, participant will undergo MA challenge (single-blind placebo and 30mg IV for subjective, cardiovascular, and PK assessments). PK draws will continue for 48 hours after infusion.

Participant will begin the opposite condition on day 8 and complete the MA infusion procedures on day 12. After completion of PK studies on day 14, participant will be discharged.

A post-discharge safety check will be completed 10 days after discharge (+/- 7 days).","Inclusion Criteria:

Aim 1: To determine if mirtazapine alters the cardiovascular response to IV MA. Aim 2: To determine if the pharmacokinetics of IV MA are altered by mirtazapine administration. Aim 3: To evaluate the above aims in the setting of concomitant administration of methadone. This study involves two simultaneous within-subject drug-drug interaction studies, each comprised of 12 participants. A total of 24 subjects will be enrolled who have methamphetamine use disorder who will be classified into 2 groups: (Group 1: no opioids; Group 2: opioid use disorder on methadone maintenance). Subjects will be randomized to the order of mirtazapine and placebo (i.e. one-half will receive mirtazapine first, then placebo; one-half will receive placebo first, then mirtazapine). This is a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study of mirtazapine for methamphetamine (MA) use disorder (MUD) to ensure the safety of this medication in the presence of a relevant dose of MA for people actively-using MA. MA is a widely used psychostimulant associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. MA is more prevalent than many other drugs, including opioids, with 37 million users of MA and amphetamine worldwide and 1.4 million past-year users in the U.S. alone in 2016. The number of MA poisoning deaths has steadily risen in recent years, from \>3,700 in 2014 to 10,333 in 2017. Importantly, MA has been recognized as contributing substantially to the U.S. opioid crisis, with about half of MA poisoning deaths also caused by opioids. In the U.S., the annual economic cost of MA use is estimated to be $23.4 billion and use is strongly associated with HIV transmission. There are no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for MUD, a major gap in addiction medicine, especially because behavioral interventions alone have limited efficacy and would likely benefit from adjunctive pharmacologic therapy. Investigators' prior clinical trials included a Phase IIa trial (N=60) and a replication Phase IIb trial (N=120) demonstrating that mirtazapine (an adrenergic, serotoninergic, and dopaminergic generic medication currently approved to treat depression) 30mg orally once daily reduced MA use among MA-dependent men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women. Investigators were directed to conduct a DDI study to ensure the safety of mirtazapine with MA. This research is particularly relevant given the overlap of MA use disorder and opioid use disorder (OUD), which could raise additional safety concerns. The primary objectives of this study are as follows: 1. To determine if mirtazapine 30mg daily alters the cardiovascular response to IV MA. The interaction of active medication (compared with placebo) with relevant doses of MA (30 mg) on cardiovascular (heart rate, blood pressure, QTc interval) parameters and adverse events, including serotonergic signs, will be assessed to gather safety information in the Phase I human laboratory. 2. To determine if mirtazapine alters the pharmacokinetics of IV MA. Pharmacokinetic parameters for MA and its major metabolites will be assessed over 48 hours under steady state mirtazapine (30 mg) or placebo, and relevant IV MA challenge (30 mg). 3. To evaluate the above aims in the setting of concomitant steady-state administration of morphine or methadone. Design This study involves two simultaneous within-subject drug-drug interaction studies, each comprised of 12 participants. A total of 24 subjects will be enrolled who have MA use disorder who will be classified into 2 groups: (Group 1: no opioids; Group 2: opioid use disorder on methadone maintenance). Subjects will be randomized to the order of mirtazapine and placebo (i.e. one-half will receive mirtazapine first, then placebo; one-half will receive placebo first, then mirtazapine). Procedures Screening assessments will be completed across two-to-four visits over 2 weeks. All screening assessments should be completed within 14 days after labs are drawn. All subjects will complete the following study visits: screening 1 and 2, enrollment/admission to inpatient stay, 14-day inpatient stay, 14-day post-discharge follow-up visit. After consent is obtained, eligibility will be determined over the following screening visits, including medical history and physical examination (including weight and height), review of systems, vital signs, concomitant medications, EKG, breathalyzer, labwork, SCID. Additional assessments will include the CDS-12, PSQI, TLFB for substance use, delayed discounting, BIS-11, Stroop Test, CUDIT-r, COWS, ACSA, BDI-II. On the day of enrollment, study staff will confirm eligibility and transport patient to hospital for admission. Participant will receive a test infusion of MA 30mg IV. If participant tolerates test infusion within defined parameters, participant will be formally enrolled and randomized. First dose of study drug will be administered the evening of admission. On the fifth hospital day, participant will undergo MA challenge (single-blind placebo and 30mg IV for subjective, cardiovascular, and PK assessments). PK draws will continue for 48 hours after infusion. Participant will begin the opposite condition on day 8 and complete the MA infusion procedures on day 12. After completion of PK studies on day 14, participant will be discharged. A post-discharge safety check will be completed 10 days after discharge (+/- 7 days). Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Is it Necessary?,"Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a very common complication of cholelithiasis, encountered in 20% of symptomatic patients.

Nowadays laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the standard treatment in mild and moderates forms of diseases and antibiotic therapy in the postoperatory of these patients remains under discussion. However in the beginning, AC presents itself as an steril process, the obstruction of the cystic duct initiates a cascade of inflammation, ischaemia and necrosis, as well as bacterial proliferation within the gallbladder lumen. Bactibilia was a significant factor associated with total, as well as infectious, operative complications. Regarding this, for some authors, monotherapy with amoxicillin clavulanic (AMC) would be the best treatment after LC in patients with mild and moderate cholecystitis without intraoperative complications such as bile peritonitis, cholangitis, gallbladder perforation or abscess. In the other hand, others do not prescribe antimicrobial treatment after surgery in these selected patients.

There is controversy regarding the postoperative treatment with antibiotics in patients with mild and moderate cholecystitis and all the evidence about this topic.

Therefore, investigators decided to conduct a prospective randomized study in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute mild and moderate cholecystitis cancer. The patients will be randomized to receive AMC or placebo after surgery. With this study investigators intend to prove that are no clinical differences in postoperative outcomes between patients treated with AMC and placebo.

Is it Necessary? Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a very common complication of cholelithiasis, encountered in 20% of symptomatic patients. Nowadays laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the standard treatment in mild and moderates forms of diseases and antibiotic therapy in the postoperatory of these patients remains under discussion. However in the beginning, AC presents itself as an steril process, the obstruction of the cystic duct initiates a cascade of inflammation, ischaemia and necrosis, as well as bacterial proliferation within the gallbladder lumen. Bactibilia was a significant factor associated with total, as well as infectious, operative complications. Regarding this, for some authors, monotherapy with amoxicillin clavulanic (AMC) would be the best treatment after LC in patients with mild and moderate cholecystitis without intraoperative complications such as bile peritonitis, cholangitis, gallbladder perforation or abscess. In the other hand, others do not prescribe antimicrobial treatment after surgery in these selected patients. There is controversy regarding the postoperative treatment with antibiotics in patients with mild and moderate cholecystitis and all the evidence about this topic. Therefore, investigators decided to conduct a prospective randomized study in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute mild and moderate cholecystitis cancer. The patients will be randomized to receive AMC or placebo after surgery. With this study investigators intend to prove that are no clinical differences in postoperative outcomes between patients treated with AMC and placebo. The primary aim of the trial is to assess that there are no benefits in the use of postoperative antibiotics in patients whit mild or moderate acute cholecystitis in whom a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed.

US Department of Veterans Affairs,FED,NCT00333879,Virtual Reality Mobility Training System for Veterans With Vision Loss,Virtual Reality Mobility Training System for Veterans With Vision Loss,"This is a two-year proof-of-concept study to evaluate a new Virtual Reality (VR) ""holographic"" sound system for use as an audiological Orientation and Mobility (O\&M) training tool","This is a two-year proof-of-concept study to evaluate a new Virtual Reality (VR) ""holographic"" sound system for use as an audiological Orientation and Mobility (O\&M) training tool. This new system avoids the limitations of other technologies (i.e., binaural recordings and existing VR sound systems) that have been employed with limited success for audiological training. Four advancements in the state-of-the-art represented by this new holographic system provide new promise for audiological O\&M training. First, unlike binaural systems, the new system allows the person to move their head in a natural fashion to localize sounds. Second, a spherical microphone array is used to record sound environments so as to retain the direction from which each ambient sound originated. When these recorded sound environments are later presented through head-tracking headphones in a VR environment, real-time software maintains the directionality of the sound so that it remains true no matter how the person moves or turns their head. Third, this new system models the actual physical acoustic structure of each person's head and ears to present sounds as they would be heard by that particular person in the recorded setting. Fourth, this system uses software algorithms to isolate specific sounds (i.e., of a moving vehicle) so that during virtual playback, these sounds can be inserted into the virtual sound field at will and in a customizable fashion to create truly unique and flexible virtual sound presentations.

There are two study hypotheses. First, when using sounds to negotiate traffic intersections, skills employed by experienced travelers in real environments will readily transfer to the proposed VR environment to the extent that audiological tasks performed in real environments are just as easily performed in the VR environment. Second, when the VR environment is enhanced to emphasize critical sound cues and eliminate distracting or confusing noises and sounds, performance by skilled travelers in the VR environment will be significantly better than in the actual environment.

The objectives are to: (1) adapt the existing spherical microphone array and digital recording software algorithms to best suit the capture of critical intersection sounds used for intersection negotiations; (2) develop software algorithms to deconstruct intersection sounds, isolating each sound for the VR construction of specific environments of varying complexity; (3) determine the level of sound detail necessary for negotiating intersections successfully; (4) expand the existing system to obtain the desired level of detail; (5) develop software to provide the ability to control the relative emphasis of a variety of sound elements being presented so as to simplify the auditory task; and (6) employ study participants to compare performance in the VR environment with outdoor performance.

Once validated, this system should be able to: (1) leverage instructor time by providing students with an effective means of practicing audiological skills on their own, (2) provide instructors with a means of introducing concepts in a graduated learning sequence that is not dependent on the happenstance availability of specific sounds and conditions found in real environments, and (3) provide audiological training for environments not located in the vicinity of the training site, but which do represent the veteran's home community.

Research will be conducted in collaboration with investigators in the Perceptual Interfaces and Reality Laboratory (PIRL) at the University of Maryland who initially conceived and developed this holographic VR sound system.

Second, a spherical microphone array is used to record sound environments so as to retain the direction from which each ambient sound originated. When these recorded sound environments are later presented through head-tracking headphones in a VR environment, real-time software maintains the directionality of the sound so that it remains true no matter how the person moves or turns their head. Third, this new system models the actual physical acoustic structure of each person's head and ears to present sounds as they would be heard by that particular person in the recorded setting. Fourth, this system uses software algorithms to isolate specific sounds (i.e., of a moving vehicle) so that during virtual playback, these sounds can be inserted into the virtual sound field at will and in a customizable fashion to create truly unique and flexible virtual sound presentations. There are two study hypotheses. First, when using sounds to negotiate traffic intersections, skills employed by experienced travelers in real environments will readily transfer to the proposed VR environment to the extent that audiological tasks performed in real environments are just as easily performed in the VR environment. Second, when the VR environment is enhanced to emphasize critical sound cues and eliminate distracting or confusing noises and sounds, performance by skilled travelers in the VR environment will be significantly better than in the actual environment. The objectives are to: (1) adapt the existing spherical microphone array and digital recording software algorithms to best suit the capture of critical intersection sounds used for intersection negotiations; (2) develop software algorithms to deconstruct intersection sounds, isolating each sound for the VR construction of specific environments of varying complexity; (3) determine the level of sound detail necessary for negotiating intersections successfully; (4) expand the existing system to obtain the desired level of detail; (5) develop software to provide the ability to control the relative emphasis of a variety of sound elements being presented so as to simplify the auditory task; and (6) employ study participants to compare performance in the VR environment with outdoor performance. Once validated, this system should be able to: (1) leverage instructor time by providing students with an effective means of practicing audiological skills on their own, (2) provide instructors with a means of introducing concepts in a graduated learning sequence that is not dependent on the happenstance availability of specific sounds and conditions found in real environments, and (3) provide audiological training for environments not located in the vicinity of the training site, but which do represent the veteran's home community. Research will be conducted in collaboration with investigators in the Perceptual Interfaces and Reality Laboratory (PIRL) at the University of Maryland who initially conceived and developed this holographic VR sound system.

Although several evidence-based treatments of adolescent substance abuse are emerging, none have experienced widespread adoption in community settings. Thus, as noted by the Institute of Medicine (1998) more than a decade ago and reiterated more recently, a considerable science-service gap exists in regards to treatment of substance abuse in adolescents and adults.

For the proposed study, 204 adolescents meeting diagnostic criteria for substance abuse or dependence will be randomized to either the Contingency Management-Family Engagement (CM-FAM) or Treatment as Usual (TAU) conditions. A multimethod, multirespondent approach will be used to track clinical outcomes at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months post recruitment. Clinical level outcomes pertain to youth substance use, criminal behavior, mental health functioning, and key mediators of serious antisocial behavior in adolescents (e.g., self-control, parental supervision, association with deviant peers). In addition, the incremental cost of CM-FAM will be determined for use in cost effectiveness analyses.

Aim 1: Over an 18-month post-recruitment follow-up, determine the relative effectiveness of CM-FAM vs. TAU in reducing adolescent participants' substance use, criminal activity (including incarceration), and mental health symptoms; and evaluate the cost effectiveness of CM-FAM in achieving these outcomes.

Aim 2: Examine possible moderators and mediators of intervention effectiveness. Moderator variables will include youth demographic and clinical (e.g., co-occurring disorders) characteristics.

M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,OTHER,NCT00075179,Natrecor in Pulmonary Hypertension,"Phase IV, Open Labeled Study to Test the Effectiveness of Nesiritide in Reversing Pulmonary Hypertension in Patients Who Will be Undergoing CardioThoracic Surgery","The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the drug nesiritide (Natrecor) is effective in lowering the pressure in your lungs.

The primary objective of this study is to establish that Nesiritide (Natrecor) is effective in reducing pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) acutely as measured by a 20% reduction in the mean pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure. The secondary objectives will include: improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, frequency of toxicity, and surgeon's willingness to proceed with operation.","Patients with high pressure in their lungs often have many symptoms such as, shortness of breath, low energy, and fatigue. Decreasing the pressure in the lungs may help these patients feel better. The drug nesiritide was designed to help treat heart failure, however, it may also help to decrease the pressure in the lungs.

Before treatment, you will be asked questions about your medical history and about any medications you are currently taking. You will have a focused physical exam. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart). You will have an ultrasound on your heart called an echocardiogram to measure the pressures in your lungs and your ability to breathe will be evaluated. With the aid of the research nurse, you will have a 6-minute walk test if you are able. You may stop or sit down at any time during the test. This test is being done to evaluate your energy level. You will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about your symptoms. This questionnaire will take no longer than 10 minutes to complete.

In order to measure the pressure in your lungs, you will have a procedure called a ""right heart catheterization"". This is a procedure that may have been done as part of your standard of care if you were not enrolled in this study. For this procedure, a small tube will be placed in a vein in your neck. A longer tube will be inserted into the first tube and fed through the vein and into your heart. This tube will be used to measure the pressure in your heart and lungs. If the pressure in your lungs is above a certain level, you will receive treatment with nesiritide during the right heart catheterization procedure. Nesiritide will be given by vein over 30 minutes. After treatment, the pressure in your heart and lungs will be measured again. You will be awake during this procedure and lying flat on your back.

The primary objective of this study is to establish that Nesiritide (Natrecor) is effective in reducing pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) acutely as measured by a 20% reduction in the mean pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure. The secondary objectives will include: improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, frequency of toxicity, and surgeon's willingness to proceed with operation. Patients with high pressure in their lungs often have many symptoms such as, shortness of breath, low energy, and fatigue. Decreasing the pressure in the lungs may help these patients feel better. The drug nesiritide was designed to help treat heart failure, however, it may also help to decrease the pressure in the lungs. Before treatment, you will be asked questions about your medical history and about any medications you are currently taking. You will have a focused physical exam. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart). You will have an ultrasound on your heart called an echocardiogram to measure the pressures in your lungs and your ability to breathe will be evaluated. With the aid of the research nurse, you will have a 6-minute walk test if you are able. You may stop or sit down at any time during the test. This test is being done to evaluate your energy level. You will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about your symptoms. This questionnaire will take no longer than 10 minutes to complete. In order to measure the pressure in your lungs, you will have a procedure called a ""right heart catheterization"". This is a procedure that may have been done as part of your standard of care if you were not enrolled in this study. For this procedure, a small tube will be placed in a vein in your neck. A longer tube will be inserted into the first tube and fed through the vein and into your heart. This tube will be used to measure the pressure in your heart and lungs. If the pressure in your lungs is above a certain level, you will receive treatment with nesiritide during the right heart catheterization procedure. Nesiritide will be given by vein over 30 minutes. After treatment, the pressure in your heart and lungs will be measured again. You will be awake during this procedure and lying flat on your back. An anesthetic will be used to numb the area of your neck where the tube is placed. The entire procedure (including treatment) should take no longer than 2 hours.

National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),NIH,NCT00012584,Treatment of Youth With ADHD and Anxiety,A Treatment Study of Youth With Comorbid Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Anxiety Disorders,"The purpose of this NIMH-sponsored pilot study is to collect information on the efficacy and safety of drug treatments for children and adolescents who suffer from both ADHD and anxiety disorders. Specifically, the study will examine the benefits of the stimulant medication both alone and in combination with fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has antianxiety effects. Young people aged 6 to 17 diagnosed with these co-occurring disorders may be eligible to participate.","Many children and adolescents with mental disorders in the United States are treated with multiple psychotropic medications even though there is not much information on how well these medications work together or if they are safe to administer together. Many youth with ADHD have co-occurring (comorbid) disorders such as oppositional-defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. There is much interest in the treatment of children and adolescents with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorders because this is a common condition in clinical practice. When children with both anxiety and ADHD receive stimulant medication for ADHD, their anxiety may not improve. SSRI medications represent a reasonable addition to stimulant treatment, as they are considered effective for anxiety disorders based on controlled trials in adults and open trials in children. However, there are no data from controlled studies regarding the tolerability and dosing of the combination of stimulant treatment (including methylphenidate) and SSRIs in the treatment of children with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorder.

In this study, children and adolescents will be evaluated for the presence of both ADHD and Anxiety Disorder. Approximately 120 children and adolescents with both disorders who meet all the study entry requirements (such as being otherwise medically healthy) will be enrolled. Children and adolescents who are not on a stable dose of a stimulant will first be treated openly with methylphenidate for 6 weeks. Those whose ADHD does not improve during this initial treatment period will not continue in the study but will be referred for further support in the community. Those who show improvement in both their ADHD and anxiety symptoms will stay on methylphenidate for an additional 8 weeks. Those who show improvement in ADHD but not anxiety will be asked to enter the double-blind phase of the study. In this phase, participants will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive either fluvoxamine or placebo, in combination with stimulant/methylphenidate, for 8 weeks. Children or adolescents who enter the study on a stable dose of stimulant will move directly to the Double-Blind phase. Participants who are assigned to placebo and who do not show an improvement in anxiety after 8 weeks will be eligible for an additional 8 weeks of open treatment with the methylphenidate/stimulant and fluvoxamine combination. At the end of the trial, clinical care will be provided for up to an additional month until referral to an outside clinician can be arranged.","* ADHD diagnosis

Specifically, the study will examine the benefits of the stimulant medication both alone and in combination with fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has antianxiety effects. Young people aged 6 to 17 diagnosed with these co-occurring disorders may be eligible to participate. Many children and adolescents with mental disorders in the United States are treated with multiple psychotropic medications even though there is not much information on how well these medications work together or if they are safe to administer together. Many youth with ADHD have co-occurring (comorbid) disorders such as oppositional-defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. There is much interest in the treatment of children and adolescents with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorders because this is a common condition in clinical practice. When children with both anxiety and ADHD receive stimulant medication for ADHD, their anxiety may not improve. SSRI medications represent a reasonable addition to stimulant treatment, as they are considered effective for anxiety disorders based on controlled trials in adults and open trials in children. However, there are no data from controlled studies regarding the tolerability and dosing of the combination of stimulant treatment (including methylphenidate) and SSRIs in the treatment of children with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorder. In this study, children and adolescents will be evaluated for the presence of both ADHD and Anxiety Disorder. Approximately 120 children and adolescents with both disorders who meet all the study entry requirements (such as being otherwise medically healthy) will be enrolled. Children and adolescents who are not on a stable dose of a stimulant will first be treated openly with methylphenidate for 6 weeks. Those whose ADHD does not improve during this initial treatment period will not continue in the study but will be referred for further support in the community. Those who show improvement in both their ADHD and anxiety symptoms will stay on methylphenidate for an additional 8 weeks. Those who show improvement in ADHD but not anxiety will be asked to enter the double-blind phase of the study. In this phase, participants will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive either fluvoxamine or placebo, in combination with stimulant/methylphenidate, for 8 weeks. Children or adolescents who enter the study on a stable dose of stimulant will move directly to the Double-Blind phase. Participants who are assigned to placebo and who do not show an improvement in anxiety after 8 weeks will be eligible for an additional 8 weeks of open treatment with the methylphenidate/stimulant and fluvoxamine combination. At the end of the trial, clinical care will be provided for up to an additional month until referral to an outside clinician can be arranged. * ADHD diagnosis * DSM-IV diagnosis of anxiety * IQ greater than 70 * residence with primary caretaker for at least 6 months * ages 6-17 and attending school * no previous treatment failure to or intolerance of fluvoxamine or methylphenidate (unless currently taking another stimulant)"
Zealand University Hospital,OTHER,NCT04248179,The Ultrasound-guided Multiple-injection Costotransverse Block for Mastectomy and Primary Reconstructive Surgery.,"The Ultrasound-guided Multiple-injection Costotransverse Block for Mastectomy and Primary Reconstructive Surgery. A Double Blind, Randomised, Placebo Controlled Trial.","The investigators have developed a novel ultrasound-guided nerve block indicated primarily for breast cancer surgery that mimic a thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) - hitherto the internationally accepted regional anesthesia golden standard for anesthesia of the hemithorax - but hypothetically without the risks of adverse events associated with the TPVB (i.e. pneumothorax, risk of bleeding in the thoracic paravertebral space, random and unmanageable epidural spread etc.). The investigators have already tested the anatomical- and block execution hypothesis in a randomized cadaveric study, and the investigators now have anatomical proof of concept for the functionality of the block technique. The investigators have also conducted a small clinical pilot study with very promising results. The investigators wish to conduct a randomized, placebo controlled and double-blind study, comparing the effect of the ultrasound-guided multiple-injection costotransverse block (MICB) vs. placebo. The aim with this study is to investigate the efficacy of the MICB vs. placebo in patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy and primary reconstructive surgery due to breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. The hypothesis is, that the unilateral MICB will significantly reduce the opioid consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours and significantly reduce the Numerical Rating Scale pain score (0-10) and opioid related side effects.","Twelve women in Denmark are diagnosed with breast cancer every day. Breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are the primary type of cancer/precursor to cancer in women, and one of the main treatment modalities is surgical intervention. DCIS is a non-invasive (pre-malignant) condition in the breast with proliferating cells with malignant characteristics; confined in situ by the basal lamina in the breast. International DCIS is considered as manifest breast cancer, but in Denmark DCIS is considered as a precursor to breast cancer.

Breast cancer and DCIS surgery includes many subtypes ranging from the minor lumpectomy to major surgery; e.g. mastectomy and reconstructive surgery with or without axillary clearance. All surgical subtypes at the Department of Plastic Surgery and Breast Surgery, Zealand University Hospital (ZUH) are performed under general anesthesia (GA) and implies a multimodal pain regimen with preoperative oral medication (Paracetamol 1g, Celecoxib (NSAIDs) 400mg, Gabapentin 600mg, Dexamethasone 8mg and Dextromethorphan 30mg). Standard GA is total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and consists of Remifentanil, Propofol (and Rocuronium for tracheal intubation if needed), and the anesthesiologists will administer IV Sufentanil (a synthetic long-lasting opioid) 0.3-0.5 microg/kg 20-30 minutes prior to emergence for the immediate postoperative pain treatment. The patients are given additional Sufentanil and/or morphine intravenously in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), if necessary.

Depending of surgical subtype, the surgeons will sometimes inject local anesthetic (LA) during surgery. The anesthesiologists will infrequently (depending on the availability of technical skills on the day of surgery) perform ultrasound-guided (USG) nerve blocks (Pecs 1 (and or) 2 and serratus anterior blocks) in the anterolateral thoracic wall prior to surgery, but this is not an implemented standard treatment. It is sadly neither national nor European standard to use USG nerve blocks for perioperative pain management for breast cancer and DCIS surgery. Instead, the vast majority of surgical centers rely heavily on the use of various long-lasting opioids, despite the adverse events associated with these drugs. Only relatively few surgical centers in Europe have implemented TPVB or other USG nerve blocks in the anterior thoracic wall as standard treatment for perioperative pain management.

USG multiple-injection TPVB is considered the regional anesthesia golden standard for breast cancer and DCIS surgery and reduces both acute and chronic pain as well as postoperative opioid consumption.

To determine which surgical subtype would be the most relevant to investigate (define the quantity of the research problem) the research group at ZUH have conducted a thorough retrospective study (including 111 patients) regarding postoperative pain and 12- and 24-hrs opioid consumption concerning patients undergoing breast cancer and DCIS surgery during 2016-2017 at the Department of Plastic Surgery and Breast Surgery, ZUH. The electronic anesthesia files, PACU files and ward files were meticulously reviewed. Six surgical subgroups were reviewed and the UMPR surgery elicited high values on the numeric rating scale (NRS) and a substantial need for perioperative opioids. The survey revealed an overall accumulated morphine consumption in the first 24 postoperative hours of 86.1±60.1mg (mean ± SD) of oral morphine equivalents (OME) and a NRS in the PACU of 4.5±2.4 (mean ± SD) in UMPR patients - and this surgical subtype was selected as most relevant and feasible to investigate. This dosage should be evaluated in relation to the standardized multimodal regimen described above.

There is definitely room for improvement in regards to the current treatment of this patient group. For instance, sub-group analysis reveals that patients having only received our current USG blocks (+preoperative oral medication and GA) have an accumulated morphine consumption in the first 24 postoperative hours of 81±55.2mg (mean ± SD) of OME.

Indication for UMPR surgery is either breast cancer or DCIS. UMPR surgery can be performed in several stages (and with several techniques) involving multiple GA techniques. However, at ZUH one-stage UMPR surgery is common and is described in the following (multiple stage surgery is irrelevant for the study protocol).

Standard operating procedure for one-stage UMPR surgery often involves two surgeons; i.e. one breast surgeon performing the mastectomy and one plastic surgeon performing the subsequent reconstructive surgery.

The mastectomy is skin conserving with incision inferolateral to the breast tissue. The breast tissue is removed leaving a pocket. The area profound to the major pectoral muscle and superficial to the minor pectoral muscle is opened and prepared for a prothesis. Very common this prothesis is an expander-prothesis with a filling-chamber (for subsequent ambulant re-fillings). An expander-prothesis is either permanent or temporary. If permanent the filling-chamber is removed ambulant with LA, if temporary the prothesis is removed in toto under GA and replaced with a permanent prothesis. Two surgical drains are installed; one in the pocket between the major pectoral muscle and the skin and one between the major pectoral muscle and the minor pectoral muscle (beside the prothesis). The drains exit the skin in the lateral thoracic wall without an exact defined anatomical point but often it is in the front axillary line below the incision.

The UMPR patient is evaluated by the operating surgeon around 14 days after surgery where the pathology results are reviewed.

Side effects of the current anesthesiologic practice/treatment. The use of morphine (IV and oral) can cause severe side effects, including nausea and vomiting, bowl paralysis, urine retention, sleep disturbances and respiratory depression. These side effects can delay mobilization after surgery, increase the risk of complications and worst of all be fatal.

In addition to all the well-known adverse events associated with morphine and the synthetic opioid derivate, these drugs have several masked adverse events (e.g. immunomodulation, hormonal disturbing, delirium triggering, angiogenetic etc.). Despite numerous (retrospective) studies regarding these issues, it is not yet possible to definitively link morphine consumption to metastasis formation and subsequent cancer recurrence. However, the surgical stress during the surgical procedures possibly generates an advantageous environment for dissemination of tumor cells when these inevitably are released to the blood stream by surgery. Studies advocate that TPVB reduces the perioperative opioid consumption - an indication of reduced surgical stress and other studies indicate that TPVB might even decrease the metastasis and progression of breast cancer. Large prospective studies regarding breast cancer recurrence with TPVB (and thoracic epidurals) are still ongoing.

Chronic postoperative pain Chronic postoperative pain (CPP) is a significant and very common problem associated to breast cancer and DCIS surgery ranging between 20-65% in all patients. Moderate to severe pain is reported to be between 10-20%. The underlying etiology is multifactorial and not fully understood, but it is suggested that CPP is occurring from a perioperative sensitization of the central nervous system. Numerous studies suggest that TPVB might decrease CPP and it has been postulated that the effect is due to an efficient treatment of acute pain leading to a decreased sensitization (both peripheral and central sensory) and a lower incidence of CPP.

A new prospective observational study finds that severity of acute pain is associated with the development of persistent pain.

The new block. The breast is innervated by the lateral and medial pectoral nerves from the brachial plexus and the T2-T6 thoracic spinal nerves. Hence, no regional technique will block the entire hemithorax with a single injection. The relatively new USG nerve blocks in the anterior thoracic wall like the ""pecs block"" and serratus anterior plane block, do not target the same nerves as TPVB.

The TPVB is executed in the posterior thoracic wall near the vertebral bodies with the needle tip just adjacent to the pleura and thereby with an inherent risk of pneumothorax as well as other serious adverse events. In expert hands and with ultrasound guidance the risk is probably relatively low. However, many anesthesiologists are still reluctant to perform the block due to the perceived risks.

Recently, the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) emerged and quickly gained a lot of attention for various indications. The ESPB have only been used for breast cancer surgery in a few case studies and in one RCT but presumably with some success.

The investigators have modified the ESPB to a novel multiple-injection costotransverse block (MICB). MICB is also a USG nerve block in the posterior thoracic wall. With MICB, the investigators inject LA on the superficial side of the superior costotransverse ligament (SCTL); which is the posterior border of the thoracic paravertebral space (TPVS). The LA will spread from the injection point and into the TPVS via the costotransverse foramen and the veins traversing the SCTL. Thereby the investigators mimic a TPVB, but - very important - with the needle tip in a very comfortable distance to the pleura reducing the risk of adverse events. The investigators have already proved this in a large cadaveric study with multinational collaboration. In this study, the MICB effectively stained the ventral rami, the communicating rami and the thoracic sympathetic trunk. Epidural spread was completely absent with the MICB.

The investigators have published two abstracts concerning this new block modality - and the main article is published in Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica.

Pilot studies show that the MICB is considered a PNB with very little discomfort for the patient (NRS 1-2) ""as painful as having a standard IV line in the hand"" - which aligns with a previous study performed in our department regarding a deep nerve block for analgesia of the abdominal wall.

As the end-point for the MICB is the analgesic effect of a TPVB the investigators find it relevant to describe the contraindications to TPVB.

In general, there are few contraindications to TPVB. However, infection at the site of needle insertion, empyema, allergy to local anesthetic drugs, patient refusal and tumor occupying the TPVS are the most common noted contraindications in the literature. Before the emergence of ultrasound for nerve block execution coagulopathy, bleeding disorder or therapeutic anticoagulation were considered as relative contraindications for TPVB. Today, with ultrasound guidance there are no firm consensus on relative contraindications regarding especially therapeutic anticoagulation when performing TPVB.

Every day the investigators perform deep truncal blocks at the department at ZUH and the investigators have yet to see bleeding as a complication. The MICB is NOT a neuraxial block, neither do the investigators consider it a deep block. The mere purpose of the MICB is to further reduce the already low incidence of complications with TPVB. Recently, one accidental pneumothorax (with TPVB) was reported in well over 2000 patients, but not a single bleeding complication was reported and another study with 1427 TPVBs only six complications was reported (no bleeding); all handled successfully.

The investigators generally consider the MICB (and other paravertebral blocks by proxy) as safe procedures.","Inclusion Criteria:

Jewish Home & Hospital Lifecare System,OTHER,NCT02994979,Nursing Assistant Intervention to Prevent Delirium in Nursing Homes,Multicomponent Intervention to Prevent Delirium in Nursing Homes,"Delirium is an acute confusion that occurs in one third of hospitalized older adults. As compared to those without delirium, hospitalized patients with delirium have longer hospital stays, higher mortality, and increased risk of nursing home utilization. Substantial attention has been paid to developing, testing, and disseminating interventions to prevent delirium in the hospital but, to date, not in the nursing home setting. In a previous study we used known information on delirium risk factors to develop an intervention that can be delivered at onset of acute illness in nursing home patients. The current study is designed to test the effect of this intervention in a single-site clinical trial. Objectives: 1) to determine, as compared to control, the effect of a multicomponent intervention targeting delirium risk factors on delirium frequency, delirium severity, cognitive and physical function decline, and hospitalization in nursing home patients with acute illness, and 2) to identify features of the intervention associated with occurrence of delirium and other outcomes. Approach: We will screen nursing home patients on 17 long-term care units at a large, urban nursing home who experience onset of a change in condition according to established criteria, and enroll and assign them to intervention or control in a 1:1 ratio. Those assigned to intervention will receive daily visits from an Elder Life Specialist, a mobile Certified Nursing Assistant trained to provide services to counter risks for delirium, including dehydration, immobility, cognitive impairment, undernutrition, and sleep problems, for the duration of the acute illness and for 1 week following. Patients assigned to control will receive usual care from the unit-based nurses and the patient's primary team. Delirium will be assessed 5 days a week by a research assistant. Cognitive and physical function decline and hospital transfer will be ascertained during a 1 month follow-up period. We will compare outcomes between intervention and control, as well as examine associations between outcomes and intervention features such as number and duration of visits.","Delirium is an acute cognitive disorder with features of inattention, disorganized thinking, and disordered consciousness that occurs in one third of hospitalized older adults.

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,OTHER,NCT00250484,TMS Treatment for Pain in Chronic Pancreatitis,The Effect of 10-Day Treatment of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Abdominal Pain in Patients With Chronic Pancreatitis,The researchers aim to study the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on chronic visceral pain in patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis.,"The purpose of this protocol is to investigate a possible novel treatment for intractable visceral pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Pain is a major contributor to the poor quality of life in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The refractory nature of this condition to medical and surgical procedures prompted us to hypothesize that one mechanism leading to pain in these patients is the dysfunction of brain cortical regulation of visceral sensation. This notion is particularly supported by findings that patients with chronic pancreatitis can continue to experience disabling pain even after total pancreatectomy. This suggests that symptoms are sustained by a pancreas-independent, neural-based mechanism. Visceral sensation is particularly processed in the secondary somatosensory area - SII. Therefore, chronic pancreatitis pain may be sustained by a dysfunction of SII rather than by pancreatic inflammation alone. The researchers hypothesize further that the dysfunction of SII is one of hyper-excitability. According to this hypothesis, suppression of SII activity may help control the pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Temporary inhibition of SII activity can be obtained by a novel tool, namely transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which can suppress brain excitability non-invasively beyond the duration of the TMS if appropriate stimulation parameters are employed. In the initial sham controlled, double blind pilot trial of 5 subjects with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis, TMS applied to SII resulted in significant pain improvement in 3 of the subjects. The researchers will rigorously test the hypothesis that chronic pancreatitis pain is sustained by a dysfunction of SII characterized by hyperexcitability through two specific aims:

1. The first aim of this study is to examine whether slow repetitive TMS (rTMS) applied to SII in patients with pain and chronic pancreatitis has an analgesic effect as measured by changes in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and a decrease in analgesic intake, as well as an overall improvement in quality of life. In addition, if this study finds a significant effect of rTMS on pain reduction, the duration of this effect will be further assessed. TMS will be applied at parameters of stimulation known to decrease excitability.
2. The second aim of the study is to assess the safety of rTMS in this patient population. In the pilot study none of the patients experienced any adverse effects of a single session of rTMS. However, the extension of the study protocol to a 10-day course of daily rTMS requires careful safety assessment. Fifteen-day courses of rTMS have been used for treatment of various neuropsychiatric diseases without any complications if safety guidelines are carefully followed. The researchers will adhere to the current safety recommendations for rTMS endorsed by the International Society for Transcranial Stimulation and the International Federation for Clinical Neurophysiology. Therefore, the researchers hypothesize that the proposed rTMS protocol will be safe for the patient population.
3. The third aim of the study is to study the physiologic mechanism of action of rTMS in these patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In doing so, the researchers aim to contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain in patients with pancreatitis by investigating the correlation between pain improvement and areas of brain activation. This could lead to the development of markers of therapeutic response. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows a non-invasive measure of GABAergic and glutamatergic activity in a defined volume of interest in the brain. The researchers hypothesize that the balance of GABA and glutamate will be abnormal in SII in patients with pain from chronic pancreatitis, with a relative decrease in GABA and increase in glutamate indicating an abnormal, hyperexcitable dysfunction. This abnormality will be normalized by rTMS in correlation with its analgesic effect.","Inclusion Criteria:

Patients will be eligible if:

They are age 18 years or older They have daily abdominal pain for at least three months attributed to their chronic pancreatitis Average pain scores (VAS) in the baseline period higher than 4.

The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis will be based on the existence of chronic abdominal pain and at least one of the four following criteria:

Calcifications throughout the pancreas on plain abdominal radiograph. Endoscopically derived pancreatogram showing ductal changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis.

Abnormal secretin pancreatic function test with a peak bicarbonate level of less than 70 mEq/L (normal being \>80 mEq/L).

Tissue diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis from a surgical specimen.

Exclusion Criteria:

Other causes of chronic pancreatitis will be excluded as follows:

Hereditary pancreatitis based on genetic mutations or a family history of pancreatitis; Alcohol abuse (the criteria for ""at risk"" \[heavy\] drinking established by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \[NIAAA\], which suggest that the person is at risk for adverse consequences, are greater than 14 drinks per week or 4 drinks per occasion for men, and greater than 7 drinks per week or 3 drinks per occasion for women);

Medications associated with the development of pancreatitis (e.g. valproic acid, metronidazole, tetracycline, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, azathioprine, pentamidine), trauma, metabolic causes including hyperlipidemia and hypercalcemia, and autoimmune pancreatitis.

The purpose of this protocol is to investigate a possible novel treatment for intractable visceral pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Pain is a major contributor to the poor quality of life in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The refractory nature of this condition to medical and surgical procedures prompted us to hypothesize that one mechanism leading to pain in these patients is the dysfunction of brain cortical regulation of visceral sensation. This notion is particularly supported by findings that patients with chronic pancreatitis can continue to experience disabling pain even after total pancreatectomy. This suggests that symptoms are sustained by a pancreas-independent, neural-based mechanism. Visceral sensation is particularly processed in the secondary somatosensory area - SII. Therefore, chronic pancreatitis pain may be sustained by a dysfunction of SII rather than by pancreatic inflammation alone. The researchers hypothesize further that the dysfunction of SII is one of hyper-excitability. According to this hypothesis, suppression of SII activity may help control the pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Temporary inhibition of SII activity can be obtained by a novel tool, namely transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which can suppress brain excitability non-invasively beyond the duration of the TMS if appropriate stimulation parameters are employed. In the initial sham controlled, double blind pilot trial of 5 subjects with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis, TMS applied to SII resulted in significant pain improvement in 3 of the subjects. The researchers will rigorously test the hypothesis that chronic pancreatitis pain is sustained by a dysfunction of SII characterized by hyperexcitability through two specific aims: 1. The first aim of this study is to examine whether slow repetitive TMS (rTMS) applied to SII in patients with pain and chronic pancreatitis has an analgesic effect as measured by changes in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and a decrease in analgesic intake, as well as an overall improvement in quality of life. In addition, if this study finds a significant effect of rTMS on pain reduction, the duration of this effect will be further assessed. TMS will be applied at parameters of stimulation known to decrease excitability. 2. The second aim of the study is to assess the safety of rTMS in this patient population. In the pilot study none of the patients experienced any adverse effects of a single session of rTMS. However, the extension of the study protocol to a 10-day course of daily rTMS requires careful safety assessment. Fifteen-day courses of rTMS have been used for treatment of various neuropsychiatric diseases without any complications if safety guidelines are carefully followed. The researchers will adhere to the current safety recommendations for rTMS endorsed by the International Society for Transcranial Stimulation and the International Federation for Clinical Neurophysiology. Therefore, the researchers hypothesize that the proposed rTMS protocol will be safe for the patient population. 3. The third aim of the study is to study the physiologic mechanism of action of rTMS in these patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In doing so, the researchers aim to contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain in patients with pancreatitis by investigating the correlation between pain improvement and areas of brain activation. This could lead to the development of markers of therapeutic response. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows a non-invasive measure of GABAergic and glutamatergic activity in a defined volume of interest in the brain. The researchers hypothesize that the balance of GABA and glutamate will be abnormal in SII in patients with pain from chronic pancreatitis, with a relative decrease in GABA and increase in glutamate indicating an abnormal, hyperexcitable dysfunction. This abnormality will be normalized by rTMS in correlation with its analgesic effect. Inclusion Criteria: Patients will be eligible if: They are age 18 years or older They have daily abdominal pain for at least three months attributed to their chronic pancreatitis Average pain scores (VAS) in the baseline period higher than 4. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis will be based on the existence of chronic abdominal pain and at least one of the four following criteria: Calcifications throughout the pancreas on plain abdominal radiograph.

The insulin sensitivity is described by the M-value,which is calculated from glucose infusion rates during the last 30min of the clamp.

Glucose is metabolised in the periphery: 50% by neural tissues, 20% by splanchnic bed and liver, 15% by skeletal muscle, 5% by adipose tissue and 10% by blood cells and other tissues. Under hyperinsulinemic conditions there is a strong shift in glucose utilization: 85% skeletal muscle and 15% by neural tissues, splanchnic bed and liver, adipose tissue, blood cells and other tissues. The contribution of skeletal muscle varies with different insulin sensitivity.

Beijing Anzhen Hospital,OTHER,NCT06433479,Efficacy of Dapagliflozin on Recurrence After Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation,Efficacy of DApagliflozin on REcurrence After Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation,"This is a single-center, parallel-group, randomized, open-label trial evaluating the effect of 3-month treatment with dapagliflozin 10mg once daily on the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients without diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common arrhythmias. Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, as the main means of rhythm control, can effectively maintain sinus rhythm, reduce the recurrence of AF burden, and improve the patient's quality of life and prognosis. However, AF recurrence still occurs in 30-50% of patients after atrial fibrillation catheter ablation, and there is currently no effective strategy to reduce the recurrence rate after atrial fibrillation ablation.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new class of diabetic drugs and large clinical trials have established their multiple cardiovascular benefits. Several studies demonstrated that SGLT2i might reduce AF/atrial flutter events among patients with diabetes. Our cohort study and meta-analysis demonstrated a lower risk of AF recurrence with the use of SGLT2i among patients with diabetes after AF ablation. However, the beneficial effects of SGLT2i in patients after AF catheter ablation without current indications for SGLT2i were uncertain.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on AF burden. Patients with persistent AF undergoing initial catheter ablation without diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease will be enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the dapagliflozin group (10mg/d) for 3 months or the control group stratified according to body mass index (\<24, ≥24kg/m2) or left atrial diameter (\<45，≥45mm).

The primary outcome is atrial fibrillation burden calculated as the percentage of of all atrial arrhythmia episodes detected by 7-day single-lead ECG patches at 3 months after ablation.

Two examiners who had calibration exercised evaluated the restorations at baseline and ten years after according to seven parameters: marginal occlusal adaptation, anatomic form, surface roughness, marginal staining, contact, secondary caries, and luster","Study Design A cohort of 20 patients between the ages of 18 to 80 years old (mean 26.5 years), female (58%) and male (42%), with 40 (Class I and Class II) amalgam restorations, that presented one or more clinical features that deviated from the ideal (Bravo or Charlie according to modified United States Public Health Service USPHS criteria). All of them were recruited at the Operative Dentistry Clinic at the Dental School, University of Chile. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee of the Dental School at the University of Chile (project PRI-ODO-0207), and all patients signed an informed consent form and completed a registration form.

Treatment Group Criteria: 40 defective restorations were evaluated in accordance with the modified USPHS criteria. Restorations with clinically diagnosed secondary caries (Charlie) or under-contoured or over-contoured anatomic form defects and restorations with marginal defects (Bravo) were randomly assigned (Random Number Generator, Microsoft Excel 97) to either, the repair or replacement group. Diagnosis of active secondary caries was done according to Ekstrand's criteria 31.

The groups were labeled A: repair n= 19 (Class I n=8 and Class II n=11) and B: replacement n=21 (Class I n=9 and Class II n=12).

Restorations Assessment and Outcome Measurements. The quality of the restorations was scored according to the modified USPHS criteria (Table 1) 32. Two examiners underwent calibration exercises (JM and EF, Cohen's Kappa inter-examiner coefficient 0.74 at baseline and 0.87 at ten years). The examiners assessed the restorations independently by direct visual and tactile examination (mouth mirror, number 5, Hu Friedy Mfg. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, USA, and explorer, number 23, Hu Friedy) and indirectly by radiographic examination (Bite Wing) at baseline (immediately after treatment) and 10 years after treatment. The seven examined parameters were marginal occlusal adaptation (MA), anatomic form (A), surface roughness (R), Marginal staining (MS), occlusal contact (O), secondary caries (SC), and luster (L) (Table 1). If any difference was recorded between the two examiners, and if they did not reach an agreement, a third clinician, who also underwent calibration exercises (GM), made the final decision.

Treatment Group

A. Repair The clinicians (PV and CM) used Carbide burs (330-010 Komet, Brasseler GmbH Co. Postfach 160.32631, Lemgo, Germany) to explore the defective margin, carious lesion or anatomic form of the restorations. Part of the restorative material adjacent to the defect was removed as an exploratory proceedure thus allowing a proper evaluation and subsequent diagnosis of the extent of the defect. Provided that the defect was limited and localized, the clinician then removed any defective tooth tissue. Mechanical retention was employed inside the existing AM restoration. Rubber dam isolation was used for this procedure. Repair of the restorations was carried out with a dispersed-phased amalgam (Original D, Wyckle Research Inc, Carson City, NV, USA).

B. Replacement The clinicians totally removed and replaced the defective restorations. After completing the cavity preparations, the tooth was restored with a new AM (Original D). Bonding agents and/or liners underneath the amalgam restorations were not used in this trial. Rubber dam isolation was used for all restorative treatments. .

Patients were recalled after four and ten years after the restoration were placed for clinical assessment by the same examiners, applying the same criteria used at baseline. Failed restorations were removed from the study and treated according to their diagnosed needs.

Statistical analysis The ordinal dependent variable was changed in level of the modified USPHS criteria from the baseline value. The assigned score of each restoration reflected the worst result for any of the parameters. The results of each group in terms of degradation or upgrade were analyzed by Friedman range non-parametric test to compare the pre and postoperative conditions. Additionally, the performance of all groups was contrasted using the Mann Whitney test to determine the differences between the upgrade and downgrade of the restoration´s quality. The statistical significance was set at 95%, α=0.05 and β=0.80, SPSS15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis.","Inclusion Criteria:

Democritus University of Thrace,OTHER,NCT04773379,Validation of the PNQ for CIPN Patients.,Validation of the Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire for Patients Suffering From Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Greek.,"The Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ) represents a diagnostic tool concerning patients with Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN). Application of such a tool in the Greek clinical praxis requires validation.

Validation consists of three stages: translation, reverse translation, and patient application. 100 oncologic patients were assessed by comparing the PNQ to the NCI-CTCAE at the chemotherapy onset and 2nd, 4th, and 6th sessions. Specific requirements of the diagnostic tool (compliance, validity, concordance, sensitivity, specificity, reliability) were statistically evaluated.

Differences between translated texts and between the reverse translation and the original were considered negligible. At the 2nd, 4th and 6th session compliance was 98%, 95% and 93% while Cronbach's α was 0,57 0,69 and 0,81 respectively. Cohen's weighted κ was 0,67 and 0,58, Spearman's ρ was 0,7 and 0,98 while AUC of the ROC was 1 and 0,9 for the sensory and the motor part respectively. The variance's linear regression analysis confirmed CIPN worsening over time (p-value\<0,0001).

NYU Langone Health,OTHER,NCT01962779,"Sleep, Aging and Risk for Alzheimer's Disease","Sleep, Aging and Risk for Alzheimer's Disease (SARA) Study","Our preliminary data show for in cognitively-normal elderly, that Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is associated with the increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated-Tau (P-Tau) and total-Tau (T-Tau), decreases in medial temporal lobe glucose uptake (FDG-PET) and volume (MRI) and progressive memory decline, all of which have been shown to be useful in predicting future dementia in older adults. These findings raise the question as to whether Alzheimer's disease (AD) tissue damage causes SDB in the elderly, or alternatively, if SDB acts as a risk factor for AD neurodegeneration. In the proposed study, we will investigate these mechanistic hypotheses in cognitively normal elderly by examining the longitudinal associations between SDB and cognitive decline, novel MR neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers for neurodegeneration; while our secondary goal is to launch a pilot treatment study to aid in interpreting the mechanistic hypotheses and to examine the effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.","Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder with an estimated prevalence in the elderly ranging from 30-80%. The relevance of this high frequency in late life is emerging, as recent evidence suggests that SDB may be associated with the development of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and affects nearly 45% of the population older than 85. Hippocampal atrophy and glucose hypometabolism, as well as changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta-42 (Aβ42), phosphorylated-tau (P-Tau) and total-tau (T-Tau), have been shown to be useful in predicting future decline in cognitively normal older adults, which suggests that AD pathology is detectable prior to cognitive impairment in at-risk subjects. This ""presymptomatic phase"", in which tissue damage is minimal and whose detection precedes clinical symptoms, is an ideal stage for risk factor analysis and intervention trials. Our preliminary data show, for the first time in cognitively-normal elderly, that the severity of SDB (as measured by respiratory events with 4% desaturation, Apnea Hypopnea Index 4% \[AHI4%\]) is associated with the increase of CSF P-Tau and T-Tau, a decrease in glucose uptake (measured by FDG-PET) in the medial temporal lobe, reduced hippocampal volume, and longitudinal memory decline. These findings raise the question as to whether AD tissue damage causes SDB in the elderly, or alternatively, if SDB acts as a risk factor for neurodegeneration. The proposed parent grant for this project conducted at the NYU Center for Brain Health (CBH), is a 5-year NIH-funded longitudinal study of 180 normal elderly (50-95 years), who will undergo complete baseline and 24 month follow-up evaluations. The exams include MR imaging: both structural and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using a novel NYU arterial spin labeling (ASL) protocol and regional brain vasoreactivity estimates after CO2 breathing (VR-CO2); as well as both plasma and CSF biomarkers. The present ancillary proposal, performed in collaboration with NYU's Sleep Disorders Center, will investigate: 1) SDB as a longitudinal predictor of changes in memory, levels of P-tau and T-Tau, hippocampal atrophy, and the blunted VR-CO2 response (all these effects of SDB were observed in cross-section in our pilot work); and 2) if these SDB related phenomena in normal elderly are susceptible to intervention with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in moderate-to-severe SDB subjects. This study has the potential to identify: 1) a highly prevalent AD-related mechanism by which SDB contributes to cognitive decline; 2) the alternative hypothesis, the presence of biomarker features of AD as risks factors for SDB; and 3) that the treatment of SDB with CPAP improves cognition through an AD-related pathway in the elderly.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Male and female subjects with normal cognition and \>50 years of age will be enrolled. Younger subjects are not included as the risk for cognitive impairment is too low. Moreover, by selecting this age-range we minimize the possibility of including early-onset genetic forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal Dementia.
* Normal subjects will be within normal limits on neurological and psychiatric examinations. All subjects enrolled will have both a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0 and Global Deterioration Scale \< 3.
* All subjects will have had a minimum of 12 years education.The education restriction reduces performance variance on cognitive test measures and improves the sensitivity for detecting pathology and disease progression using the robust norms available at NYU School of Medicine.

These findings raise the question as to whether Alzheimer's disease (AD) tissue damage causes SDB in the elderly, or alternatively, if SDB acts as a risk factor for AD neurodegeneration. In the proposed study, we will investigate these mechanistic hypotheses in cognitively normal elderly by examining the longitudinal associations between SDB and cognitive decline, novel MR neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers for neurodegeneration; while our secondary goal is to launch a pilot treatment study to aid in interpreting the mechanistic hypotheses and to examine the effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder with an estimated prevalence in the elderly ranging from 30-80%. The relevance of this high frequency in late life is emerging, as recent evidence suggests that SDB may be associated with the development of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and affects nearly 45% of the population older than 85. Hippocampal atrophy and glucose hypometabolism, as well as changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta-42 (Aβ42), phosphorylated-tau (P-Tau) and total-tau (T-Tau), have been shown to be useful in predicting future decline in cognitively normal older adults, which suggests that AD pathology is detectable prior to cognitive impairment in at-risk subjects. This ""presymptomatic phase"", in which tissue damage is minimal and whose detection precedes clinical symptoms, is an ideal stage for risk factor analysis and intervention trials. Our preliminary data show, for the first time in cognitively-normal elderly, that the severity of SDB (as measured by respiratory events with 4% desaturation, Apnea Hypopnea Index 4% \[AHI4%\]) is associated with the increase of CSF P-Tau and T-Tau, a decrease in glucose uptake (measured by FDG-PET) in the medial temporal lobe, reduced hippocampal volume, and longitudinal memory decline. These findings raise the question as to whether AD tissue damage causes SDB in the elderly, or alternatively, if SDB acts as a risk factor for neurodegeneration. The proposed parent grant for this project conducted at the NYU Center for Brain Health (CBH), is a 5-year NIH-funded longitudinal study of 180 normal elderly (50-95 years), who will undergo complete baseline and 24 month follow-up evaluations. The exams include MR imaging: both structural and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using a novel NYU arterial spin labeling (ASL) protocol and regional brain vasoreactivity estimates after CO2 breathing (VR-CO2); as well as both plasma and CSF biomarkers. The present ancillary proposal, performed in collaboration with NYU's Sleep Disorders Center, will investigate: 1) SDB as a longitudinal predictor of changes in memory, levels of P-tau and T-Tau, hippocampal atrophy, and the blunted VR-CO2 response (all these effects of SDB were observed in cross-section in our pilot work); and 2) if these SDB related phenomena in normal elderly are susceptible to intervention with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in moderate-to-severe SDB subjects. This study has the potential to identify: 1) a highly prevalent AD-related mechanism by which SDB contributes to cognitive decline; 2) the alternative hypothesis, the presence of biomarker features of AD as risks factors for SDB; and 3) that the treatment of SDB with CPAP improves cognition through an AD-related pathway in the elderly.

Izmir Katip Celebi University,OTHER,NCT05839184,The Effectiveness of the Therapeutic Toys During Intravenous Canula Insertion,The Effectiveness of the Therapeutic Toys on the Comfort Level of the Infants During Intravenous Canula Insertion,"Pain relief interventions in invasive interventions are divided into two pharmacologic methods and non-pharmacologic methods. Nonpharmacologic interventions are an area where nurses can easily demonstrate their independent roles. Especially today, when the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods is increasing, nurses are also turning to these methods.

Non-pharmacological methods include listening to white noise, non-nutritive sucking, aromatherapy applications, placing the baby on the mother's lap, changing position, rocking, touching, distracting, listening to music, watching cartoons, singing, breastfeeding and giving sucrose solution with breast milk, giving toys and smelling mother odour.

This study was planned to determine the effect of the therapeutic toy used during IV catheter placement, which is the most common invasive intervention in the Neonatal Care Unit where a newborn baby is hospitalized, on the comfort level, crying time and physiological parameters of the newborn.","Comfort is defined as ""the expected result with a complex structure within biopsychosocial and environmental integrity in order to provide help, peace of mind and cope with problems related to one's needs"". According to Kolcaba, comfort is the experience of relief, peace of mind and meeting needs to solve problems. The term comfort has been frequently used in recent years for infants receiving health care in Neonatal and Neonatal Surgery Intensive Care Units. Physical characteristics of the clinic, immaturity of newborns, frequent routine care and invasive procedures (burn dressing, hydrotherapy, blood collection, IV catheter insertion, heel prick, aspiration, nasogastric catheter insertion, foley catheter insertion, rectal tube insertion, neonatal eye examination) cause a decrease in the comfort of newborns.

As a result of rapidly increasing technological developments, changes are also seen in the neonatal discipline and perinatal mortality rates are decreasing, especially in developing countries. As a result of this development, survival rates of very low birth weight newborns have increased to 85%. Although mortality has decreased in preterm infants, neurodevelopmental, pulmonary and cardiac problems have increased. When the causes of neurodevelopmental problems in preterm infants are examined, it is seen that in addition to retinopathy, systemic infections, nutritional problems due to necrotizing enterocolitis and similar causes, intracranial haemorrhage, there are also stressors such as invasive procedures, pain, noise and light that the newborn is exposed to in the intensive care unit. Stress has negative effects on neurodevelopment.

Newborns who have not reached neurodevelopmental maturity begin to experience stress when they leave their warm, dark, quiet and calm environments that contribute to their brain development and start to receive health care in intensive care units where they are exposed to noisy, light and painful procedures. This stress and invasive sensory experiences are thought to suppress the development of cell migration, synaptogenesis, myelinization and organizational structures in the infant's nervous system.","Inclusion Criteria:

Prolonged labor, namely during the 2nd stage, is one of the main obstetric risk factors responsible for anal sphincter rupture and fecal incontinence. In addition, it is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidities including increased risk of lower genital tract lacerations. In an effort to shorten labor and decrease lower genital tract trauma many techniques have been investigated.

The objective of our study is to investigate whether the use of obstetric gel shortens the first and second stage of labor and exerts a protective effect on the lower genital tract. Neonatal and maternal morbidities will be also assessed.

The study design will be a randomized controlled trial of 2 groups, where the patients presenting for vaginal delivery will be randomly assigned to either:

* Group 1 who will receive the standard care during labor and delivery

Prolonged labor, namely during the 2nd stage, is one of the main obstetric risk factors responsible for anal sphincter rupture and fecal incontinence. In addition, it is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidities including increased risk of lower genital tract lacerations. In an effort to shorten labor and decrease lower genital tract trauma many techniques have been investigated. The objective of our study is to investigate whether the use of obstetric gel shortens the first and second stage of labor and exerts a protective effect on the lower genital tract. Neonatal and maternal morbidities will be also assessed. The study design will be a randomized controlled trial of 2 groups, where the patients presenting for vaginal delivery will be randomly assigned to either: * Group 1 who will receive the standard care during labor and delivery * Group 2 who will receive the standard care during labor and delivery with the vaginal application of the obstetrical gel The goal of this randomized controlled study is to compare the length of the first and 2nd stage of labor and the lower genital tract integrity in the 2 groups of patients.

The study will be proposed to patients with AMD and patients with AMD and concomitant open angle glaucoma (OAG).

The study will be conducted in two stages. In both stages, patients will remain ambulatory and will be encouraged to follow a schedule as close to their usual lifestyle as possible, with the exception of particular activities such as caffeine intake, playing wind instruments, yoga and strenuous exercise. A patient diary will be distributed for the capture of patient activities during the TF pattern recording. Upon completion of each session, the CLS (contact lens sensor) will be removed and a final ophthalmic examination will be conducted.

In the first stage of the study, 20 patients with neovascular AMD with an IOP in the normal range and no concomitant glaucoma will be recruited. After having signed and dated the patient informed consent form, patients will undergo an initial ophthalmic examination. One eye will be selected for the study. If both eyes are eligible, the study eye will be selected in random manner.

All 20 AMD patients will receive two 24-hour recording sessions (S) with the TF CLS, at monthly interval. In the first session (S1) anti-VEGF injection will be carried out according to the study center standard protocol. For the second 24-hour TF recording session (S2), patients will be randomly distributed into three groups. Group A, consisting of 5 patients, will receive anti-VEGF injection with a different anti-VEGF substance as compared to S1. Group B, also consisting of 5 patients, will receive anti-VEGF without sclerotomy occlusion after injection as compared to S1. Finally, group C, including 10 patients, will receive anti-VEGF in a different dose (injection volume) as compared to S1. The randomization ratio between groups A, B and C is 1:1:2.

The overall study duration for an eligible patient in the first stage of this study is limited to 5 weeks.

If in the first stage of this study an injection protocol is identified that provokes significantly lesser elevation on the TF pattern, the alternative injection protocol will be evaluated against the current standard protocol. For the second stage, 30 patients of whom 15 with neovascular AMD and 15 with neovascular AMD and concomitant OAG will be recruited. After giving informed consent and confirmation of eligibility, all patients will receive two 24-hour TF CLS recording sessions (S3 and S4) at monthly interval, during which anti-VEGF injection according to the standard and alternative protocol will be carried out in random sequence.

The overall study duration for a patient in the second stage of the study is limited to 5 weeks.

The study has been planned to recruit 20 eligible patients in the first stage within 12 weeks from the date of initiation. The second stage will recruit 30 patients within 16 weeks.

In advanced-stage knee osteoarthritis, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is performed to reduce pain and loss of function. However, in the postoperative period, patients may encounter various problems such as pain, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and difficulties in daily living activities.

This study investigates how continuous care counseling based on Roy's Adaptation Model affects the comfort and quality of life of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Roy's Adaptation Model is a widely used approach in nursing that supports individuals in adapting to changes they experience. Counseling and education provided in line with this model aim to help patients cope with the physical and psychological problems they face before and after surgery.

In the study, specially designed training and counseling services were offered to patients who underwent surgery, and the effects of these services on pain, anxiety, sleep quality, and daily living activities were evaluated. The results of the research indicate that continuous care counseling based on Roy's Adaptation Model may be effective in improving patients' postoperative comfort and quality of life. These findings may contribute to the improvement of postoperative care for both patients and healthcare professionals.","Osteoarthritis is a chronic joint disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is particularly prevalent among the elderly population. Knee osteoarthritis leads to significant problems such as severe pain, restricted mobility, and loss of independence, thereby negatively impacting quality of life. In advanced stages of knee osteoarthritis, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a commonly preferred surgical method to reduce pain and loss of function. However, in the postoperative period following TKA, patients may experience multidimensional problems such as pain, sleep disturbances, psychological stress, anxiety, and difficulties in daily living activities.

In modern nursing practice, the management of these problems experienced by patients before and after surgery and the improvement of their quality of life are of great importance. Roy's Adaptation Model is a theoretical framework frequently utilized in nursing that supports individuals in adapting to environmental changes and stressors. This model advocates for a holistic assessment of patients in terms of their physiological, psychological, social, and role functions, and for the structuring of care plans accordingly.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of continuous care counseling based on Roy's Adaptation Model on the comfort and quality of life of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. In the research, specially designed training and counseling services were provided to patients who underwent surgery, and the effects of these services on pain, anxiety, sleep quality, and daily living activities were evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Within the scope of the study, patients in the intervention group received continuous care counseling and video-supported education based on the Roy Adaptation Model, while the control group received standard care.

Patients will receive micafungin for the period necessary to achieve clinical and / or mycological cure. An attempt will be made to have 2 PK curves, one full and one limited sampling on days 3 (n=9) and 7 (n=5). Furthermore, we will be able to determine intra-individual variability. On non-PK days, trough samples will be taken to determine the time to steady state. All samples will be taken just prior to the morning dose of micafungin. All infusion rates will be according to the SPC label information. Patients are considered to be evaluable if at least the first PK curve has been completed. Two moments of PK analysis will enable us to determine whether there is an increase over time in exposure if steady state has not been reached.","Whilst micafungin (Mycamine®) has much to offer, little is known about its pharmacokinetic profile in ICU patients with specific co-morbidities such as obesity, hypoalbumenia, and severe liverfunction disturbances. Also, ICU patients are known to experience changes in pharmacokinetics (PK) due to changes in hemodynamics, extracorporeal elimination techniques, interacting comedication, etc. Based on criteria outlined below, micafungin may prove to be the drug of choice in this cohort of patients. Therefore it seems prudent to conduct a trial in a cohort of patients who receive micafungin but with co-variates that may be of influence to the pharmacokinetic profile. To build a valid pharmacokinetic model, all patients on micafungin will be included in the analysis and used for model building. Co-variates that will be explored are at least: obesitas, liverfunction, albumin, creatinin-clearance. Simulations will be performed to determine if adequate exposure is reached under different patho-physiological conditions.

In conclusion: this trial is on determining the PK of micafungin in a non-selected cohort of patients with suspected or proven invasive fungal infections. Most important covariates will be modelled using advanced mathematical techniques. Micafungin may prove to be beneficial over the other two echinocandins in terms of limited factors that impact PK.

Most important covariates will be modelled using advanced mathematical techniques. Micafungin may prove to be beneficial over the other two echinocandins in terms of limited factors that impact PK. This has to be proven in a prospective trial. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Patient is admitted to an ICU 2. Subject is at least 18 years of age on the day of the first dosing 3. If subject is female: neither pregnant nor able to become pregnant and is not nursing an infant 4. Subject has been treated with micafungin for a maximum of two days before enrolment in this trial 5. Is managed with a central venous catheter or an arterial catheter Exclusion Criteria: 1. Is known to be hypersensitive to echinocandin antifungal agents 2. Documented history of sensitivity to excipients similar to those found in the micafungin preparation 3. Known of positive HIV test or positive hepatitis B or C test in history 4. History of or current abuse of drugs, alcohol or solvents 5. Has previously participated in this trial"

Montefiore Medical Center,OTHER,NCT04005079,Pilocarpine After Combined Cataract/Trabectome Surgery,A Prospective Randomized Control Trial of Pilocarpine Use After Combined Cataract/Trabectome Surgery,"Combined cataract + trabectome surgery is a surgery designed to help lower the intraocular pressure (pressure in the eye) and hopefully reduce the need for topical drops, progression of glaucoma, and/or further glaucoma surgeries. The purpose of this study is to assess whether using pilocarpine, a medication which is FDA approved to induce miosis, (in other words cause the pupil to constrict or become smaller) provides additional benefit to the success of Trabectome and cataract surgery.","Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and its treatment consists of lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. Microincisional glaucoma surgery (MIGS) have become more popular in recent years as less invasive methods than traditional surgeries that effectively reduce IOP and help reduce the medication burden on patients.There are multiple available MIGS procedures, most of which act by increasing trabecular outflow. One such procedure is the Trabectome, which is usually performed in combination with cataract surgery.

Trabectome is an FDA approved device used to perform a trabeculectomy via an internal approach. A strip of 60-120 degrees of the nasal angle trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemm's canal are removed providing a direct pathway for aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber into the collector channels\[2\].

Pilocarpine, a parasympathomimetic agent, is a glaucoma medication that works by causing contraction of the ciliary muscle leading to opening of the trabecular meshwork\[3\]. Due to its frequent dosing requirement and large number of ocular and systemic side effects, pilocarpine has largely fallen out of favor for the treatment of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), except in patients for whom few other alternatives exist. However, pilocarpine is often used after trabectome surgery.

The rationale for its use after Trabectome procedure is for its miotic effect, which theoretically may prevent the formation of peripheral anterior synechiae. Formation of peripheral anterior synechiae can lead to the closure of the cleft that is generated and the possibility of failure of the procedure. While the theoretical benefit of pilocarpine has been proposed, its actual benefit has never been proven.

Assiut University,OTHER,NCT06683079,Comparison Between Colloids and Crystalloids on Coagulation and Blood Loss,Comparison of the Effects of Hydroxyethyl Starch and Ringer's Lactate on Blood Loss and Coagulation After Colorectal Surgery.,"Infusion of intravenous fluids is mandatory especially in major and prolonged surgeries. However, there is no available optimum ideal type of fluid nor a fixed amount suitable for transfusion but it must be individualized for every patient to minimize the side effects of fluids.

Ringer's lactate as an example of crystalloids, causes a transient hypercoagulable state after its infusion, disappears in less than 6 hours of infusion and the coagulation profile returns to its state before Ringer's.

Voluven (Hydroxyehthyl starch 130/0.4) a colloid causes a hypocoagulable state after its infusion, and its effect is prolonged to more than 6 hours after infusion.

The effects of hydroxyethyl starch are not dose-dependent, but they can be remarkable even with mild to moderate amount of blood dilution applying nearly a restrictive fluid transfusion strategy and a goal-directed fluid therapy mode.

The amount of needed crystalloids is much more than that of colloids to maintain patients hemodynamically stable.","When considering the optimum fluid of choice to achieve hemodynamic stability and the least morbidity, colloids have a theoritical and intuitive advantage. Being composed of molecules \>35 kDa, colloids have traditionally been thought to have greater fluid efficacy (i.e. they remain in the intravascular space for longer ,thus contributing a greater effect on cardiac output) compared with crystalloids. These theoritical benefits of colloids led to their routine use in goal-directed therapy (GDT).

Studies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated that crystalloids tend to expand the intravascular volume by about 20% of the infused volume ;however when physiological endpoints have been used in clinical studies , the fluid efficacy of crystalloids increases up to 60%. This discrepancy may be explained by a number of factors, including the time taken for fluid to equilibrate throughout the extracellular fluid , the vaodilating effect of anethetic-indused hypotension on vascular capacitance, and the impairment of fluid elimination because of the surgical stress response.

While colloid has been the default fluid choice in most GDT studies to date, recent evidence from both the perioperative anesthestic setting and from intensive care have raised concerns that these agents may produce adverse effects on renal function and coagulation . recent studies have sought to compare the use of crystalloid solutions with colloids for GDT.","Inclusion Criteria:

Proposed research will investigate whether such nightmares might serve as targets for imaginal exposure during prolonged exposure therapy (PE), a first-line treatment for PTSD. Learning and memory of fear extinction are the neurocognitive underpinnings of PE and increased physiological arousal during PE can aid in extinction learning. Thus, PE using TRNs might enhance treatment outcomes because of the greater immediacy and salience of nightmares relative to the more temporally distant traumatic event. Our research group has developed standardized script-driven imagery (SDI) procedures whereby the degree of psychophysiological arousal induced by recollection of the traumatic event that precipitated posttraumatic symptoms (index trauma) can be assessed. Our team has also developed a novel ambulatory device, the NINscan, that can record skin conductance (SC), facial electromyography (EMG) and electrocardiography (ECG) along with simultaneous functional near-infrared spectroscopic (fNIRS) imaging of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). The LPFC encompasses regions that activate and/or deactivate during SDI in persons with PTSD and includes the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), an area that plays an important role in inhibiting unwanted behavior and cognition and shows reduced inhibitory performance in PTSD. Following screenings that include a structured clinical evaluation establishing PTSD diagnosis and self-report of a least 2 TRNs per week, qualified participants will record an account of their index trauma. They will then complete 2 weeks of sleep diaries and wrist actigraphy with 4 nights of ambulatory polysomnography (PSG), during which they will audio-record, on a time-stamped digital recorder, a detailed nightmare report following any nightmare-induced awakening. A TRN report having sufficient length, clarity and resemblance to the index trauma will be selected and, along with the index-trauma report, will be re-recorded as a script for SDI.

One script will be derived from their index trauma and the other from their TRN, the order of which will be counterbalanced across participants. Psychophysiological response and fNIRS LPFC activation will be compared between scripts using 2 primary outcome measures: (1) a validated canonical psychophysiological variable combining SC, EMG and ECG, and (2) script-related activation of the rIFC.

Stanford University,OTHER,NCT02437084,"Relationship Between Insulin Resistance and Statin Induced Type 2 Diabetes, and Integrative Personal Omics Profiling","Relationship Between Insulin Resistance and Statin Induced Type 2 Diabetes, and Integrative Personal Omics Profiling","Background:

There is general agreement that statin-treatment of patients to lower plasma cholesterol levels can increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in some individuals1-5. The physiologic mechanism for the increased risk for T2D from statin treatment is unknown but could result from effects on insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. This study will evaluate how the medication atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor) works in non-diabetic individuals in regards to its effect on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to help further understand the possible cause of the increased occurrence of T2D in people who are at risk for T2D. This research study will also examine what metabolic characteristics and variables (for example insulin resistance, high triglycerides, or both) will identify those people at highest risk of statin-induced T2D.

The goals of this study are to:

1. determine the effect of high-intensity atorvastatin (40 mg/day) for \~ 10 weeks on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (defined with gold standard methods) (PRIMARY OUTCOMES) as well as other glycemic traits (SECONDARY OUTCOMES);
2. compare a number of cardio-metabolic characteristics (e.g. weight, lipids) before, during, and after administration of atorvastatin;
3. determine if significant deterioration of insulin action and/or secretion following statin treatment will be confined to those with baseline insulin resistance (PRE-SPECIFIED SUBGROUP ANALYSES);
4. perform Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) 6,7 before and after taking atorvastatin to examine treatment-associated changes in all baseline variables and to analyze not only previously-known drug efficacy but also untargeted drug efficacy (EXPLORATORY ANALYSES).

General approach:

This will be an open-label study to evaluate the diabetogenic effect of atorvastatin (40 mg/day for 10 weeks) on both insulin action and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. To ensure we recruit individuals across a broad range of insulin sensitivity, we will target recruitment to enrich for those with combined increases in LDL-C and TG concentrations (see SIGNIFICANCE and RATIONALE). The experimental population will consist of \~75 apparently healthy, non-diabetic volunteers eligible for statin therapy but without pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Following baseline assessments of co-primary outcome measures: insulin sensitivity (by insulin suppression test, IST) and insulin secretion (by graded glucose infusion test, GGIT), participants will be placed on a weight maintenance diet and treated with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin. All baseline measurements will be repeated \~10 weeks later with iPOP8 measurements done at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, and 10 on atorvastatin, and at weeks 4 and 8 off atorvastatin.","1. SIGNIFICANCE

   Statins and the risk of T2D: Statin treatment is associated with an increase in incident T2D.1-4 5

   Mechanism of statin-induced T2D: It is unclear whether statins increase the risk of T2D by decreasing insulin action, secretion, or both. Several manuscripts have been published that substantially increase understanding of the link between statin use and incident T2D. Swerdlow, et al.2 based on evidence from genetic analysis and randomized trials, concluded that the increased risk of T2D noted with statins is at least ""partially explained by HMG-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibition."" They also noted an association of weight gain with HMGCR variants in statin-treated patients, leading to the notion that decreases in insulin sensitivity contribute to statin-induced diabetes. In that context, Cederberg, at al.9 have shown in a large prospective study (n=8749 men) that participants treated with statins (n=2142) had a 46% increase in incident T2D, associated with a 24% decrease in insulin sensitivity and a 12% decrease in insulin secretion assessed by surrogate measures.

   Identifying those with at enhanced risk of statin-induced T2D: Studies of 3 randomized clinical trials with atorvastatin by David Waters' group 1,3,4 have demonstrated that ""baseline fasting glucose, body mass index, hypertension, and fasting triglycerides were independent predictors of T2D."" These abnormalities form a cluster attributed to insulin resistance.10 Since insulin resistance is a predictor of developing T2D, it seems likely that the more insulin resistant the individuals are before treatment, the greater is their risk to for statin-induced T2D.

   In that context, relatively little attention has been given to the role that metabolic heterogeneity in patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations might play in statin-induced T2D. Specifically, subjects with elevated LDL-C concentrations, whose plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations are also elevated, are insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic, and glucose intolerant as compared to those with isolated LDL-C levels. As such, this subset of patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations can be viewed as being at a ""tipping point,"" and any adverse effect of statins on insulin action and/or secretion, irrespective of how mediated, places them at enhanced risk to develop statin-induced diabetes. Indeed, we have shown (Kohli et al)1 that patients with both insulin resistance (as estimated by high TGs) and prediabetes are at particularly high risk of statin-induced T2D.

   We seek to address 2 important unanswered questions: Do statins primarily affect insulin resistance or insulin secretion?; Are there subsets of individuals at highest risk of statin-induced T2D?
2. RATIONALE, HYPOTHESIS

   Rationale:

   T2D develops when insulin resistant individuals cannot maintain the degree of compensatory hyperinsulinemia needed to maintain normal glucose tolerance. However, significant fundamental questions remain. For example, what is the cellular/molecular link between statin treatment and changes in insulin action and secretion?

   This proposal is based on the premise that studying the effect of statins on insulin action and insulin secretion using ""gold standard"" methods will help determine if statins adversely affect the risk of T2D by increasing insulin resistance or decreasing insulin secretion. We use the insulin suppression test (with the read-out of steady-state plasma glucose, SSPG) to ascertain insulin sensitivity and the graded glucose infusion test (with the readout of insulin secretion rate, ISR) to ascertain insulin secretion both before and after statin treatment in non-diabetic individuals.

   We hypothesize that treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance. Thus, we plan to look at the effect of atorvastatin not only in all participants but also in subsets of individuals with baseline insulin resistance (which will be enriched for by recruiting volunteers with elevated plasma TG levels (≥150 mg/dL) at baseline. The rationale for this is that plasma TGs are a surrogate measure for insulin resistance with a modest correlation with the direct measure of insulin resistance (steady-state plasma glucose) measured by the insulin suppression test. Clinically, subjects with elevated TGs prior to statin treatment would have substantial clinical benefit from statins, and one of investigators' secondary goals is to demonstrate that a simple measurement of plasma TG concentration (as a surrogate for insulin resistance) can help identify those most at risk of statin induced derangements in glycemic control. Consequently, we propose to enroll nondiabetic volunteers at high-risk for T2D, free of known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), not receiving statins, eligible for statin therapy according to ACC/AHA (American College for Cardiology/American Heart Association) 2013 guidelines.11 We will also target recruitment efforts to enrich for subjects with plasma TG concentration ≥ 150 mg/dL to ensure that we enroll subjects across the range of insulin sensitivity.

   Hypothesis: We hypothesize that high intensity atorvastatin treatment for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance.

4. STUDY PROCEDURES

   Recruitment

   Preliminary recruitment strategies will include:

   Volunteers will be recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area through advertisements in newspapers, posted flyers, and the social networking site NextDoor as well as from the Preventive Cardiology Clinics at Stanford Health Care. Our goal is to ensure recruitment across a broad range of insulin sensitivity. Prior work from our group and others has shown that high plasma TG concentrations are associated with increased insulin resistance as assessed by reference measures. Therefore, we will target advertisements to enrich for individuals with high TG levels (\> 150 mg/dL) as a surrogate for increased insulin resistance.

   Participant Visits and Procedures

   Potential participants will be screened initially when they call or email in response to recruitment ads, or a letter from their MD, describing the study as follows:

   Preliminary intake will occur over the phone.

   Visit 1 Screening visit.

   Visit 2: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): This test will take approximately 3 hours.

   i) Glycemic status: Participants will be classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or combined IFG/IGT12. In addition, the total integrated plasma glucose response during the OGTT will be calculated by the trapezoidal method (Glucose-AUC).

   ii) β-cell function: Calculations of the Insulin Secretion- Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) will be used to quantify insulin secretory function 13, if for some reason a graded glucose infusion study is not done. The ISSI-2 is a validated OGTT- derived method to measure of β-cell function, analogous to the disposition index obtained from the intravenous glucose tolerance test 14. It is calculated by multiplying the insulin secretory response during the OGTT (Insulin-AUC/Glucose-AUC) by insulin resistance (Matsuda index).

   The fasting and 2-hour glucose results will be discussed with the study participant and a copy of the results will be given to them.

   Visit 3. Graded Glucose Infusion, GGIT 15,16: This test will take approximately 6 hours.

   This test is designed to assess the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin in response to a graded glucose infusion. During this test, subjects will have two small IV catheters placed, one in each arm. One IV will be used for drawing samples and the other for the infusion of glucose. During the GGIT, continuous intravenous infusions of glucose will be given at progressively increasing rates: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 kg/min in six infusion periods of 40-min duration. Blood samples will be collected for measurements of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations at fasting and at 30 min and 40 min into each infusion period. The two values during the last 10 min of each infusion period will be averaged. The amount of blood taken for this test will 47.5 ml.

   Visit 4.Insulin Suppression test, IST 17,18: This test will take approximately 6 hours.

   This test is designed to determine whole body insulin sensitivity. Following an overnight fast, subjects will have an IV placed in each arm. One for collection of blood and the other for infusion with octreotide (0.27 μg/m2/min), insulin (32 mU/m2/min), and glucose (267 mg/m2/min) for 180 minutes. During the test, endogenous insulin is suppressed and all individuals are given the same concentration of insulin, based on their body surface area. Blood is drawn every 30 minutes for 150 minutes and then at 10-minute intervals from 150 to 180 minutes of the infusion to measure plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. The mean of the last four values is used as the steady-state plasma insulin (SSPI) and glucose (SSPG) concentrations for each individual. As SSPI concentrations are similar in all subjects during the IST, the SSPG concentration provides a direct measure of the ability of insulin to mediate disposal of an infused glucose load; the higher the SSPG concentration, the more insulin resistant the individual. Labs to check kidney and liver function plus a lipid panel and a urine pregnancy test (if appropriate) will be done at this visit. Blood drawn or IST will be 58.5 ml and 5 ml for SHC labs.

   Labs for iPOP will be drawn at this time and additional samples will be obtained for transcriptome, microbiome, metabolome, and proteome analysis in blood; nasal, tongue, skin surface swabs; urine; and stool.

   The study drug, atorvastatin 40 mg will be given to study participants, once all labs have been reviewed and participant qualifies.

   Visit 5-7: Visits will be every 2 weeks for a total of 10 weeks on study medication (statin). Participants will be assessed for any side effects or adverse events (AE) on the statin. Adherence to study medication will be assessed at each visit.

   Visit 8: Weight, vital signs, and OGTT described above.

   Visit 9: Repeat GGIT as described above.

   Visit 10: Repeat IST and iPOP lab testing and samples as described above. At the end of this visit, the statin will be stopped and the study participant would be scheduled for 4- and 8-week follow up visits.

   Visit 11: One month off statin study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above.

   Visit 12: Last study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above.

   Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaire about her/his physical activity status, food and eating habits, and stress at the time of each iPOP.
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Based on our prior work19, we calculated that with 60 subjects, we would be able to detect an 8% change in SSPG concentration and an 8% change in ISRAUC after atorvastatin therapy with 80% power and two-side significance level of 5% using a paired samples t test. Thus, we estimated needing to enroll 75 subjects with an anticipated a dropout rate of 20%.

Summary statistics will be reported as median (interquartile range) or number (percent) of participants unless otherwise specified. Shapiro-Wilk tests will be used to assess normality of data, and variables that are not normally distributed will be log-transformed. Percent changes in variables will be calculated by the formula: \[(end-of study value) - (baseline value) / baseline value\] x 100. Paired samples t tests will be used to compare baseline and end-of-study means. One sample t tests will be employed to evaluate whether percent changes in variables are significantly different from zero (no change). Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated to determine the strength of association between variables of interest. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be carried out by stratifying for insulin resistant versus insulin sensitive subjects. The SSPG concentration median will be used to define subjects as being insulin resistant or insulin sensitive. Insulin resistant and insulin sensitive group means will be compared by independent sample t tests and proportions by chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Statistical analyses will be performed by using statistical software IBM SPSS version 26.0.","Inclusion Criteria:

The physiologic mechanism for the increased risk for T2D from statin treatment is unknown but could result from effects on insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. This study will evaluate how the medication atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor) works in non-diabetic individuals in regards to its effect on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to help further understand the possible cause of the increased occurrence of T2D in people who are at risk for T2D. This research study will also examine what metabolic characteristics and variables (for example insulin resistance, high triglycerides, or both) will identify those people at highest risk of statin-induced T2D. The goals of this study are to: 1. determine the effect of high-intensity atorvastatin (40 mg/day) for \~ 10 weeks on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (defined with gold standard methods) (PRIMARY OUTCOMES) as well as other glycemic traits (SECONDARY OUTCOMES); 2. compare a number of cardio-metabolic characteristics (e.g. weight, lipids) before, during, and after administration of atorvastatin; 3. determine if significant deterioration of insulin action and/or secretion following statin treatment will be confined to those with baseline insulin resistance (PRE-SPECIFIED SUBGROUP ANALYSES); 4. perform Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) 6,7 before and after taking atorvastatin to examine treatment-associated changes in all baseline variables and to analyze not only previously-known drug efficacy but also untargeted drug efficacy (EXPLORATORY ANALYSES). General approach: This will be an open-label study to evaluate the diabetogenic effect of atorvastatin (40 mg/day for 10 weeks) on both insulin action and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. To ensure we recruit individuals across a broad range of insulin sensitivity, we will target recruitment to enrich for those with combined increases in LDL-C and TG concentrations (see SIGNIFICANCE and RATIONALE). The experimental population will consist of \~75 apparently healthy, non-diabetic volunteers eligible for statin therapy but without pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Following baseline assessments of co-primary outcome measures: insulin sensitivity (by insulin suppression test, IST) and insulin secretion (by graded glucose infusion test, GGIT), participants will be placed on a weight maintenance diet and treated with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin. All baseline measurements will be repeated \~10 weeks later with iPOP8 measurements done at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, and 10 on atorvastatin, and at weeks 4 and 8 off atorvastatin. 1. SIGNIFICANCE Statins and the risk of T2D: Statin treatment is associated with an increase in incident T2D.1-4 5 Mechanism of statin-induced T2D: It is unclear whether statins increase the risk of T2D by decreasing insulin action, secretion, or both. Several manuscripts have been published that substantially increase understanding of the link between statin use and incident T2D. Swerdlow, et al.2 based on evidence from genetic analysis and randomized trials, concluded that the increased risk of T2D noted with statins is at least ""partially explained by HMG-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibition."" They also noted an association of weight gain with HMGCR variants in statin-treated patients, leading to the notion that decreases in insulin sensitivity contribute to statin-induced diabetes. In that context, Cederberg, at al.9 have shown in a large prospective study (n=8749 men) that participants treated with statins (n=2142) had a 46% increase in incident T2D, associated with a 24% decrease in insulin sensitivity and a 12% decrease in insulin secretion assessed by surrogate measures. Identifying those with at enhanced risk of statin-induced T2D: Studies of 3 randomized clinical trials with atorvastatin by David Waters' group 1,3,4 have demonstrated that ""baseline fasting glucose, body mass index, hypertension, and fasting triglycerides were independent predictors of T2D."" These abnormalities form a cluster attributed to insulin resistance.10 Since insulin resistance is a predictor of developing T2D, it seems likely that the more insulin resistant the individuals are before treatment, the greater is their risk to for statin-induced T2D. In that context, relatively little attention has been given to the role that metabolic heterogeneity in patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations might play in statin-induced T2D. Specifically, subjects with elevated LDL-C concentrations, whose plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations are also elevated, are insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic, and glucose intolerant as compared to those with isolated LDL-C levels. As such, this subset of patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations can be viewed as being at a ""tipping point,"" and any adverse effect of statins on insulin action and/or secretion, irrespective of how mediated, places them at enhanced risk to develop statin-induced diabetes. Indeed, we have shown (Kohli et al)1 that patients with both insulin resistance (as estimated by high TGs) and prediabetes are at particularly high risk of statin-induced T2D. We seek to address 2 important unanswered questions: Do statins primarily affect insulin resistance or insulin secretion?; Are there subsets of individuals at highest risk of statin-induced T2D? 2. RATIONALE, HYPOTHESIS Rationale: T2D develops when insulin resistant individuals cannot maintain the degree of compensatory hyperinsulinemia needed to maintain normal glucose tolerance. However, significant fundamental questions remain. For example, what is the cellular/molecular link between statin treatment and changes in insulin action and secretion? This proposal is based on the premise that studying the effect of statins on insulin action and insulin secretion using ""gold standard"" methods will help determine if statins adversely affect the risk of T2D by increasing insulin resistance or decreasing insulin secretion. We use the insulin suppression test (with the read-out of steady-state plasma glucose, SSPG) to ascertain insulin sensitivity and the graded glucose infusion test (with the readout of insulin secretion rate, ISR) to ascertain insulin secretion both before and after statin treatment in non-diabetic individuals. We hypothesize that treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance. Thus, we plan to look at the effect of atorvastatin not only in all participants but also in subsets of individuals with baseline insulin resistance (which will be enriched for by recruiting volunteers with elevated plasma TG levels (≥150 mg/dL) at baseline. The rationale for this is that plasma TGs are a surrogate measure for insulin resistance with a modest correlation with the direct measure of insulin resistance (steady-state plasma glucose) measured by the insulin suppression test. Clinically, subjects with elevated TGs prior to statin treatment would have substantial clinical benefit from statins, and one of investigators' secondary goals is to demonstrate that a simple measurement of plasma TG concentration (as a surrogate for insulin resistance) can help identify those most at risk of statin induced derangements in glycemic control. Consequently, we propose to enroll nondiabetic volunteers at high-risk for T2D, free of known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), not receiving statins, eligible for statin therapy according to ACC/AHA (American College for Cardiology/American Heart Association) 2013 guidelines.11 We will also target recruitment efforts to enrich for subjects with plasma TG concentration ≥ 150 mg/dL to ensure that we enroll subjects across the range of insulin sensitivity. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that high intensity atorvastatin treatment for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance. 3.

They are often difficult or impossible to treat with existing methods. This study will test the use of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to mitigate auditory verbal hallucinations in patients whose hallucinations are resistant to medication. Half of the patients will receive real time fMRI neurofeedback from a brain region involved in auditory hallucinations and half will receive it from motor cortex.,"Auditory verbal hallucinations (AH) have long been a hallmark of schizophrenia (SZ) and are one of its major diagnostic features. They are difficult to manage with existing treatment options. Here, neurofeedback will be used to regulate the superior temporal gyrus (STG) activation which will not only lead to activation changes in the STG, but also to changes in the default mode network (DMN).

The investigators will study SZ patients with medication resistant AH in the rt-fMRI intervention arm and in the sham-rt-fMRI arm. In both arms, the task and the rt-fMRI session structure will be identical. The SZ-intervention group will receive feedback from the STG while SZ-sham group will receive feedback from the motor cortex.

They are often difficult or impossible to treat with existing methods. This study will test the use of real-time fMRI neurofeedback to mitigate auditory verbal hallucinations in patients whose hallucinations are resistant to medication. Half of the patients will receive real time fMRI neurofeedback from a brain region involved in auditory hallucinations and half will receive it from motor cortex. Auditory verbal hallucinations (AH) have long been a hallmark of schizophrenia (SZ) and are one of its major diagnostic features. They are difficult to manage with existing treatment options. Here, neurofeedback will be used to regulate the superior temporal gyrus (STG) activation which will not only lead to activation changes in the STG, but also to changes in the default mode network (DMN). The investigators will study SZ patients with medication resistant AH in the rt-fMRI intervention arm and in the sham-rt-fMRI arm.

National Cancer Institute (NCI),NIH,NCT00043979,Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With High-Risk and Recurrent Pediatric Sarcomas,Pilot Study of Allogeneic/Syngeneic Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With High-Risk and Recurrent Pediatric Sarcomas,"This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplantation for treating patients with sarcomas (tumors of the bone, nerves, or soft tissue). Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow and blood stream that develop into blood cells. Stem cells transplanted from a healthy donor travel to the patient's bone marrow and begin producing normal cells. In patients with certain cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, the donor's immune cells attack the patient's cancer cells in what is called a ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect, contributing to cure of the disease. This study will determine whether this treatment can be used successfully to treat patients with sarcomas.

Patients between 4 and 35 years of age with a sarcoma that has spread from the primary site or cannot be removed surgically, and for whom effective treatment is not available, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have been diagnosed by the age of 30 at the time of enrollment. They must have a matched donor (usually a sibling). Participants undergo the following procedures:

Donors: Stem cells are collected from the donor. To do this, the hormone granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the cells are collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the stem cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm.

Patients: For patients who do not already have a central venous catheter (plastic tube), one is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body the entire treatment period for giving medications, transfusing blood, , withdrawing blood samples, and delivering the donated stem cells. Before the transplant procedure, patients receive from one to three cycles of ""induction"" chemotherapy, with each cycle consisting of 5 days of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by at least a 17-day rest period. All the drugs are infused through the catheter except prednisone, which is taken by mouth. After the induction therapy, the patient is admitted to the hospital for 5 days of chemotherapy with high doses of cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and fludarabine. Two days later, the stem cells are infused. The anticipated hospital stay is about 3 weeks, but may be longer if complications arise. Patients are discharged when their white cell count is near normal, they have no fever or infection, they can take sufficient food and fluids by mouth, and they have no signs of serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-a condition in which the donor's cells ""see"" the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response against them.

After hospital discharge, patients are followed in the clinic at least once or twice weekly for a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for 100 days. They receive medications to prevent infection and GVHD and, if needed, blood transfusions. If GVHD has not developed by about 120 days post transplant, patients receive additional white cells to boost the immune response. After 100 days, follow-up visits may be less frequent. Follow-up continues for at least 5 years. During the course of the study, patients undergo repeated medical evaluations, including blood tests and radiology studies, to check on the cancer and on any treatment side effects. On four occasions, white blood cells may be collected through apheresis to see if immune responses can be generated against the sarcomas treated in this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be done on five occasions. This test uses a radioactive material to produce images useful in detecting primary tumors and cancer that has spread.","Background:

* Treatment of pediatric sarcomas has enjoyed progress in the past 25 years for patients with localized, chemosensitive disease and prognostic factors are now available to identify subsets of patients who have very dismal prognoses; patients with primary metastatic disease, especially those with bone and bone marrow metastases.
* Patients with primary chemoresistant disease and early recurrence also have very poor prognoses and lack suitable treatment options. For these patients, it is critical that alternative approaches to cytotoxic chemotherapy be identified.
* Basic laboratory studies have shown that Ewing's sarcoma is susceptible to immune mediated mechanisms of cytolysis in vitro. Interestingly, for Ewing's sarcoma this appears to be true for both chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines.
* Recent progress in the field of bone marrow transplantation has identified approaches that can reproducibly induce allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell engraftment in adults with hematologic malignancies. In some cases, this same approach has shown beneficial effects for patients with solid tumors as a result of the development of allogeneic, immune-mediated graft versus tumor effects.

Objectives:

* To determine if the transplantation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched, peripheral blood stem cells can result in full donor engraftment (greater than 95 percent by day 100) in patients with high risk-pediatric sarcomas.
* To identify and characterize the toxicities of HLA-matched peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in patients with high-risk pediatric sarcomas. In particular we will identify the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and the pace of immune reconstitution in this population.
* To determine if allogeneic graft-versus-tumor responses following allogeneic PBSCT can induce clinically significant anti-tumor effects as measured by radiographic evidence of antitumor responses following PBSCT in patients with measurable disease and improved clinical outcome compared to historical controls in this patient population with a universally poor outcome.

Eligibility:

* Patients, age of greater than 4 years at enrollment to less than 30 years at diagnosis and age less than 35 at enrollment, with ultra-high risk Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.
* Patients must have completed standard front-line therapy and salvage therapy.
* Patient must have the availability of a 5 or 6 antigen HLA-matched first-degree relative donor or a genotypically identical twin.
* Patients must have adequate cardiac, pulmonary, renal, liver, and marrow function.

Design:

-Donor will be prepared for peripheral blood stem cell harvest with Filgrastim mobilization, 10 microg/kg per day subcutaneous (SQ) for 5-7 days until they have stem cell collected by apheresis. The stem cells will then be cryopreserved.

Patients will receive 1 to 3 21 day cycles of Fludarabine-EPOCH induction chemotherapy. The preparative regimen will consist of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and melphalan followed by stem cell infusion. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of sirolimus and tacrolimus.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA: PATIENT

Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow and blood stream that develop into blood cells. Stem cells transplanted from a healthy donor travel to the patient's bone marrow and begin producing normal cells. In patients with certain cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, the donor's immune cells attack the patient's cancer cells in what is called a ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect, contributing to cure of the disease. This study will determine whether this treatment can be used successfully to treat patients with sarcomas. Patients between 4 and 35 years of age with a sarcoma that has spread from the primary site or cannot be removed surgically, and for whom effective treatment is not available, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have been diagnosed by the age of 30 at the time of enrollment. They must have a matched donor (usually a sibling). Participants undergo the following procedures: Donors: Stem cells are collected from the donor. To do this, the hormone granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the cells are collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the stem cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm. Patients: For patients who do not already have a central venous catheter (plastic tube), one is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body the entire treatment period for giving medications, transfusing blood, , withdrawing blood samples, and delivering the donated stem cells. Before the transplant procedure, patients receive from one to three cycles of ""induction"" chemotherapy, with each cycle consisting of 5 days of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by at least a 17-day rest period. All the drugs are infused through the catheter except prednisone, which is taken by mouth. After the induction therapy, the patient is admitted to the hospital for 5 days of chemotherapy with high doses of cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and fludarabine. Two days later, the stem cells are infused. The anticipated hospital stay is about 3 weeks, but may be longer if complications arise. Patients are discharged when their white cell count is near normal, they have no fever or infection, they can take sufficient food and fluids by mouth, and they have no signs of serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-a condition in which the donor's cells ""see"" the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response against them. After hospital discharge, patients are followed in the clinic at least once or twice weekly for a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for 100 days. They receive medications to prevent infection and GVHD and, if needed, blood transfusions. If GVHD has not developed by about 120 days post transplant, patients receive additional white cells to boost the immune response. After 100 days, follow-up visits may be less frequent. Follow-up continues for at least 5 years. During the course of the study, patients undergo repeated medical evaluations, including blood tests and radiology studies, to check on the cancer and on any treatment side effects. On four occasions, white blood cells may be collected through apheresis to see if immune responses can be generated against the sarcomas treated in this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be done on five occasions. This test uses a radioactive material to produce images useful in detecting primary tumors and cancer that has spread. Background: * Treatment of pediatric sarcomas has enjoyed progress in the past 25 years for patients with localized, chemosensitive disease and prognostic factors are now available to identify subsets of patients who have very dismal prognoses; patients with primary metastatic disease, especially those with bone and bone marrow metastases. * Patients with primary chemoresistant disease and early recurrence also have very poor prognoses and lack suitable treatment options. For these patients, it is critical that alternative approaches to cytotoxic chemotherapy be identified. * Basic laboratory studies have shown that Ewing's sarcoma is susceptible to immune mediated mechanisms of cytolysis in vitro. Interestingly, for Ewing's sarcoma this appears to be true for both chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines. * Recent progress in the field of bone marrow transplantation has identified approaches that can reproducibly induce allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell engraftment in adults with hematologic malignancies. In some cases, this same approach has shown beneficial effects for patients with solid tumors as a result of the development of allogeneic, immune-mediated graft versus tumor effects. Objectives: * To determine if the transplantation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched, peripheral blood stem cells can result in full donor engraftment (greater than 95 percent by day 100) in patients with high risk-pediatric sarcomas. * To identify and characterize the toxicities of HLA-matched peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in patients with high-risk pediatric sarcomas. In particular we will identify the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and the pace of immune reconstitution in this population. * To determine if allogeneic graft-versus-tumor responses following allogeneic PBSCT can induce clinically significant anti-tumor effects as measured by radiographic evidence of antitumor responses following PBSCT in patients with measurable disease and improved clinical outcome compared to historical controls in this patient population with a universally poor outcome. Eligibility: * Patients, age of greater than 4 years at enrollment to less than 30 years at diagnosis and age less than 35 at enrollment, with ultra-high risk Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. * Patients must have completed standard front-line therapy and salvage therapy. * Patient must have the availability of a 5 or 6 antigen HLA-matched first-degree relative donor or a genotypically identical twin. * Patients must have adequate cardiac, pulmonary, renal, liver, and marrow function. Design: -Donor will be prepared for peripheral blood stem cell harvest with Filgrastim mobilization, 10 microg/kg per day subcutaneous (SQ) for 5-7 days until they have stem cell collected by apheresis. The stem cells will then be cryopreserved. Patients will receive 1 to 3 21 day cycles of Fludarabine-EPOCH induction chemotherapy. The preparative regimen will consist of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and melphalan followed by stem cell infusion. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of sirolimus and tacrolimus. * INCLUSION CRITERIA: PATIENT The following diagnoses will be considered: 1.

Johns Hopkins University,OTHER,NCT02802384,Pathophysiology of Paget's Disease of Bone,Investigation of Pathophysiology of Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis in Paget's Disease of Bone,"Paget's disease of the bone is a skeletal disorder which results in increased and disorganized bone remodeling, leading to dense but fragile and expanding bones. The identified genetic causes of Paget's disease of bone only explain why bone is destroyed, but not why the bone formed in its place is abnormal.

Current treatment for people with Paget's disease of the bone is limited to patients with bone pain, thought to be related to high rate of bone turnover (breakdown and rebuilding of bone) and works by slowing down the rate of bone breakdown. The current treatment does not address the excess blood vessels and bone formed.

This research is being done to understand factors that may promote blood vessel and bone formation in Paget's disease of the bone.","The genetic mutations found in Paget's disease currently only account for about 15% of cases and are limited to genes that affect osteoclast differentiation and function. These mutations alone are insufficient to explain the full phenotype, particularly hypervascularity and increased bone formation. Through a series of basic science studies, the investigators have recently found that preosteoclasts secrete chemokines to promote migration of various stem cells, which then differentiate into osteoblasts and endothelial cells to support osteogenesis and angiogenesis, respectively.

The investigators will perform a cross sectional study of patients with active Paget's disease of bone compared to similar people without Paget's disease of bone. The goal is to enroll 10 patients with Paget's disease of the bone (cases) and 10 healthy, age- and sex-matched people (controls) whom meet similar exclusion criteria. Participants who consent to the study will undergo a brief history and physical exam, allow review of medical records relevant to their disease, and have one blood (5 tablespoons) sample drawn.

The investigators hypothesize that specific chemokine concentrations are increased in people with Paget's disease of the bone compared to controls. The investigators also hypothesize that these levels correlate with severity of disease. Therefore, the investigators primary objective is to determine if serum chemokine levels are increased in patients with Paget's disease of the bone. The secondary objective is to evaluate if the serum chemokine concentrations correlate with various markers of disease activity. Findings could aid in the clinical monitoring of patients with Paget's disease of the bone and could provide an additional therapeutic target to improve treatment of this painful disease.","Inclusion Criteria for Cases:

* Men and women between the ages of 18-99 years who have evidence of active Paget's disease of bone as clinically and/or radiographically defined by:

  * Increased serum alkaline phosphatase or increased serum collagen type 1 c-telopeptide (CTX) or increase in urinary pyridinoline at diagnosis
  * AND history of at least one of the following signs/symptoms: Pagetoid lesions(s) on x-ray/CT/MRI, increased uptake of radioactive substance by bone scan, bone pain, fracture, hearing loss, headache, hypercalcemia, or bony deformity.

Inclusion criteria for controls:

* Men and women between the ages of 18-99 years who match age within 5 years of cases and gender who do NOT have evidence of Paget's disease of bone as defined by:

  * No bone pain or bony deformity
  * Normal serum alkaline phosphatase

The identified genetic causes of Paget's disease of bone only explain why bone is destroyed, but not why the bone formed in its place is abnormal. Current treatment for people with Paget's disease of the bone is limited to patients with bone pain, thought to be related to high rate of bone turnover (breakdown and rebuilding of bone) and works by slowing down the rate of bone breakdown. The current treatment does not address the excess blood vessels and bone formed. This research is being done to understand factors that may promote blood vessel and bone formation in Paget's disease of the bone. The genetic mutations found in Paget's disease currently only account for about 15% of cases and are limited to genes that affect osteoclast differentiation and function. These mutations alone are insufficient to explain the full phenotype, particularly hypervascularity and increased bone formation. Through a series of basic science studies, the investigators have recently found that preosteoclasts secrete chemokines to promote migration of various stem cells, which then differentiate into osteoblasts and endothelial cells to support osteogenesis and angiogenesis, respectively. The investigators will perform a cross sectional study of patients with active Paget's disease of bone compared to similar people without Paget's disease of bone. The goal is to enroll 10 patients with Paget's disease of the bone (cases) and 10 healthy, age- and sex-matched people (controls) whom meet similar exclusion criteria. Participants who consent to the study will undergo a brief history and physical exam, allow review of medical records relevant to their disease, and have one blood (5 tablespoons) sample drawn. The investigators hypothesize that specific chemokine concentrations are increased in people with Paget's disease of the bone compared to controls. The investigators also hypothesize that these levels correlate with severity of disease. Therefore, the investigators primary objective is to determine if serum chemokine levels are increased in patients with Paget's disease of the bone. The secondary objective is to evaluate if the serum chemokine concentrations correlate with various markers of disease activity. Findings could aid in the clinical monitoring of patients with Paget's disease of the bone and could provide an additional therapeutic target to improve treatment of this painful disease. Inclusion Criteria for Cases: * Men and women between the ages of 18-99 years who have evidence of active Paget's disease of bone as clinically and/or radiographically defined by: * Increased serum alkaline phosphatase or increased serum collagen type 1 c-telopeptide (CTX) or increase in urinary pyridinoline at diagnosis * AND history of at least one of the following signs/symptoms: Pagetoid lesions(s) on x-ray/CT/MRI, increased uptake of radioactive substance by bone scan, bone pain, fracture, hearing loss, headache, hypercalcemia, or bony deformity. Inclusion criteria for controls: * Men and women between the ages of 18-99 years who match age within 5 years of cases and gender who do NOT have evidence of Paget's disease of bone as defined by: * No bone pain or bony deformity * Normal serum alkaline phosphatase Exclusion Criteria: * Osteosarcoma or other blastic bony metastases alone * Fibrous dysplasia of bone * Hyperostosis frontalis interna * All men and women \< 18 years or \> 99 years * Pregnancy (women) determined by self-report * Current use of oral contraceptive tablets or Depo-Provera™ (women) * Current use of hormone replacement therapy * Creatinine clearance \< 60 ml/min./1.73 m2 by Cockcroft-Gault based on most recent serum creatinine level (if greater than 1 year since last assessment, will be measured on collected blood sample to verify eligibility) * Current smoking or tobacco use * Alcohol use greater than 3 units daily * Use of thiazolidinediones within the last year * Use of medications known to impact bone and mineral metabolism, including use of a bisphosphonate in the last 11 months; ever use of teriparatide or denosumab; use of calcitonin, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), or estrogen within the past 6 months, prednisone \> 5 mg for over 10 days in the last three months, anti-epileptic medications (e.g. phenytoin, carbamezapine, phenobarbitol, and primidone); current or use within the past year of aromatase inhibitors; leuprolide; histrelin * History of a thyroid problem that is currently uncontrolled as defined by most recent thyroid stimulating hormone levels \< 0.1 microIU/mL (if greater than 6 months since last assessment, will be measured on collected blood sample to verify eligibility) * Other known metabolic or structural bone disease other than low bone density (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, multiple myeloma, sarcoid or other granulomatous disease, celiac disease, osteopetrosis, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica) * Other significant medical illness (heart disease, pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy other than ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or non-melanoma skin cancer, rheumatologic conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, renal disease requiring dialysis, etc.) * Inability to understand and provide informed consent."

University College Dublin,OTHER,NCT02550379,Emotion Recognition Training for Young People,Emotion Recognition Training for Socially Anxious Adolescents: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"While it has been hypothesised that individuals who experience social anxiety are more likely to misread facial emotions as threatening or disapproving, researchers have proposed that the difficulty may lie in decoding ambiguous facial expressions rather than identifying emotions which are expressed with greater intensity. Emotion recognition (ER) training provides a promising new avenue of research which may be beneficial in altering emotion processing biases which maintain or increase symptoms of mental health disorders. This study will examine the effectiveness of ER training in a community-based sample of young people (15-18 years) who report high levels of social anxiety. The intervention aims to alter emotion processing biases through a training procedure designed to promote the perception of happiness over disgust in ambiguous facial expressions which we hypothesise will subsequently reduce symptoms of social anxiety.

The study design consists of two phases. During Phase 1 participants will complete a screening questionnaire. This questionnaire will include a measure of the affective, cognitive, and behavioural components of social anxiety in adolescence. Depending on their suitability (i.e. scoring above a cut-off on a standardised measure of social anxiety in Phase 1 of the study), participants may then be invited to take part in a 4-day computer-based emotion recognition training programme (Phase 2). The purpose of this phase is to see if ER training will help young people feel less worried or nervous in social situations by training them to interpret ambiguous facial expressions as expressing a positive emotion (happy rather than disgusted).

Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or placebo (inactive) group. Both groups will be asked to complete a 4-day programme involving one computer training session per day (each session takes approximately 20 minutes). Questionnaires will also be given to participants to complete before and after the intervention, along with a 2-week follow-up assessment. These will include questionnaires to measure social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fear of negative evaluation. Each questionnaire will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants will not know whether they have received the intervention or placebo training until after the intervention.","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is among the most prevalent mental disorders in adolescence, 10% of females and 5% of males are diagnosed with SAD in adolescence. SAD is characterised by marked fear or anxiety about social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. SAD is associated with social isolation, poor social skills, low self-esteem, and future comorbid mental disorders. Social anxiety typically develops during adolescence, thus there is a need to detect and treat it early prior to the development of a clinically-diagnosed SAD. Most early interventions for social anxiety have used Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which focuses on modifying explicit verbal cognitions. However, many adolescents do not have access to CBT and many finding it demanding.

Research suggests that individuals who have high levels of social anxiety are more likely to misread facial emotions as threatening or disapproving, and researchers have proposed that the difficulty may lie in decoding low intensity facial expressions rather than identifying facial emotions which are expressed with greater intensity. In social anxiety, a bias towards perceiving ambiguous facial expressions as negative may give rise to avoidant behaviour and maintain or increase symptoms; therefore, this emotion processing bias may be a powerful bias for researchers to target with the aim of developing interventions to reduce symptoms.

ER training provides a promising new line of research which may be beneficial in altering emotion processing biases which maintain or increase symptoms of mental health disorders. Research has shown that ER training may be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in analogue populations with high levels of depression and anger and aggressive behaviour in healthy adults and adolescent youth at high risk of criminal offending and delinquency.

Present Study:

This research tests the effectiveness of ER training in reducing social anxiety in adolescents. Given that the age of onset of social anxiety is adolescence, peaking in late teens, this research focuses on 15-18 year olds.

Aims \& Objectives:

To test the effectiveness of ER training in reducing social anxiety in adolescents. The intervention aims to alter emotion processing biases through a training procedure designed to promote the perception of happiness over disgust in ambiguous facial expressions which we hypothesise will subsequently reduce symptoms of social anxiety.

Central Research Questions:

Is ER training associated with:

I. An increase in the perception of positive (happy) over negative (disgust) emotions in faces displaying ambiguous emotional expressions? II. A decrease in negative evaluations? III. A decrease in social anxiety? IV. A decrease in other forms of anxiety and/or symptoms of depression?

PHASE 1: SCREENING FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY IN ADOLESCENTS Objective: To screen for sub-clinical levels of social anxiety in adolescents. School Sampling: Approximately 8 large second-level schools in Dublin will be randomly selected from the Department of Education and Skills 2012 published list of schools.

Power Analysis: Using G\*Power 3.1, the sample size was determined as 111 based on the following parameters: a medium effect size of 0.3, alpha of 0.05, power of 0.8, a repeated measures within-between interaction: 2 (Randomization) X 3 (Pre, Post, Follow-up).

Participants: Adolescents aged 15-18 years in second-level schools will be invited for the initial screening.

Procedure: Adolescents must return parental and informed consent forms. Participants will be screened using the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C). Participants scoring above the cut-off of ≥18 will be invited to participate in the intervention (Phase 2).

Approximately 440 second-level students across 8 schools will be invited to complete screening. With an approximate response rate of 50% (N=220), and using a cut-off of ≥18 120 will be identified (60 per condition).

PHASE 2: RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL Objective: To compare the effectiveness of ER to placebo training in reducing social anxiety.

Participants: Adolescents from Phase 1 screening above a cut-off of ≥18 will be invited to participate in the intervention and will be randomly assigned to ER/placebo training. On the basis of screening, the PI will ensure group equivalence across ER versus placebo groups on key variables (e.g., age, gender, social anxiety) in advance of randomization. Post randomization, independent variables will be checked to ensure they are balanced across groups so as not to contaminate outcomes of the study.

Procedure:

Participants in both ER and placebo training groups will receive 4 training sessions over 4 consecutive days. The intervention will be performed on a laptop during school and delivered in a quiet room with the researcher present. Pre-intervention data will be collected on day 1 prior to training, post-intervention data will be collected on day 4 following training, with a follow-up assessment at 2-weeks post-intervention.

Training Task:

Participants will complete training over 4 consecutive days in schools. Each session will include a computerised training programme comprised of three phases, baseline, training, and test,which will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. A follow-up assessment will be completed two weeks post-intervention. During the 2-week follow-up assessment participants will complete a final assessment of emotion sensitivity using the test phase of the emotion recognition task.

* Prototypical 'happy' and 'disgust' composite images generated from 40 individual faces (20 x male, 20 x female) showing a disgust facial expression, and the same 40 individuals showing a happy expression.
* Prototypical images used as endpoints to generate a linear morph sequence that consists of images that change incrementally from unambiguously 'happy' to unambiguous 'disgust', with emotionally ambiguous images in the middle. The proposed research will include a sequence with 15 equally spaced images for each gender (male and female) for use as experimental stimuli.
* Previous research by the University of Bristol has used stimuli portraying male faces only. The task stimuli for the current research will be matched to the participant's gender, i.e. female participants will complete a task which will include female face stimuli and male participants will complete a task which will include male face stimuli.
* Baseline and test phases will consist of 45 trials, in which each of the stimuli from the morph sequence will be presented to the participant three times. The task will require the participant to make a forced choice judgement as to whether each face is displaying a happy or disgust expression. Images will be presented one at a time, in random order, for 150 milliseconds. Stimuli will be preceded by a fixation cross, which will be presented for a random period ranging from 1500 to 2500 milliseconds. Subsequent to presentation, and to prevent processing of after images, a backward mask of noise will be presented for 250 milliseconds, followed by a prompt asking the participant to respond. This will remain on screen until the participant makes response (i.e., a judgement of 'happy' or 'disgust').
* Trials in the training phase will be similar to trials in the baseline and test phases with respect to inter-trial interval and stimuli presentation, but with the addition of feedback subsequent to the participant's response. In the placebo condition, feedback will be based on the participant's baseline balance point. That is, responses will be classified as 'correct' if the participant identified images below the original balance point image as 'disgust' and above it as 'happy', and otherwise are classified as 'incorrect'. Feedback will be a message saying 'Correct / Incorrect! That face was disgust/happy'. In the training condition, feedback will be again based on the participant's baseline balance point, but the 'correct' classification will be shifted two morph steps towards the 'disgust' end of the continuum, so that the two images nearest the balance point that the participant would previously have classified as 'disgust' at baseline will be considered 'happy' when providing feedback. In each training block, each face from the 15 face continuum will be presented twice. The order of presentation will be randomized within each block. Three training blocks will be given to each participant, resulting in 90 training trials per session and a total of 360 training trials in total.

Outcome Measures:

Outcome measure will be administered to all participants in the RCT pre-intervention (baseline on day 1), post-intervention (day 4), and at 2-week follow-up, including:

Emotion Sensitivity Measurement Accuracy assessed using baseline and test measurements at each ER/placebo training session.

Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C) The SPAI-C is a 26-item self-report instrument and has good psychometric properties with adolescent samples. The SPAI-C measures the somatic, cognitive, and behavioural aspects of social phobia in children and adolescents. Questions relate to how nervous the respondent feels when carrying out certain tasks and responses are rated on a 3-point scale from never, or hardly ever to most of the time, or always with higher scores indicating greater levels of social anxiety.

Brief Fear of Negative Evaluations Scale - Revised (BFNE-R) Negative evaluations are an important aspect of social anxiety. The BFNE-R is a 12-item measure which assesses fear of negative evaluation. Items are responded to on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4. The BFNE-R has shown high internal consistency and correlates well with the original BFNE.

Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) Child Version The SCARED is used to screen for signs of anxiety disorders. The 41-item measure is used to measure anxiety, including panic, separation anxiety, generalised anxiety, social avoidance, and school phobia. It has shown high reliability with adolescents. Items are rated on a 3-point Likert scale. Internal consistencies have been shown to be high with adolescent samples.

Depression Subscale of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) The RCADS is a 47-item self-report measure and has good psychometric properties with adolescent samples. The Depression Subscale contains 10 items. Items relating to the frequency with which depressive symptoms are experienced are rated on a 4-point Likert scale.

University of Southern California,OTHER,NCT01759979,Laser Versus Mechanical Lithotripsy of Bile Duct Stones,Randomized Trial of Combination of Cholangioscopic Guided Laser Lithotripsy and Conventional Mechanical Versus Conventional Mechanical Methods for the Endoscopic Removal of Large Bile Duct Stones,"Very large bile duct stones are difficult to remove. The prefered method involves an endoscopic procedure known as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)performed using a special side viewing endoscope. In the past small baskets passed through the scope into the bile duct have been used to remove most stones using mechanical force.

Recently very small scopes known as cholangioscope have been introduced through the side viewing endoscope directly into the bile duct. These cholangioscopes may be used to guide laser therapy of bile duct stones. The investigators suspect that stone destruction using cholangioscopy guided laser stone destruction may enable bile duct stones to be removed more quickly and safely when added to the mechanical techniques.","TITLE: Randomized trial of combination of cholangioscopic guided laser lithotripsy and conventional mechanical versus conventional mechanical methods for the endoscopic removal of large bile duct stones

STUDY ARMS: Laser guided lithotripsy and conventional methods vs conventional methods alone alone

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES: Large bile duct stones are challenging to remove at time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and classically have required the utilization of mechanical baskets and balloons. These maneuvers may be associated with bile duct trauma, bleeding, pancreatitis, and the requirement for additional procedures. Many patients require multiple sessions using conventional mechanical approaches. A recent prospective audit of patients undergoing ERCP during the past year at LAC+USC Medical Center indicates that of approximately 500 procedures more than 250 were for bile duct stones and 100 (40%) required multiple procedures and stent placement. Scheduling challenges and limited resources make it difficult for many of these patients to return for stent changes and increases the risk of complications including cholangitis.

Cholangioscopy enables therapeutic intervention including intracorporeal electro-hydraulic and laser lithotripsy for biliary stone disease with favorable efficacy and safety. Direct visualization by cholangioscopy minimizes the risk of laser related bile duct injury and is potentially much less traumatic and more efficacious than traditional mechanical approaches.

A recent 15 center prospective clinical cohort study demonstrated a high success rate, 89%, and low rate of complications, 7.5%, for the single user cholangioscopy system. In a group of patients who underwent stone removal using the cholangioscope introduced laser or electrohydraulic systems the success even higer 92% and complications potentially lower. Available literature indicates that in cases in which ERCP with mechanical lithotripsy is required the complication rate is approximately 5-12% and risk of cholangitis is 1.4-4%. If ERCP is performed with laser lithotripsy in addition to conventional mechanical methods the complications rate is 6.1% and risk of cholangitis is 2.4%. Cholangioscopy guided laser treatment to enhance stone removal is currently widely used by gastroenterologists at academic centers including the hospitals of the University of Southern California as well as in leading community centers such as the Kaiser Permanente Hospitals of Southern California. While it is a standard of care procedures for large bile duct stones studies directly comparing its efficacy to traditional mechanical approaches are needed.

The long term goal of this project is to assess whether the addition of cholangioscopy guided laser lithotripsy facilitates the removal of large bile duct stones at time of ERCP. Previous prospective studies have demonstrated that the technology is safe and method feasible.

The goal of this pilot study will be to determine the effect size of the difference between laser lithotripsy vs currently available methods on stone removal with the aim of estimating sample size for a fully powered randomized trial. Additional aims will be to assess for procedure duration, cost, and the number of additional procedures required for stone clearance. Complications, hospitalization related to stent dysfunction (frequently placed between lithotripsy sessions), and eventual need for surgery will also be outcomes. Healing time and time prior to return to work will also be outcomes.

OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE: This is a pilot project to measure the effect of cholangioscopy guided laser lithotripsy in addition to the currently available methods. Large multicenter prospective studies have already demonstrated that the technique is safe and feasible. The overall aims are to assess whether laser lithotripsy combined with conventional methods enhances the rate, efficacy, and cost of stone removal compared to conventional methods including mechanical lithotripsy.

STUDY DESIGN: The study will be a prospective single blind randomized control trial. All patients presenting with choledocholithiasis will be considered for the study. If their ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates a large stone (\>1cm) or biliary dilatation (\>1cm) and they do not fulfill the exclusion criterion they will be consented for the study. Randomization will be stratified based on whether or not the procedure is a first or repeat ERCP.

At that point the full time study coordinator will use a computer generated randomization schedule with concealed allocation to generate a 2:1 assignment (laser versus conventional).

At the time of the cholangiogram, which is done immediately prior to stone removal, an assessment will be made by the attending endoscopist to confirm that the stone is greater than 1cm in size.

If confirmed, stone removal will then be attempted using laser lithotripsy using a holmium probe introduced using a single operator cholangioscopy system versus conventional methods. Conventional methods including mechanical baskets and balloon may also be used to remove debris following laser lithotripsy in the laser lithotripsy group. The cholangioscope will not be introduced in those randomized to mechanical lithotripsy and conventional methods alone will be employed. Stents will be placed at the discretion of the attending endoscopist in both groups.

Multiple ERCP procedures may be required to remove the stones. Patients will remain in their assigned treatment groups during subsequent studies. Whether the stones can be successfully removed by the end of the course of therapy and the number of ERCP required for stone clearance are outcomes of interest.

The patients will be blinded to whether or not the cholangioscope was used.

The patient will be followed clinically by the principal investigator assisted by a full time study coordinator daily on the inpatient basis and by a bimonthly phone call on the outpatient basis until 2 months after complete clearance of stones from the bile duct has been confirmed.

DEVICE INFORMATION: The following devices will be used:

Spyglass Direct Visualization System Coherent Holmium Laser VP

Spyglass Direct Visualization System is made by Boston Scientific and the Coherent Holmium Laser VP are produced by Convergent Laser Technologies but is rented by Mobile Med.

All devices used in the study are approved by the FDA for this indication.

SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS

See Inclusion/Exclusion Criterion

STRATIFICATION/DESCRIPTIVE FACTORS/RANDOMIZATION SCHEME

Patient will be stratified by whether or not they have undergone a prior ERCP or whether the procedure in question is their first ERCP.

The descriptive factors that will be recorded for each patient enrolled in the study include: age, race, gender, and comorbidities at time of presentation.

Following stratification by whether or not they have undergone an ERCP, a computer generated randomized schedule with concealed allocation will generate a 2:1 assignment for the patient, placing them into either the intervention arm (laser lithotripsy using a holmium probe introduced using a single operator cholangioscopy system) or the control arm (conventional methods). As this is a pilot study, designed to gauge the extent of treatment effect and power a larger study 60 patients will be enrolled.

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY AND SAFETY

Side effects/Toxicities to be monitored.

Patients in either group may develop post procedure pain, pancreatitis, cholangitis, bile duct injury, or bleeding.

Adverse Event Reporting:

All adverse events will be reported to the principal investigator. The study physicians and coordinator will meet monthly to review these. Adverse events will be reported to the IRB, Data Monitoring Committee, and included in publications.

Data Monitoring Committee:

The study physicians and coordinator will meet monthly to review any adverse events. After no more than 50 patients have been collected all data will be reviewed by a monitoring board including the PI, coinvestigators, study coordinator, and two senior physicians who are part of the clinical gastroentrology faculty

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS

Endpoint Definitions The principle endpoint will be the endoscopic clearance of ductal stones during the course of therapy. Secondary endpoints will be to assess for procedure duration, cost, and the number of procedures required for stone clearance. Complications, hospitalization related to stent dysfunction (frequently placed between lithotripsy sessions), and need for bile duct surgery will also be endpoints.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Descriptive statistics will be performed for all patient characteristics and pre-treatment clinical measures, and comparisons between groups made to ensure balanced. Any variables significantly different between groups will be included in further models as covariates. Intent to treat will be tested for the primary outcome of clearance of ductal strons will be tested using Fisher's exact chi-squared to compare the rate of clearance between groups. Results from this test will allow for estimation of sample size for a fully powered clinical trial. This same method will be used to test dichotomous secondary outcomes: hospitalization related to stent dysfunction and further bile duct surgery. Other secondary aims, which include the count of complications, healing time, and time prior to returning to work will be tested using Poission regression. Total cost will be compared using independent t-tests. Alpha = 0.05 for all analyses. Additionally, because this is a pilot study, effect sizes will be computed to determine potential clinical relevance of outcomes. Statistical analyses will be performed by biostatisticians at the Biostatistical and Bioinformatics Resource Group within the SC CTSI.","Inclusion Criteria:

The prefered method involves an endoscopic procedure known as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)performed using a special side viewing endoscope. In the past small baskets passed through the scope into the bile duct have been used to remove most stones using mechanical force. Recently very small scopes known as cholangioscope have been introduced through the side viewing endoscope directly into the bile duct. These cholangioscopes may be used to guide laser therapy of bile duct stones. The investigators suspect that stone destruction using cholangioscopy guided laser stone destruction may enable bile duct stones to be removed more quickly and safely when added to the mechanical techniques. TITLE: Randomized trial of combination of cholangioscopic guided laser lithotripsy and conventional mechanical versus conventional mechanical methods for the endoscopic removal of large bile duct stones STUDY ARMS: Laser guided lithotripsy and conventional methods vs conventional methods alone alone BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES: Large bile duct stones are challenging to remove at time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and classically have required the utilization of mechanical baskets and balloons. These maneuvers may be associated with bile duct trauma, bleeding, pancreatitis, and the requirement for additional procedures. Many patients require multiple sessions using conventional mechanical approaches. A recent prospective audit of patients undergoing ERCP during the past year at LAC+USC Medical Center indicates that of approximately 500 procedures more than 250 were for bile duct stones and 100 (40%) required multiple procedures and stent placement. Scheduling challenges and limited resources make it difficult for many of these patients to return for stent changes and increases the risk of complications including cholangitis. Cholangioscopy enables therapeutic intervention including intracorporeal electro-hydraulic and laser lithotripsy for biliary stone disease with favorable efficacy and safety. Direct visualization by cholangioscopy minimizes the risk of laser related bile duct injury and is potentially much less traumatic and more efficacious than traditional mechanical approaches. A recent 15 center prospective clinical cohort study demonstrated a high success rate, 89%, and low rate of complications, 7.5%, for the single user cholangioscopy system. In a group of patients who underwent stone removal using the cholangioscope introduced laser or electrohydraulic systems the success even higer 92% and complications potentially lower. Available literature indicates that in cases in which ERCP with mechanical lithotripsy is required the complication rate is approximately 5-12% and risk of cholangitis is 1.4-4%. If ERCP is performed with laser lithotripsy in addition to conventional mechanical methods the complications rate is 6.1% and risk of cholangitis is 2.4%. Cholangioscopy guided laser treatment to enhance stone removal is currently widely used by gastroenterologists at academic centers including the hospitals of the University of Southern California as well as in leading community centers such as the Kaiser Permanente Hospitals of Southern California. While it is a standard of care procedures for large bile duct stones studies directly comparing its efficacy to traditional mechanical approaches are needed. The long term goal of this project is to assess whether the addition of cholangioscopy guided laser lithotripsy facilitates the removal of large bile duct stones at time of ERCP. Previous prospective studies have demonstrated that the technology is safe and method feasible. The goal of this pilot study will be to determine the effect size of the difference between laser lithotripsy vs currently available methods on stone removal with the aim of estimating sample size for a fully powered randomized trial. Additional aims will be to assess for procedure duration, cost, and the number of additional procedures required for stone clearance. Complications, hospitalization related to stent dysfunction (frequently placed between lithotripsy sessions), and eventual need for surgery will also be outcomes. Healing time and time prior to return to work will also be outcomes. OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE: This is a pilot project to measure the effect of cholangioscopy guided laser lithotripsy in addition to the currently available methods. Large multicenter prospective studies have already demonstrated that the technique is safe and feasible. The overall aims are to assess whether laser lithotripsy combined with conventional methods enhances the rate, efficacy, and cost of stone removal compared to conventional methods including mechanical lithotripsy. STUDY DESIGN: The study will be a prospective single blind randomized control trial. All patients presenting with choledocholithiasis will be considered for the study. If their ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates a large stone (\>1cm) or biliary dilatation (\>1cm) and they do not fulfill the exclusion criterion they will be consented for the study. Randomization will be stratified based on whether or not the procedure is a first or repeat ERCP. At that point the full time study coordinator will use a computer generated randomization schedule with concealed allocation to generate a 2:1 assignment (laser versus conventional). At the time of the cholangiogram, which is done immediately prior to stone removal, an assessment will be made by the attending endoscopist to confirm that the stone is greater than 1cm in size. If confirmed, stone removal will then be attempted using laser lithotripsy using a holmium probe introduced using a single operator cholangioscopy system versus conventional methods. Conventional methods including mechanical baskets and balloon may also be used to remove debris following laser lithotripsy in the laser lithotripsy group. The cholangioscope will not be introduced in those randomized to mechanical lithotripsy and conventional methods alone will be employed. Stents will be placed at the discretion of the attending endoscopist in both groups. Multiple ERCP procedures may be required to remove the stones. Patients will remain in their assigned treatment groups during subsequent studies. Whether the stones can be successfully removed by the end of the course of therapy and the number of ERCP required for stone clearance are outcomes of interest. The patients will be blinded to whether or not the cholangioscope was used. The patient will be followed clinically by the principal investigator assisted by a full time study coordinator daily on the inpatient basis and by a bimonthly phone call on the outpatient basis until 2 months after complete clearance of stones from the bile duct has been confirmed. DEVICE INFORMATION: The following devices will be used: Spyglass Direct Visualization System Coherent Holmium Laser VP Spyglass Direct Visualization System is made by Boston Scientific and the Coherent Holmium Laser VP are produced by Convergent Laser Technologies but is rented by Mobile Med. All devices used in the study are approved by the FDA for this indication. SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS See Inclusion/Exclusion Criterion STRATIFICATION/DESCRIPTIVE FACTORS/RANDOMIZATION SCHEME Patient will be stratified by whether or not they have undergone a prior ERCP or whether the procedure in question is their first ERCP. The descriptive factors that will be recorded for each patient enrolled in the study include: age, race, gender, and comorbidities at time of presentation. Following stratification by whether or not they have undergone an ERCP, a computer generated randomized schedule with concealed allocation will generate a 2:1 assignment for the patient, placing them into either the intervention arm (laser lithotripsy using a holmium probe introduced using a single operator cholangioscopy system) or the control arm (conventional methods). As this is a pilot study, designed to gauge the extent of treatment effect and power a larger study 60 patients will be enrolled. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY AND SAFETY Side effects/Toxicities to be monitored. Patients in either group may develop post procedure pain, pancreatitis, cholangitis, bile duct injury, or bleeding. Adverse Event Reporting: All adverse events will be reported to the principal investigator. The study physicians and coordinator will meet monthly to review these. Adverse events will be reported to the IRB, Data Monitoring Committee, and included in publications. Data Monitoring Committee: The study physicians and coordinator will meet monthly to review any adverse events. After no more than 50 patients have been collected all data will be reviewed by a monitoring board including the PI, coinvestigators, study coordinator, and two senior physicians who are part of the clinical gastroentrology faculty CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS Endpoint Definitions The principle endpoint will be the endoscopic clearance of ductal stones during the course of therapy. Secondary endpoints will be to assess for procedure duration, cost, and the number of procedures required for stone clearance. Complications, hospitalization related to stent dysfunction (frequently placed between lithotripsy sessions), and need for bile duct surgery will also be endpoints. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Descriptive statistics will be performed for all patient characteristics and pre-treatment clinical measures, and comparisons between groups made to ensure balanced. Any variables significantly different between groups will be included in further models as covariates. Intent to treat will be tested for the primary outcome of clearance of ductal strons will be tested using Fisher's exact chi-squared to compare the rate of clearance between groups. Results from this test will allow for estimation of sample size for a fully powered clinical trial. This same method will be used to test dichotomous secondary outcomes: hospitalization related to stent dysfunction and further bile duct surgery. Other secondary aims, which include the count of complications, healing time, and time prior to returning to work will be tested using Poission regression. Total cost will be compared using independent t-tests. Alpha = 0.05 for all analyses. Additionally, because this is a pilot study, effect sizes will be computed to determine potential clinical relevance of outcomes. Statistical analyses will be performed by biostatisticians at the Biostatistical and Bioinformatics Resource Group within the SC CTSI.

United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine,FED,NCT03525184,Nutrition Intervention to Promote Immune Recovery From Sleep Restriction,Nutrition Intervention to Promote Immune Recovery From Sleep Restriction,"Physical and psychological stress on Warfighters during training and operational missions can suppress immune responsiveness. Skin wound models can be used to detect changes in immune function. Investigators have recently demonstrated that relatively modest sleep disruption degrades immune response at the site of the disrupted skin barrier and delays the initial restoration of the skin barrier. Provision of additional protein and a multi-nutrient beverage during and after sleep restriction seems to mitigate decrements in local immune function, without producing detectable effects on initial restoration of the skin barrier. However, the prior work used a parallel-group study design and inter-subject variability may have made it more difficult to detect significant differences in skin barrier restoration between participants receiving the nutrition intervention versus those receiving the placebo. Therefore, the purpose of the proposed cross-over study is to test the efficacy of a multi-nutrient beverage and additional protein (1.5 g protein per kg body weight versus 0.9 g protein per kg body weight) on immune function and the initial restoration of the skin barrier consequent to an operational stressor (i.e., 72-h sleep restriction). The effect of sleep restriction on a friend-foe marksmanship task, flow state, and measures of cognitive and neuromotor performance, will be investigated as a sub-study (Appendix A). Additionally, the effects of sleep restriction on appetite physiology, eating behaviors and intestinal permeability will be tested. Research will be conducted in a laboratory environment using male and female Soldiers from the human research participant detachment (NSRDEC), or Soldiers or civilians at NSRDEC and/or USARIEM. Participants in the study described herein (n = 20) will be exposed, in a single-blind, cross-over design to a \~72 hour normal sleep control phase, and to 2 periods of \~72 hours of sleep restriction (monitored in laboratory with \~2-h sleep per night) during which time eight blisters will be induced via suction on participant's forearm and the top layer of blisters will be removed to reveal the dermal layer of skin. In the normal sleep trial, participants will consume \~0.9 g protein per kg body weight per day and a placebo beverage during (3 days). In the first sleep restriction trial, participants will consume \~0.9 g protein per kg body weight per day and a placebo beverage during (3 days) and after (5 days) sleep restriction; and, in the second sleep restriction trial (after at least two weeks wash-out) participants will instead consume \~1.5 g protein per kg body weight and a multi-nutrient beverage (arginine: 20 g·d-1, glutamine: 30 g·d-1, zinc sulfate: 24 mg·d-1, vitamin C: 400 mg·d-1, vitamin D3: 800 IU·d-1 and omega-3 fatty acids: 1 g·d-1). Outcome measures include immune function (e.g., circulating markers of inflammation, cytokines at the blister site, and secretory immunoglobin A), skin barrier restoration time (by transepidermal water loss), subjective appetite ratings, appetite-mediating hormone concentrations, food preferences and cravings, gut microbiota composition, and intestinal permeability. Findings from this study will determine if a nutritional intervention attenuates the loss of immune responsiveness to a military relevant stressor (i.e., sleep restriction), and will determine the effects of acute sleep restriction on appetite, gut microbiota composition, and intestinal permeability.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Cardiac MRI is emerging as another promising test because it gives very precise information on heart function and the amount of scarring in the muscle. Heart failure patients are increasingly being sent for cardiac MRI but the potential advantage that this test offers over others such as echo has not been fully explored.

The purpose of this study is to determine if cardiac MRI provides more information on the cause of heart failure than traditional tests such as echo. In addition, if the information provided by this test always leads to an overall improvement in a patient's heart condition over time.

This is a randomized study where subjects referred for clinically indicated heart failure workup to determine the best clinical management will undergo standard heart failure testing (including echo) OR standard testing PLUS cardiac MRI.","Primary objective: to compare the effect of routine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) versus standard care (i.e. echocardiography with only selective use of CMR) on the etiological diagnosis in patients with a non-ischemic heart failure (HF). The proposed categories of HF to be considered in this study include: idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, inflammatory, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), ischemic cardiomyopathy, mixed etiology and other (eg. pericardial, congenital, non-compaction, right ventricular failure).

Primary hypothesis: Routine use of CMR (vs. selective use) will lead to a more specific diagnostic characterization of the underlying etiology of non-ischemic heart failure. This will lead to a reduction in the diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and HFPEF.

Secondary objectives: Determine the effects that routine use of CMR in non-ischemic HF has on therapeutic decisions, on the Composite Clinical Endpoint (CCE), cardiac function, symptoms, quality of life (QoL), and costs. Ancillary measurements will include the safety of imaging tests and adverse reactions to gadolinium contrast agent.

Secondary hypothesis: Routine use of CMR will have significant impact on treatment decisions, (1) lead to more disease specific therapies and/or (2) cause a significant change in the number and class of HF meds, during follow-up. The routine CMR group will also have improved clinical outcomes (CCE), symptoms and QoL and decreased costs to the standard of care group during follow-up.

Methods: Randomized controlled trial comparing i) routine CMR vs. ii) echocardiography with selective CMR in patient with HF due to NICM and/or HFPEF.

Among patients enrolled in Level I of IMAGE-HF, it is expected that 504 will have known NICM (or strongly suspected based on young age, absent risk factors and presenting history) and/or HFPEF.

Consecutive patients will be enrolled at sites with dedicated CMR programs (defined as minimum 200 cases/year and maximum 2 weeks waiting time in the majority of patients) and randomized to routine CMR or selective CMR. Non-ischemic HF patients from sites without dedicated CMR programs will be included in a registry of patients undergoing routine HF care (i.e. selective use of CMR). Participants in the selective CMR arm may ONLY undergo CMR for a suspicion of: 1) infiltrative myocardial disease, 2) arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 3) adult congenital heart disease or 4) pericardial disease following standard HF care including echocardiography.

University of Giessen,OTHER,NCT03365479,Acute Response of Iloprost Inhalation Using the Breelib Nebulizer in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,Acute Hemodynamic Response of Iloprost Inhalation Using the Breelib Nebulizer in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"Primary objective

• To evaluate the effect of rapid inhalation of 2.5μgiloprost using the Breelib nebulizer on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension

Secondary objectives

* To evaluate the effect of rapid iloprost inhalation using the Breelib nebulizer on mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), systemic blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP).
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the rapid iloprost inhalation using the Breelib nebulizer.","This study aims to investigate the acute hemodynamic and pharmacological effects of a single inhalation of Iloprost (2.5μg) during right heart catheterization (RHC) using the Breelib nebulizer. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH = WHO group 1), NYHA functional class III and with stable background pulmonary vasoactive treatment or treatment naïve PAH patients will be challenged with the iloprost inhalation dosage during RHC. As a proof-of concept design, the study will include consecutive PAH patients only challenged with a single administration of inhaled iloprost 2.5 μg delivered via Breelib nebulizer during right heart catheterization (day 2).

The acute hemodynamic response will be followed over 30 minutes. Change of pulmonary hemodynamics, systemic blood pressure, right ventricular echocardiographic parameters and adverse events will be assessed at baseline and 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes after the end of inhalation.

Recently, the Breelib nebulizer has been evaluated within a multicenter, randomized, unblinded, study. This safety and feasibility study compared inhalation time, pharmacokinetics, and acute tolerability of inhaled iloprost delivered via Breelib versus the standard I-Neb nebulizer. The primary safety endpoints (AEs) were reported with a low frequency and were consistent with the known safety profile of iloprost. Median inhalation times were considerably shorter while maximum iloprost plasma concentration and systemic exposure were significantly higher, with Breelib versus I-Neb. Previously, it was shown that the acute hemodynamic response of iloprost inhalation via the previous used I-Neb nebulizer resulted in a relevant and significant reduction of PVR and increase in CI. Moreover, previous generation of nebulizers also resulted in a significant reduction of PVR and increase in CI 5-15min after iloprost inhalation.

Therefore, the aim of the current study is to determine the acute hemodynamic effects on the pulmonary and the systemic circulation as well as on the gas exchange of 2.5 μg iloprost delivered via the Breelib device. The investigators aim to characterize the hemodynamic profile of the inhalation with Breelib as the investigators speculate that the shortened inhalation time will result in an enhanced hemodynamic response with substantial reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Moreover, as a secondary outcome measurement the investigators aim to assess the response of mean pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac index/cardiac output, systemic blood pressure, right ventricular echocardiographic parameters and oxygen saturation after inhalation of 2.5μg iloprost and analyze adverse events.","Inclusion Criteria:

Meir Medical Center,OTHER,NCT01191879,A Comparison of p53-induced Genes Activation in Patients With and Without Acute Myocardial Infarction,A Comparison of p53-induced Genes Activation as Possible Markers Differentiating Between Patients Presenting With Acute Myocardial Infarction and Controls,The purpose of this study is to compare p53-induced genes activation as possible markers differentiating between patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and controls.,"The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is based on the rise of bio-markers for cardiac necrosis such as troponin. While troponin measurement is highly sensitive for myocardial necrosis it has several limitations that influence its clinical use. First, since the troponin test is reliable only after 4-6 hours from symptoms onset, it has only limited value in the assessment of patients presenting earlier. Second, several clinical situations, most commonly renal dysfunction, are associated with increased troponin level and therefore may decrease the specificity of the test. Third, since troponin rise indicates myocardial infarction it is not useful in the common situations where there is myocardial ischemia without necrosis.

The P53 is a tumor suppressing gene activated in different stressful situations including hypoxia. This activation is associated with accelerated transcription (up to 30-50 folds from baseline) of different genes that are involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and in stopping the cell cycle. A study on pregnant women demonstrated high levels of fetal mRNA of these genes in maternal circulation. This gene expression correlated with other signs of fetal stress associated with hypoxia. Myocardial ischemia is another stressful event associated with tissue hypoxia. Nevertheless, the association of this gene expression with myocardial ischemia has not been investigated yet.","Inclusion Criteria:

The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is based on the rise of bio-markers for cardiac necrosis such as troponin. While troponin measurement is highly sensitive for myocardial necrosis it has several limitations that influence its clinical use. First, since the troponin test is reliable only after 4-6 hours from symptoms onset, it has only limited value in the assessment of patients presenting earlier. Second, several clinical situations, most commonly renal dysfunction, are associated with increased troponin level and therefore may decrease the specificity of the test. Third, since troponin rise indicates myocardial infarction it is not useful in the common situations where there is myocardial ischemia without necrosis. The P53 is a tumor suppressing gene activated in different stressful situations including hypoxia. This activation is associated with accelerated transcription (up to 30-50 folds from baseline) of different genes that are involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and in stopping the cell cycle. A study on pregnant women demonstrated high levels of fetal mRNA of these genes in maternal circulation. This gene expression correlated with other signs of fetal stress associated with hypoxia. Myocardial ischemia is another stressful event associated with tissue hypoxia. Nevertheless, the association of this gene expression with myocardial ischemia has not been investigated yet.

However, pancreatic surgery is still challenging due to the organ's retroperitoneal anatomy and proximity to vital vascular systems.

The integration of preoperative computed tomography-derived reconstructed images, along with augmenting the resulting 3D model during surgical procedures, holds significant potential in this context. Augmented reality-assistance systems (ARAS) have seen use in various surgical fields, including orthopedic, plastic, and neurosurgery. Nevertheless, the application of ARAS in abdominal surgery has faced challenges related to organ shifting and deformities. The retroperitoneal nature of the pancreas, characterized by minimal intraoperative organ shifts and deformations, makes pancreatic surgery a promising candidate for ARAS.

Far Eastern Memorial Hospital,OTHER,NCT04458779,Continuous Positive Airway Pressure on Acute Stroke and Obstructive Sleep Apnea,Cardiovascular Effects of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Patients With Acute Stroke and Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Stroke affects 16.9 million individuals each year and is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacologic therapy, morbidity , mortality and rates of hospitalization for stroke remain high. These data emphasize the importance of identifying all treatable conditions that could aggravate stroke. One such condition is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Sleep-related breathing disorders, including obstructive and central sleep apnea, often coexist with stroke. Compared to the general population, in whom OSA is the most common form of this breathing disorder with recent prevalence estimates of 22% of male and 17% of female , in the stroke population, the prevalence of OSA is much greater at 70% . Several randomized controlledtrials on OSA patients with stroke in acute or sub-acute stage showed that treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improved motor and functional outcomes, accelerated neurological recovery.Apart from the benefits in better neurological outcomes, secondary analyses of SAVE study suggested that CPAP treatment potentially help to reduce recurrence of stroke. Nevertheless, we don't have evidence yet from randomized control studies to prove CPAP treatment would reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.

Traditionally, recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events uses documented mortality, morbidity or hospitalization for heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or stroke as clinical endpoints. Recently, several studies showed that enlarged left atrium (LA) can serve as a predictor for recurrent stroke or cardiovascular events. On the other hand, a growing body of studies demonstrated that CPAP treatment reduce size of LA in those with OSA. Notably, all of these studies above are observational or retrospective in nature. To date, there are no prospective longitudinal randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of CPAP treatment of OSA on the change of size of LA. We therefore will undertake a randomized , controlled trial involving patients with stroke to test the primary hypothesis that treatment of OSA with CPAP would reduce the size of LA.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

1. Time from onset of stroke symptoms to hospital arrival \<2 weeks .
2. Stroke is documented with brain magnetic imaging or computed tomography

Despite advances in pharmacologic therapy, morbidity , mortality and rates of hospitalization for stroke remain high. These data emphasize the importance of identifying all treatable conditions that could aggravate stroke. One such condition is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sleep-related breathing disorders, including obstructive and central sleep apnea, often coexist with stroke. Compared to the general population, in whom OSA is the most common form of this breathing disorder with recent prevalence estimates of 22% of male and 17% of female , in the stroke population, the prevalence of OSA is much greater at 70% . Several randomized controlledtrials on OSA patients with stroke in acute or sub-acute stage showed that treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improved motor and functional outcomes, accelerated neurological recovery.Apart from the benefits in better neurological outcomes, secondary analyses of SAVE study suggested that CPAP treatment potentially help to reduce recurrence of stroke. Nevertheless, we don't have evidence yet from randomized control studies to prove CPAP treatment would reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. Traditionally, recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events uses documented mortality, morbidity or hospitalization for heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or stroke as clinical endpoints. Recently, several studies showed that enlarged left atrium (LA) can serve as a predictor for recurrent stroke or cardiovascular events. On the other hand, a growing body of studies demonstrated that CPAP treatment reduce size of LA in those with OSA. Notably, all of these studies above are observational or retrospective in nature. To date, there are no prospective longitudinal randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of CPAP treatment of OSA on the change of size of LA. We therefore will undertake a randomized , controlled trial involving patients with stroke to test the primary hypothesis that treatment of OSA with CPAP would reduce the size of LA.

"University College, London",OTHER,NCT03332979,Experiencing Loss and Planning Ahead Study,Experiencing Loss and Planning Ahead Study (ELPAS): Caring for a Relative or Friend With Dementia,"The course of dementia over many years, gradual losses and uncertain life expectancy can lead to grief amongst family and friend carers. This study aims to examine the relationship between carers' feelings of grief before the death of a person with dementia and how well carers are prepared for that death. The study involves completing questionnaires with 150 carers of people with dementia (at home or in a care home). Twenty of these carers will be purposively selected to complete additional semi-structured questions to further explore the research questions. The questionnaires will examine whether being prepared for end of life is linked to having lower levels of grief. Preparation will be measured by important factors shown in research including: knowledge of dementia progression; knowledge of the person with dementia's end of life preferences; communication with healthcare professionals; family support; and having a Power of Attorney or advance directives. The study is part of a larger study that will also involve surveys with service providers and developing a resource for carers. The study will provide important insights into how we can better support grieving carers and help them plan and prepare for end of life care.","Grief is often felt before the death of a friend or relative with dementia. Grief before the death can be triggered by losses associated with dementia causing carers to experience sorrow, anger, yearning and acceptance that can wax and wane from diagnosis to the end of life. It occurs due to the lengthy and uncertain disease trajectory; compromised communication between the person with dementia and family and friends; and changes in relationship quality and carer freedom. Between 47-71% of family and friends of people with dementia (referred here as 'carers') experience grief before the death and 20% experience complicated grief after the death. Higher grief prior to death is associated with complicated grief after death, so emotional support during care rather than solely after the death may be beneficial.

Preparation for end of life has medical, psychosocial, spiritual and practical components, including having a family member or healthcare professional to help make decisions, knowing what to expect about the terminal condition and having finances in place. Good communication with healthcare providers to discuss prognosis, treatments, cultural, spiritual and practical issues; and dealing with family conflict is critical. Preparation for end of life is associated with a lower likelihood of complicated grief in bereavement but has not been explored in the context of grief before the death. Preparation for end of life is influenced by socioeconomic factors associated with health literacy. In the UK a third of older adults have difficulty interpreting basic health information. Despite the potential benefits of end of life discussions with carers, there are many barriers to such discussions. Carers struggle to formalise in writing future wishes on behalf of the person with dementia and professionals tend to be reluctant to initiate end of life discussions. Family conflict can deter end of life decision making. Factors reflecting preparation for end of life are potentially modifiable suggesting that improving preparation could reduce grief before the death.

This study aims to examine the relationship between family and friend carers' feelings of grief before the death of a person with dementia and how well carers are prepared for that death. The hypothesis that will be tested is that modifiable factors indicating preparation for end of life are associated with lower grief before the death in carers of people with dementia. The modifiable factors reflecting preparation for end of life include: carers' having a good knowledge of dementia progression; high health literacy; a lasting (enduring) Power of Attorney; knowing the end of life wishes of the person with dementia; being satisfied with support from their social network.

Knowing which modifiable factors reflecting preparation for end of life are most closely associated with grief before the death will inform the development of a resource for carers with the potential to reduce carer distress during the lifetime of the person with dementia, bringing benefits for the person with dementia as well as their carer. It will enable discussions to ensure care at the end of life is planned and in accordance with the person's wishes; and may reduce the prevalence of complicated grief after the death of the person with dementia.

Secondary objectives are to: examine the prevalence and severity of grief before the death in carers of people with dementia; identify which modifiable factors reflecting preparation for end of life are most strongly related to grief before the death; examine the extent to which carers feel prepared for the future and end-of-life care for their relative with dementia; explore whether carers recognize grief during caring and what supports they think would be helpful; identify unmet needs for information about end of life symptoms and emotional support for carers; and explore how carers experience and cope with changes in grief over time.

This is a cross-sectional study using mixed methods. One hundred and fifty carers of people with a diagnosis of dementia will be recruited to take part in the study. They will take part in a quantitative interview with a range of questionnaires. Participants will be recruited through community and healthcare services and via the Join Dementia Research Register in the United Kingdom. Eligible carers will be sent invitations to participate. Flyers in these services or presentations at family meetings of these services are other potential avenues for recruitment. Participants will provide written consent prior to the interview.

A sub-sample of carers will be asked whether they would also like to take part in an additional qualitative semi-structured interview to enable more in-depth exploration of some of the secondary objectives. The interview will explore the dynamic and changing nature of grief over time, how carers identify with the concept of grief and whether they consider they are going through a grief experience. It will also examine what supports they have found helpful and what they perceive to be unmet information and support needs and possible programs/resources that might address these needs. Qualitative interviews will be audio-recorded with permission from the participant on an encrypted digital recorder and then transcribed verbatim by the research team. Participants will be purposively selected to take part in these interviews to provide a mix of responses representing male and female participants, adult child and spouse participants, different ethnicity as well as carers of people at different severity of dementia. We will aim to interview carers until saturation of data is reached. We envisage this will be between 15-20 carers. Once we have achieved saturation we will cease inviting carers to take part in this component of the study.

For the quantitative analysis, multivariable regression analysis will be used to explore the impact of the five modifiable factors reflecting preparation for end of life on the primary outcome of pre-death grief. We will control for potential confounding variables including: dementia severity, relationship type (spouse/partner, a child or another relationship), gender, care home status (whether or not the person with dementia is living at home or in a care home), and religiosity. There are ten potential co-variates to be included in the model. A sample of 15 participants per co-variate is preferable while ten may be sufficient. We will aim to recruit 150 participants for an adequately powered analysis.

For the qualitative analysis audio-recording will be transcribed verbatim and entered into NVivo qualitative software package (QSR International) to support data coding. Data will be thematically analysed by coding chunks of text and grouping these codes into themes and sub-themes that address the study objectives. Two researchers will independently code and analyse each interview independently and then compare codes and themes to ensure rigour in analysis. Discrepancies will be discussed until consensus on themes is reached. Interviews will be coded as collected to enable subsequent interviews to draw on and explore themes arising. While we aim to recruit carers from a mix of categories (gender, relationship type and dementia severity) we will not be able to make comparisons between groups because of the small numbers representing each group (eg there may be only one male son caring for someone with mild dementia). The themes identified will help to draw out individual experiences in relation to carer grief and access to supports to supplement and expand the quantitative data.","Inclusion Criteria:

The ByCross is a single use, disposable, minimal invasive aspiration rotational atherectomy device. The ByCross is aimed to enable effective revascularization and restore blood flow in peripheral occluded vessels. In cases that the artery is completely blocked such that opening is not possible with currently available solutions and the procedure cannot be completed, the device is capable of crossing the blocked lesion without guiding wire and enables the completion of the procedure in a safe and effective manner, thus potentially eliminating the need for open bypass surgery. The ByCross can be used in several pathologies: calcified atheroma, old and fresh thrombus.

Eligible adult patients with symptoms due to chronic sub-total and total occlusion will be enrolled and undergo percutaneous procedure including use of ByCross which will normally be followed by balloon inflation (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty) in the artery at location where blockage has been opened by ByCross to further open the artery and restore full opening, and in some case followed by placement of a stent for long term stabilization.

For demonstrating safety and effectiveness up to 42 patients will be enrolled. the procedure will take up to 2 hours followed by up to 48 hour hospitalization. Patients will then come for follow-up monitoring and examination 30 days and 6 months after procedure. Although this is unlikely, in some cases the physician can decide during procedure that following ByCross opening of the artery, ballooning or stent is not required. In this case the patient will come for another follow-up visit after 12 month.","Occlusive vascular disease (OVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the Western world. Arterial obstructions generally start as a build-up of harder atherosclerotic material on which clotted blood (thrombus) forms, whereas veins obstruction contains mostly thrombus. Over 10 million patients in the US suffer from peripheral arterial disease (PAD) including 750,000 critical limb ischemia patients who are at risk of limb amputation.

The existing pharmacological and bypass surgical methods to treat OVD are risky, expensive, and time-consuming. Overcoming these shortcomings presents a substantial opportunity for a mechanical catheter. Atherectomy with mechanical catheters has been used clinically for many years, and by now the clinical outcome of atherectomy is known as reflected by multiple clinical studies. The potential benefit of the technique compared with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and/or Stenting alone or as an adjunctive therapy has also been discussed, and more recently as an adjunctive prior to PTA with a drugeluting balloon and stenting. The existing catheters designed mainly for arteries are expensive, complicated to operate, demonstrate limited reduction in level of stenosis, might cause perforations, distal embolization and hemolysis, have no or poor aspiration, and cannot cross occlusions without passage of guidewire first. Despite the common use of these therapies and current benefits, there remain significant opportunities to extend catheter-based treatments with improved outcomes, to more patients and at lower cost.

The ByCross is a minimal invasive, single use atherectomy and thrombectomy device, which is introduced over the wire into the peripheral vasculature for revascularization of chronic occluded peripheral vessels. The ByCross has a coaxial flexible rotating shaft with an expandable tip and integrates an independent aspiration system for suction of thrombotic material. The expandable tip is an elastic arc that can bow and enlarge the tip diameter from external tip diameter of 1.7mm at closed condition to 4.7mm at open condition. As the shaft rotates, the tip breaks the calcified atheroma or thrombus into small particles, which are simultaneously aspired into the shaft and removed into the attached collection bag. The ByCross allows injection of contrast medium and thrombolytic agents through the rotating tip during the procedure for continuance imaging and prevention of appositional thrombus formation. Due to its no-symmetrical helical design the tip rotation is eccentric, causing the tip to recenter is self within the lumen as it rotates. While ByCross is introduced over a guide wire, it does not require the passage of an occlusion with the wire first. To cross the occlusion the ByCross is advanced with running motor forth and back in a closed condition. Once the occluded segment is crossed the procedure is repeated with open tip at larger diameter vessels to further remove the remaining atheroma or thrombus. The ByCross is battery powered, and includes a remote-control unit which allows the user full ergonomic control of the device next to the puncture site.

Based on compliance with standard requirements, design process and risk analysis process. The risk of occurrence of adverse events is not expected to be greater than the risk reported for other devices available in the market today. More over the past animal test supports the expected low risk. This study, aside to performance investigation, is intended to validate this. The potential significant advantage of the ByCross device in the treatment of chronic limb ischemia is the ability to cross Chronic Total Occlusion (calcified atheroma and/or thrombus, in oppose to other atherectomy devices which can only cross partial occluded vessel due to the necessity of progressing over the wire). Thus, instead of aborting the procedure, completion of revascularization procedure percutaneously is possible. In addition, the ByCross enables, due to its design, to achieve superior patency, injection of contrast medium and antiplatelet during operation of the radio-opaque tip, and enables simultaneous aspiration.

These benefits potentially reduce prolonged percutaneous procedures if other means are required to enable chroni total occlusion (CTO) passage by guidewire, and, might, in the future, reduce the number of bypass surgeries in peripheral arteries, all with no risk compared to long term clinical use of equivalent devices.

Information gathered in this study will further assure the ByCross device as superior solution enabling more beneficial minimal invasive procedure for the subjects with the same indication for treatment.

The study is multi-center, single arm, open label, prospective study. 42 patients with total or subtotal occlusion at target vessel bearing length equal to or larger than 3cm at vessels diameter of 3mm or larger will be enrolled to the study. Eligible consented subjects will undergo a procedure and treated with the ByCross device. Additional adjunctive treatment (such as PTA, stenting etc.) may be performed per physician's discretion and according to standard of care. Assessment of device safety and performance will be performed intra and post procedural, at discharge, at 30 days post procedure and at 6 months. Subjects that will undergo procedure using ByCross only with NO adjunctive therapy will be followed-up at 12 months as well. The overall duration of participation for each subject is expected to be up to 7 months and 13 months for those that undergo procedure using ByCross only.

Primary outcome measures are divided into two: performance and safety. The null hypotheses will be tested via the lower limit of the one-sided 95% exact confidence interval for the respective proportions. The expected Acute Procedural Success rate is 95% as is the rate of subjects free of device-related Major Adverse Events (MAEs) throughout a 30-day follow-up. The sample size required to achieve a lower one-sided 95% exact confidence limit that is greater than 85%, if the point estimate of the proportion is 95%, is calculated as 40 patients. To accommodate a potential 5% drop-out prior to completing 30 days follow-up, up to 42 patients may be required to be enrolled.","Inclusion Criteria:

The ByCross is a single use, disposable, minimal invasive aspiration rotational atherectomy device. The ByCross is aimed to enable effective revascularization and restore blood flow in peripheral occluded vessels. In cases that the artery is completely blocked such that opening is not possible with currently available solutions and the procedure cannot be completed, the device is capable of crossing the blocked lesion without guiding wire and enables the completion of the procedure in a safe and effective manner, thus potentially eliminating the need for open bypass surgery. The ByCross can be used in several pathologies: calcified atheroma, old and fresh thrombus. Eligible adult patients with symptoms due to chronic sub-total and total occlusion will be enrolled and undergo percutaneous procedure including use of ByCross which will normally be followed by balloon inflation (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty) in the artery at location where blockage has been opened by ByCross to further open the artery and restore full opening, and in some case followed by placement of a stent for long term stabilization. For demonstrating safety and effectiveness up to 42 patients will be enrolled. the procedure will take up to 2 hours followed by up to 48 hour hospitalization. Patients will then come for follow-up monitoring and examination 30 days and 6 months after procedure. Although this is unlikely, in some cases the physician can decide during procedure that following ByCross opening of the artery, ballooning or stent is not required. In this case the patient will come for another follow-up visit after 12 month. Occlusive vascular disease (OVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the Western world. Arterial obstructions generally start as a build-up of harder atherosclerotic material on which clotted blood (thrombus) forms, whereas veins obstruction contains mostly thrombus. Over 10 million patients in the US suffer from peripheral arterial disease (PAD) including 750,000 critical limb ischemia patients who are at risk of limb amputation.

Federico II University,OTHER,NCT06757179,The ELYAR (Elysium Against Rhinitis) Project,"Evaluation of the Therapeutic Effect of a Formulation Based on Mullein, Thyme, Propolis, and Long-Chain Polyphosphates in Children Diagnosed with Acute Rhinitis","Acute rhinitis is an inflammatory process that primarily affects the nasal mucosa, with a high incidence in the pediatric population and a morbidity rate of 6-8 episodes annually during the first two years of schooling (1). It is one of the most common conditions causing discomfort and debilitation in children, compromising their quality of life, negatively affecting social interactions, school performance, and sleep quality. In most cases, the origin is viral and the course is seasonal, with higher incidence in the autumn and winter seasons (1).

More than 100 viral strains are known to be responsible for this condition, among which Rhinoviruses are considered the most widespread and contagious (2). Symptoms, which typically begin 1-2 days after infection, include nasal congestion, nasal breathing obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, coughing, headache, malaise, and sometimes mild fever, with complete remission generally occurring within 8-10 days (2).

The therapeutic approach is exclusively symptomatic, mainly aimed at reducing nasal obstruction. Literature indicates that nasal irrigation with saline solution is the most useful treatment for cleansing the nasal passages, thinning nasal secretions, and allowing for easier elimination; in the presence of fever, antipyretics may be useful (3).

Given these premises, the aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an isotonic saline solution containing mullein, thyme, propolis, and long-chain polyphosphates, which are known for their natural properties to promote nasal secretion fluidity, reduce inflammation, and improve the functionality of the upper respiratory mucosa (4). In addition, more recent pre-clinical data suggested that this formulation exerts an antiviral action characterized by inhibition of virus replication (Rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2) and an anti-inflammatory action through modulation of NF-Kb signaling in cultured human nasal respiratory epithelial cells.

German Research Foundation,OTHER,NCT01654679,Impact of Preoperative Local Water-Filtered Infrared-A (wIRA) Irradiation on Postoperative Wound Healing,Impact of Preoperative Local Water-Filtered Infrared-A (wIRA) Irradiation on Postoperative Wound Healing - A Randomized Patient- and Observer Blinded Controlled Clinical Trial,"The purpose of this study is to dermine whether local-water filtered infrared-A (wIRA) irradiation can reduce postoperative wound infection. wIRA irradiation is applied 20min directly preoperatively, before patients underwent abdominal surgery. The wIRA is a harmless light source, that has been described before. We test the impact and clinical outcome of patients undergoing a one-time preoperative wIRA irradiation on postoperative wound healing.","Wound healing is a complex pathophysiological process that is related to pain, discomfort and immobility of patients and when not well controlled may lead to devastating and morbidity related wound infections. Furthermore, prolonged hospital stay, increased pain and consecutive increased drug consumption is often associated with postoperative wound infections. Although the average costs of wound infections are difficult to assess, there is no doubt that a prophylactic tool in controlling postoperative wound healing would have tremendous potential. Recent studies indicate that the application of different forms of thermal energy to the skin surface decreases postoperative wound infections significantly. It is known that high-normal arterial oxygen tension levels have decreased surgical wound infection from 11% to 5%. The application of water-filtered infrared A (wIRA) irradiation has been successfully applied in patients with ulcus cruris and superficial skin-tumors to alleviate pain and regulation of the body temperature in neonatology. The simple preoperative whole body warming for 30 min before surgery resulted in a statistically reduced occurrence of postoperative wound infections. A more recent study showed the beneficial effects of postoperative wIRA application on wound healing. The effects of wIRA leading to this success in therapy can be explained by thermal and non-thermal effects. A major advantage of the wIRA vs. the application of simple warming blankets lies upon the effective penetration of the wIRA applied energy within the deep subcutaneous tissue at depths of 2-3 cm. Further effects of the applied energy lead to vasodilation of capillaries with consecutive effective conduction of energetic blood flow into deeper tissue layers. Non-thermal effects of the wIRA application consist of direct stimulation and active immunomodulation by specialized immune cells. Furthermore, wIRA can induce protective proteins, e.g. ferritin in the skin and potentially influences common cross-talks within cells and extracellular matrices. These effects display regulatory roles in wound repair processes that may also be responsible for positive cosmetic results. More important for the clinical assessment of wound healing in the early phase of hospitalization is the effect of wIRA to significantly reduce postoperative pain. Surgery and postoperative pain evoke stress related effects that are induced by profound neuroendocrine changes in cytokine activity and related processes. Increased blood flow, due to vasodilation, helps to strongly eliminate accumulated pain mediators, lactic acid and potential bacterial toxins. The metabolism is induced and mediates also non-thermal effects such as attraction of immune cells and potential effects on nociceptors. These direct effects of wIRA can be easily followed when postoperative irradiation is performed. The problem of developing wound infections may rely within the first hours after and already during the operation, when the wound gets ""preconditioned"" with potential mediators or bacteria that may lead to postoperative encountered wound infections. A recent study indicated that immediate postoperative warming for 2 hours after hernia surgery may provide comparable benefits to seven days of warming. According to the idea of preventing deleterious preconditions in the process of wound healing, we tested here, the one time preoperative application of wIRA and its impact on postoperative wound healing and related clinical questions. Comparable to preoperative antibiotic single shot treatment we relied on the expansive impact of preoperative wIRA application.

The prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to study the effects of single time preoperative wIRA irradiation on the postoperative outcome of wound infections after visceral surgery.","Inclusion Criteria:

The wIRA is a harmless light source, that has been described before. We test the impact and clinical outcome of patients undergoing a one-time preoperative wIRA irradiation on postoperative wound healing. Wound healing is a complex pathophysiological process that is related to pain, discomfort and immobility of patients and when not well controlled may lead to devastating and morbidity related wound infections. Furthermore, prolonged hospital stay, increased pain and consecutive increased drug consumption is often associated with postoperative wound infections. Although the average costs of wound infections are difficult to assess, there is no doubt that a prophylactic tool in controlling postoperative wound healing would have tremendous potential. Recent studies indicate that the application of different forms of thermal energy to the skin surface decreases postoperative wound infections significantly. It is known that high-normal arterial oxygen tension levels have decreased surgical wound infection from 11% to 5%. The application of water-filtered infrared A (wIRA) irradiation has been successfully applied in patients with ulcus cruris and superficial skin-tumors to alleviate pain and regulation of the body temperature in neonatology. The simple preoperative whole body warming for 30 min before surgery resulted in a statistically reduced occurrence of postoperative wound infections. A more recent study showed the beneficial effects of postoperative wIRA application on wound healing. The effects of wIRA leading to this success in therapy can be explained by thermal and non-thermal effects. A major advantage of the wIRA vs. the application of simple warming blankets lies upon the effective penetration of the wIRA applied energy within the deep subcutaneous tissue at depths of 2-3 cm. Further effects of the applied energy lead to vasodilation of capillaries with consecutive effective conduction of energetic blood flow into deeper tissue layers. Non-thermal effects of the wIRA application consist of direct stimulation and active immunomodulation by specialized immune cells. Furthermore, wIRA can induce protective proteins, e.g. ferritin in the skin and potentially influences common cross-talks within cells and extracellular matrices. These effects display regulatory roles in wound repair processes that may also be responsible for positive cosmetic results. More important for the clinical assessment of wound healing in the early phase of hospitalization is the effect of wIRA to significantly reduce postoperative pain. Surgery and postoperative pain evoke stress related effects that are induced by profound neuroendocrine changes in cytokine activity and related processes. Increased blood flow, due to vasodilation, helps to strongly eliminate accumulated pain mediators, lactic acid and potential bacterial toxins. The metabolism is induced and mediates also non-thermal effects such as attraction of immune cells and potential effects on nociceptors. These direct effects of wIRA can be easily followed when postoperative irradiation is performed. The problem of developing wound infections may rely within the first hours after and already during the operation, when the wound gets ""preconditioned"" with potential mediators or bacteria that may lead to postoperative encountered wound infections. A recent study indicated that immediate postoperative warming for 2 hours after hernia surgery may provide comparable benefits to seven days of warming. According to the idea of preventing deleterious preconditions in the process of wound healing, we tested here, the one time preoperative application of wIRA and its impact on postoperative wound healing and related clinical questions. Comparable to preoperative antibiotic single shot treatment we relied on the expansive impact of preoperative wIRA application. The prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to study the effects of single time preoperative wIRA irradiation on the postoperative outcome of wound infections after visceral surgery.

One of the major complications of this device is the development of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) following implantation in 60% of patients. Glaucoma filtering is required in over 30% of patients at 2 years. Anecortave acetate (AA) has been shown to reduce steroid induced elevated IOP. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of prophylactic anterior juxtascleral depot administration of AA to prevent this Retisert induced elevated IOP. Test Article: Anecortave Acetate: 6% and 10% Sterile Suspension Drug Study Dosage: Patients will receive an injection (0.5 mL, 0.4 mL, or 0.2 mL of the 6% Anecortave Acetate suspension or 0.5 mL of the 10% suspension) of study medication every 4 months. Active Ingredients: Anecortave Acetate (AL-3789) Route of Administration: Sub-Tenon injection Objective(s): To evaluate the safety and efficacy of four dosages (50 mg, 30 mg, 24 mg, or 12 mg) of Anecortave Acetate (AA) for the prevention of steroid-induced intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations caused by Retisert. Study Population: Approximately 24 patients Structure: Parallel Group Duration of Treatment: 3 years Description: Observer-masked study of the safety and efficacy of Anecortave Acetate 6% or 10 % administered by a sub-Tenon injection.

National Cancer Institute (NCI),NIH,NCT03724084,Pinometostat With Standard Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia and MLL Gene Rearrangement,A Phase 1b/2 Study of Pinometostat in Combination With Standard Induction Chemotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia With MLL Rearrangement,"This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pinometostat and how well it works with standard chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia and a type of genetic mutation called MLL gene rearrangement. Pinometostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in standard chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pinometostat with standard chemotherapy may work better at treating acute myeloid leukemia.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine a safe and tolerable schedule of pinometostat continuous intravenous infusion in combination with daunorubicin hydrochloride (daunorubicin) and cytarabine in patients with untreated, newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia harboring MLL rearrangement.

II. Determine the rate of complete remission (complete remission \[CR\], CR with incomplete hematologic recovery \[CRi\]) in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia harboring MLL rearrangement after treatment with pinometostat in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Estimate biologic activity of 7 day window treatment of pinometostat monotherapy.

III. Estimate the toxicity profile of pinometostat alone (week 1) and in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine.

IV. Estimate event free and overall survival of patients with MLL rearranged acute myeloid leukemia after combination treatment with pinometostat, daunorubicin, and cytarabine.

V. Estimate the early death rate (death =\< 30 days) of pinometostat, daunorubicin, and cytarabine.

VI. Determine the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity by clinical flow cytometry on post-treatment recovery bone marrow.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pinometostat followed by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

COHORT I: Patients receive higher dose pinometostat intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-7 and lower dose pinometostrat IV continuously on days 8-35. Patients also receive daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 10-30 minutes on days 8-10 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 8-14. Cycles repeat every 35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not achieve CR/CRi after treatment receive pinometostat IV continuously on days 1-28, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1 and 2 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

COHORT II: Patients receive higher dose pinometostat IV continuously on days 1-35.

They are considered as an important risk factor for subsequent neuropsychological deficiency. Current pharmacological treatments are not very effective, and have side effects (agitation, irritability, sleep disorders, tachycardia). Some studies suggest that in NBs with apneas resisting to drugs, a permanent odorisation with a drop of vanillin on the incubator's pillow might reduce the frequency of apneas. This latin square design study will test a controlled olfactory stimulation method, i.e. an olfactometer which controls the odor duration, intensity, and sequence using three different odors, to reduce apneic episodes measured using 24-registration of heart and respiratory rates. Inclusion Criteria: * Newborns from a single or multiple pregnancy * Newborns hospitalized in the Lyon East or Saint-Etienne neonatology services, of both sexes, born before 33 weeks of amenorrhea and after at least 6 days of life, without respiratory disease beside premature birth. * Newborns must present at least 3 bradycardia during 3 days, or presenting apneas at observation. * Newborns will be randomized if they present at least 3 apnea episodes per 24 hour monitored by RECAN for 3 consecutive days prior to randomization. * Written informed consents obtained from the newborns parents or legal representatives Exclusion Criteria: * Severe congenital malformation * History of allergic reaction to smell stimulation (cough, sneeze, watery eyes, breathing pauses) * No social insurance"

University of Georgia,OTHER,NCT03522779,Antioxidant Responses to Exercise and Cherry Consumption,Antioxidant Responses to Exercise and Cherry Consumption,"To date, there are no published studies on the effects of tart cherry consumption on postprandial antioxidant and oxidative stress levels following a high-fat meal. Further, no one has looked at the effects of prior exercise on a high-fat meal that includes high phytonutrients like tart cherries. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of tart cherry consumption on antioxidant and oxidative stress levels in human plasma after consumption of a high-fat meal, as well as the postprandial impact of prior exercise in combination with tart cherry consumption on a high-fat meal.","Study Design: This will be a single blinded, randomized, cross-over design in healthy humans. There will be four study visits for the four different treatments: 1) a high-fat meal alone, 2) a high-fat meal with tart cherry consumption, 3) prior exercise to a high-fat meal alone, and 4) prior exercise to a high-fat meal with tart cherry consumption. All participants will complete all 4 treatments in a random order. There will be a 7-day washout period between each visit.

Subjects: We will recruit 25 apparently healthy, physically active (structured exercise \> 3h/week) adult men, ages 18-30 years. All subjects will be normal weight based on body mass index (BMI = 18-24.9kg/m2) or body composition (14-24% body fat). The IRB proposal has been submitted and will be reviewed this month. The entire study will take place at the CTRU and sample analysis will take place in the Dept. of Food Science and Technology.

Protocol: For 24h prior to testing, participants will be provided with all food and beverages. This will allow us to control their antioxidant intake prior to testing. The lead-in diet will be representative of a standard American diet and be low in total antioxidants. Estimated total daily energy needs will be based on each participants predicted resting metabolic rate and multiplied by a moderate physical activity value (1.65). Participants will consume all foods that are provided and no additional foods or beverages, may be consumed. Participants will arrive at the CTRU at 0700 hours in the fasted state (no food or drink for 8-12h) and will have abstained from exercise for 48h, unless participating in one of the 2 exercise treatment visits. Baseline measurements of height, weight, blood pressure, and body fat percentage will be taken. An intravenous catheter will be placed in the antecubital vein and a baseline sample will be taken.

Participants will then complete a high-fat meal challenge, either with or without tart cherries depending on their treatment visit. The meals will have tart cherry juice or a placebo consumed with a high-fat meal. The placebo will be designed to match the tart cherry juice for volume and macronutrient content, but without the phytonutrient content of the tart cherries. The high-fat breakfast meal will be a Sausage Biscuit and Hash Browns (McDonalds Corporation). Blood draws will then be obtained at 1, 2 and 3 hours postprandially for antioxidant and oxidative stress measurements.

Acute Exercise Protocol: Two of the four treatments will include an acute bout of submaximal aerobic exercise performed 15 hours (1600 hours; 4:00p.m.) prior to the high-fat meal test. The exercise will consist of 30 minutes of treadmill running at 70% of each participants' calculated heart rate reserve (HRR). This will be a supervised session where participants will wear a heart rate monitor. Participants will also be asked to give their ratings of perceived exertion every 10 minutes during the exercise bout. Participants will be instructed to consume the dinner meal provided to them after this exercise session is complete, which will also be 8-12h prior to the high-fat meal test.

Sample Analysis: Plasma will be tested for total anthocyanins content by HPLC-UV/VIS as well as HPLC-ESI-MS. Antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress measurements will be performed by H-ORACFL and FRAP assays.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Males, 18-30 years old, with normal body weight based on body mass index (BMI=18-24.9kg/m2) or are of normal weight based on body composition analysis using the DXA (14-24% body fat).

Despite this, the prolonged use of surgical and/or N-95 masks in the clinical setting and surgical masks in the non-clinical setting is the current standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The physiologic cost of wearing a respirator was demonstrated in healthy volunteers with mask use during heavy exertion associated with increased respiratory rate, blood pressure and heart rate. N95 use during light exercise increases CO2 intake reduces inspired oxygen and increases the work of breathing. The physiologic effects of N95 fit testing using a hood include higher CO2 levels and lower oxygen levels in the respirator. In patients with ESRD, N95 mask use was associated with reduced PaO2 and increased respiratory rate. The use of surgical masks for prolonged surgeries is associated with decreased SpO2 and increased heart rate, particularly in those over 35 years old. Many studies have suggested that there is a physiologic burden and risk of hypoxia associated with surgical and/or N95 mask use. This pilot study aims to compare baselines with each and both masks and with no mask versus short-duration exertion, which has not yet been done per review of the literature.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical evolution of individuals submitted to total hip arthroplasty in the ten year period. Method: Twenty individuals submitted to unilateral total hip arthroplasty will be evaluated by the medical group of hip surgeries of the Brotherhood of Santa Casa de Misericórdia of São Paulo, during a period of ten years. These individuals will undergo a primary clinical evaluation and after signing the consent form, will be evaluated functionally with the HARRIS HIP SCORE and WHOQOL-bref questionnaires and physically with the analysis of muscular strength through manual dynamometry to measure the strength level of the Muscles involved in the bilateral coxo-femoral joint, such as abductors, adductors, flexors, extensors, internal rotators, external rotators, knee joint, such as extensors and flexors, and ankle, plantar flexors. Finally, they will be referred to the kinematic gait analysis, to identify the functional characteristics of these individuals, through reflexive markers at specific anatomical points, where they will walk for 5 minutes on a treadmill at a speed of 1.5km per hour. Inclusion Criteria: * The inclusion criteria in the study will be: patients submitted to total hip arthroplasty between 2 years (24 months - 35 months), 5 years (60 months - 71 months) and 10 years (120 months - 131 months), age between 50 and 80 years and sign the terms of free and informed consent Exclusion Criteria: * The exclusion criteria will be: patients with a history of prosthesis dislocations or revision of the arthroplasty, pain in the hip or lower limb region, asymmetry of the lower limbs greater than 2 centimeters, previous surgeries in the lower limbs, limitation of range of motion in the joint (Impossible to perform muscle strength tests), use of antidepressive drugs or analgesics of continuous use, chronic diseases not controlled (Hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes) and the presence of neuromuscular pathologies"
The University of Hong Kong,OTHER,NCT01887184,Sedation Using Intranasal Dexmedetomidine in Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,A Study to Assess Sedation Using Intranasal Dexmedetomidine in Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,"Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, like many other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, may be associated with discomfort. Although upper endoscopy is usually of shorter duration and better tolerated by patients, most trials investigating the influence of analgesia and sedation have been performed on patients undergoing this procedure. Some patients may tolerate colonoscopy without sedation, but various techniques are used to limit discomfort and pain. Selection and dosing of sedatives depends on the patient's emotional state, the intensity of pain during examination, foreseeable technical difficulties, the endoscopist's experience, the presence or absence of anesthesia personnel, and hospital-specific procedures.

Conscious sedation is a popular technique for colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The combination of an opioid and a benzodiazepine is known to provide good analgesic and sedative conditions during endoscopy. This combination of opioid and benzodiazepine, however, also increases the risk of respiratory depression. Therefore, pharmacologic agents which may provide adequate sedation without respiratory depression are of great interest to clinicians.

Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative and analgesic effects. Compared with clonidine, it is more selective for the α 2 adrenoceptor and acts as a full agonist in most pharmacologic test models. Potentially desirable properties include decreased requirements for other anesthetics and analgesics, a diminished sympathetic response to stress and the potential for cardioprotective effects against myocardial ischemia. When compared with conventional sedatives such as opioids or benzodiazepines, its lack of respiration depression is a distinct advantage. Previous studies using dexmedetomidine for sedation has been promising with maintenance of respiratory function. Patients are readily arousable. With intravenous slow bolus administration, there is a minimal increase in blood pressure initially, followed by a slight decrease in blood pressure. Lower dose ranges, avoidance of rapid bolus injection, and a slow rate of administration tend to decrease these circulatory side effects. Many clinical studies have shown that it can be well and safely used intravenously, intramuscularly and transdermally. Although not an officially technique, there are also reports of intranasal administration resulting in fairly predictable onset in both adults and children.","Aims:

This study aims to evaluate sedative effects using intranasal dexmedetomidine in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy, side effects and acceptability of sedation using intranasal dexmedetomidine by patients and endoscopist for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Methods:

Double blind randomized prospective study.

Sample size:

We are planning to detect not less than 30% decrease of rescue propofol consumption when using intranasal dexmedetomidine. Assuming the average propofol consumption for the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to be 40mg with SD=15mg, the required sample size with 80% power of test is 25 per group at the 0.05 level of significance.

They will be randomly allocated to one of the following study groups:

Group D: Intranasal dexmedetomidine 1.5mcg/kg; Group P: Intranasal saline (placebo)

In addition, rescue sedation will be provided by a patient-controlled sedation using propofol/ alfentanil in both groups. Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) has been shown to provide safe and effective sedation for the individual patient by allowing the patient to decide whether he or she requires sedation and to determine the amount required. PCS has been used for various procedures performed under local and regional anesthesia. PCS with propofol and alfentanil has been used for sedation of patients during endoscopy.

Process Written consent will be signed. No sedative premedication will be prescribed. The patients will be fasted for 6 hours before the procedure. Then patients will be sent to the endoscopy room about 1 hour before the procedure. A nasal catheter is positioned to deliver oxygen if oxygen is needed. Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2 and respiratory rate will be recorded. After obtaining baseline hemodynamic data (NIBP, HR) and respiratory data (SpO2, RR), the patients will be asked to evaluate their baseline levels of anxiety using a numerical rating scale.

The intranasal study drugs will be administrated according to a code on a piece of folded paper drawn randomly from a box. The patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups and sedation will be performed 1 hour before the procedure as follows:

P) Placebo (0.015ml/kg); D) Intranasal dexmedetomidine 0.015ml/kg

Before study drug administration, patients gently blow their noses. After baseline testing, an investigator who is blind to the study medication will administers the study drug to each naris and the patient remains in a semi-recumbent position with the head of the bed elevated at a 20-40 angle.

After which, measurements including HR, NiBP, SpO2, RR will be recorded every 5 minutes while Numerical Rating Scale of anxiety every 15 minutes. Sedation is evaluated by investigator using Observer Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation (OAA/S\]) scale every 15 minutes. Both the investigators and the subjects are blinded to the study medications. The patient will be shown 2 cards of picture about 1 hour after the study drug administration.

An intravenous cannula will be inserted then. The degree of the cannulation pain will be assessed as using NRSpaincannulation. The intravenous cannula is connected to a 50 mL syringe patient-controlled analgesia pump containing 200 mg (20 mL) propofol and 0.5 mg (1 mL) alfentanil, which will be provided as the rescue sedative medications. The drugs are delivered in response to pressure on a hand-held button. Each bolus dose of 0.5 mL delivered contained 4.8 mg propofol and 12 μg alfentanil. No loading dose was used and the lock out time was set at zero. Despite the zero lock out time, a few seconds were required for the pump to deliver the preset bolus. The PCA pump was programmed to deliver a bolus dose of 0.5 ml at 200 ml/h on patient's demand and the pump took 9 s to deliver the bolus, during which time it would not respond to a further demand. Thus, the effective lockout time was 9s. Patients are instructed in the use of the hand-held button before upper endoscopy.

After the cannulation, local anesthetic spray will be administered to the oropharynx or rectum. 10 minutes after the local anesthesia, patient may start to push the button. When the first dose of propofol and alfentanil is infused, patient will be asked whether there is any pain of infusion, and the degree of the pain will be assessed as Numerical Rating Scale of pain due to infusion.

The procedure will be started once the patients feel that they are relaxed. Vital signs including NIBP, SpO2, HR, RR, and OAA/S will be monitored throughout the sedation and procedure process every 5 minutes. If the patient becomes totally unresponsive or any adverse event occurs, the procedure will be stopped. If the SpO2 falls to below 90% for more than 10 seconds, the endoscope will be removed and the patient's vital signs observed, and O2 administered as required by the attending anesthesiologist until the patient becomes responsive again. Once the patient starts responding to command, the procedure will continue. Duration of unresponsiveness would be recorded. The time of start of procedure and duration of procedure and the frequencies of interruption due to patient events will be noted. The PCS propofol and alfentanil will be terminated and disconnected from the patient when the endoscopist indicates that the operative procedure is completed, and the dose consumption recorded. The endoscopist will determine the operating conditions by evaluating the ease of insertion and the patient's lack of motion and ability to obey commands, using NRSsatisfactionendoscopist.

The patients will be transferred to the recovery room for monitoring for 30 minutes. The vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, RR and SpO2, and OAA/S) will be continued every 5 min. When the patients are fully recovered, they will be asked if there is any pain and discomfort and their severity will be assessed as NRSpain and NRSdiscomfort during the procedure. Discomfort is defined as 'a feeling of uneasiness that interfered with the patient's ability to relax'. They will also be asked if they remember any of the following events: the pictures shown to them, the insertion of the endoscope, the discomfort and pain during the examination.

Discharge criteria will be assessed as postanaesthesia discharge score hourly. When the patients are fully recovered, defined as an OAA/S score of 5 and the postanaesthesia score is more than 9, they are fit for discharge. Satisfaction evaluation of sedation will be graded by the patients on NRS in satisfaction patient. They will be questioned on whether they think that they have received an adequate amount of sedation, too little or too much, whether they are relaxed and whether they will undergo the same procedure again.

"Siesta Medical, Inc.",INDUSTRY,NCT01611779,FAST as a Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea,Functional Advancement and Suspension of the Tongue (FAST) as a Treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea,The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of tongue suspension using the Siesta Medical Encore Tongue Suspension System for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has become a major health problem in the United States. With prevalence in middle-aged adults of 2-4% of the population, untreated OSA has been implicated in increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and heart failure.

The first and most common treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, utilized by an estimated 3 million Americans. CPAP is effective in reducing apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is used properly. However, the nasal mask required for CPAP during sleep leads to poor acceptance and compliance rates. Published studies on CPAP have shown that only 58-8-% of patient accept CPAP therapy and further 65-90% of these patients exhibit long-term compliance with CPAP.

It is widely accepted that the region behind the tongue is a major site of collapse during obstructive sleep apnea.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has become a major health problem in the United States. With prevalence in middle-aged adults of 2-4% of the population, untreated OSA has been implicated in increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and heart failure. The first and most common treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, utilized by an estimated 3 million Americans. CPAP is effective in reducing apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is used properly. However, the nasal mask required for CPAP during sleep leads to poor acceptance and compliance rates. Published studies on CPAP have shown that only 58-8-% of patient accept CPAP therapy and further 65-90% of these patients exhibit long-term compliance with CPAP. It is widely accepted that the region behind the tongue is a major site of collapse during obstructive sleep apnea.

These improvements are unfortunately countered by the emergence of side effects of critical illness, known as PICU-acquired complications (PACs). Delirium, muscle weakness, drug dependency and withdrawal are increasingly common. PACs occur because children are often over-sedated and experience long periods of immobilization. PACs delay recovery, increase disability and worsen long-term function and quality-of-life. Although they are preventable, PACs are very common and frequently overlooked by clinicians. This study aims to ""liberate""children from critical illness and improve their recovery and functioning after discharge, through an innovative rehabilitation bundle of 8 complementary steps (PICU Liber8) to reduce sedation, allow children to awaken and breathe comfortably, encourage early mobilization, and engage families in their child's care.","This is a pilot quality improvement implementation study that will measure the impact of a rehabilitation bundle.

The objectives are:

1. Primary - Implementation Objectives: to determine the feasibility and resources required to implement PICU Liber8 in 2 PICUs, evaluate strategies for successful bundle adoption. Co-Primary - Process Objectives: to determine the impact of PICU Liber8 on the process of care.
2. Secondary Efficacy: impact on PACs and patient reported outcomes The methods consist of a PICU Liber8 Bundle Implementation Plan (Pronovost's 4 E's Framework), and measurement of the impact of Implementation through Orchestrated Testing (OT).

For successful adoption of the PICU Liber8 bundle, the following are necessary:

1. A context appropriate implementation framework.
2. An implementation team leader.
3. Inter-professional team engagement (i.e. RN, RT, MD, pharmacy, allied health and family).

Almost one million children die each year due to complications of preterm birth and in almost all countries with reliable data, preterm birth rates are increasing. Of the 14 million survivors per year, many face a lifetime of disability, including learning disabilities, visual and hearing impairments. Spontaneous preterm delivery (SPTD) is often multi factorial event, precocious cervical softening, shortening and dilatation are a common denominator.

Preterm delivery is closely related to a premature cervical ripening. The scientific bases for the proposed project is the elasticity modulus of a cervix is a more sensitive parameter characterizing the stage of cervical ripening. The main component of the cervix tissue is a collagen. Cervical ripening is the result of realignment of collagen, degradation of collagen cross-linking due to proteolytic enzymes. These processes affect the elasticity modulus of the cervical tissue. Therefore, assessment of cervix by a device measuring cervical elasticity and cervical length appears to be and adequate approach for identifying pregnant women at high risk of spontaneous preterm delivery.
