Colorado State University,OTHER,NCT05895084,Neural Markers of Balance in Adults With Brain Injury,Neural Markers of Static & Dynamic Balance Before & After Yoga in Adults With Brain Injury,The feasibility study is designed to assess the feasibility of conducting a group yoga intervention and acquiring neuroimaging data in adults with chronic brain injury.,"In the United States in 2014, nearly 2.9 million individuals sustained traumatic brain injuries that resulted in emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and death. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by trauma, or an external force that creates rapid acceleration and deceleration of the brain within the skull creating lasting neurophysiological dysfunction. Although there are many effective treatment strategies for the weeks and months post-injury (e.g. intensive, multi-disciplinary in-patient rehabilitation), millions of individuals are living with residual disability from brain injury following discharge to home. This residual disability can include significant social, cognitive, emotional, and physical impairment. To date, there are limited strategies for treating the residual deficits of chronic brain injury. One such physical deficit is balance impairment, which is associated with increased fall risk, reduced community integration, and decreased quality of life. The use of intensive, holistic rehabilitation may be effective for improving balance and other impairments in individuals with chronic brain injury. Yoga, a holistic treatment option, is thought to be more therapeutic than traditional exercise because of the integration of the mind, body, and spirit. Further, yoga can be modified to accommodate individual abilities and needs. And, unlike formal rehabilitation, yoga does not need to be approved by insurance or prescribed by a physician and adapted yoga is available in the community. Thus, yoga is readily available, so long as yoga instructors are trained to appropriately modify activities.

The goal is to determine if this technique is suitable and equal to a standard venous blood collection for the analysis of blood sodium levels.The purpose is to compare both sodium levels to determine if they are equal so the technique can be used in a clinical setting for people who need regular blood collections for the determination of sodium, for example after the start of desmopressin use.","Currently, serum sodium levels are determined by standard venous blood sampling. This method is invasive, painful and a relatively large amount of blood is drawn (5ml). Repeated blood draws are necessary in certain patient groups. If sodium values can be determined on a capillary blood sample instead of a classic venous blood sample, the total blood volume will be smaller. In addition, in the future, the aim is to perform capillary blood sampling at home and to send the sample by courier, thus saving the patient a trip to the doctor's office or a nurse at home.

The aim of this prospective interventional study is to validate the sodium values on a capillary blood sample obtained via fingerstick (250µL). To demonstrate that the obtained values are reliable and clinically useful they will be compared one-on-one with the sodium values determined on a standard venous blood sample. Since it is important to validate a broad range of sodium values, a heterogeneous study population is chosen to obtain sufficient variation.

The sodium values from the capillary blood draw will be compared with the values from the venous blood draw, with each patient acting as their own control. There is no need to have the venous blood samples analyzed by Labo Maenhout, as the clinical lab of UZ Gent uses the same technique for sodium determination (indirect determination) as Labo Maenhout.

Universidade da Coruña,OTHER,NCT04949984,Bright Light Therapy in Older Adults With Moderate to Very Severe Dementia,"Bright Light Therapy in Older Adults With Moderate to Very Severe Dementia: Effects on Cognition, Mood, Behavior, and Physiological Parameters","INTRODUCTION: Bright light therapy (BLT) has demonstrated positive effects on sleep, mood, and behavioral problems in older adults with dementia. However, there is little research in people with advanced stages of dementia.

OBJECTIVES: Main objectives are to study the immediate effects, short and long-term effects of BLT in a sample of institutionalized older adults with moderate to very severe dementia. Later, to compare the potential effectiveness of bright light therapy sessions with other non-pharmacological interventions in people with dementia.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study was a 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial using a two-group design (BLT vs. control) and two repeated measures (pre- vs. postintervention). In addition, the BLT group participants were assessed immediately before, after, and during each session. The BLT protocol consisted of 30-minute morning sessions of 10,000 lux, Monday through Friday, for 4 weeks.

For the statistical analysis, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to determine the existence of differences at two points in time (pre- vs. post-). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test or the Paired t test are used to measure changes from before to after the intervention sessions.","INTRODUCTION: Dementia is one of the main causes of disability and dependence among older adults worldwide, constituting a public health priority due to its significant human and financial costs to society. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been proposed for the management of its clinical manifestations. The nonpharmacological interventions, which include bright light therapy (BLT), are recommended by numerous guidelines as initial treatment strategies due to the absence of adverse events. BLT consists of the controlled application of certain levels of light that can be administered in several ways. There is some evidence that effective doses of light would stimulate circadian cycles, thus affecting sleep efficiency, depression, or behavioral problems in older adults with dementia, but there is little research on persons in advanced stages of dementia.

The lack of consensus on the protocol for BLT application, as well as the existence of little research on individuals in advanced stages of dementia, calls for further research to explore in-depth the immediate, short- and long-term effects of BLT in this population.

Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli,OTHER,NCT02427984,Pending Failure in Hard-hard Total Hip Arthroplasty,Early Diagnosis of Pending Failures of Total Hip Arthroplasty With Hard to Hard Bearings,"During last 6 years approximately 10.000 ceramic balls and 5.000 ceramic liners have been implanted in the region Emilia-Romagna in Italy (4 million Every single year approximately 60.000 hip prostheses are implanted in Italy. Quality of life of patients after surgery is very good, as widely demonstrated in the literature. On the basis of data produced by the only complete hip register in Italy that is run in our Lab (RIPO, Register of Orthopedic Implants in the Region Emilia-Romagna) survival rate of primary total hip prosthesis is 95.6% at 9 years. Reasons for revision are mainly aseptic loosening of one or both components (40% of the total) and dislocation (26%), being the latter much more frequent in the first two years. Less frequently revision is due to sepsis (7% of the total),bone fracture (11%), prosthesis fracture (3%) or pain (3%). Revision is relates, among the others, to prosthesis-related factors, such as fixation to bone and articular coupling. In our experience, during the last ten years 32% of implants had both articular component in ceramic , 34% had metal head and plastic liner, 24% ceramic head and plastic liner, 10% both components in metal.

Each solution has strengths and weakness and they have been identified and clinically applied in order to overcome step by step limitations observed in the previous one. The most recent are the hard-on-hard bearings, that is ceramic on ceramic and metal on metal. These two solutions, beside very promising results on wear resistance, show some peculiar failures: respectively fracture of the ceramic component and hypersensitivity induced by metal ions.

Aim of research proposal is to investigate two uncommon and less investigated early symptoms of failure:

* 'noising hip' in ceramic on ceramic total hip arthroplasty
* pain without radiographic signs of loosening in metal on metal total hip arthroplasty These two situations are extremely relevant, as they prelude to a failure of the prosthesis. If clearly identified they could represent a powerful tool in early diagnosis of pending failure To reach this goal our patients wearing hard-on-hard total hip arthroplasty, suffering for described symptoms will undergone a specific diagnostic procedure.

The first group will be studied through CT scan of the patients to evaluate impingement or instability of the prosthesis, and a needle aspiration for synovial fluid. The fluid will be examined to identify ceramic wear debris, according to a method of separation and analysis in scanning electron microscopy that was set in our Lab.

Sound will be recorded by means of a wearable sensor set capable of recording the articular noise produced during level walking. This instrumentation will be coupled to motion analysis technology.

This would make possible a diagnostic approach able to correlate the involved factors to clinical occurrences, on the basis of the recorded frequencies.

-Second group will be studied through the dosage of circulating ions, deriving from the articular surfaces and through the histological classification of vasculitis in periimplant tissues. There is increasing evidence, indeed that locale release of submicron particles worn out from articular surfaces can release metal ions (mainly Chromium and Cobalt) responsible for lymphocyte local infiltration. In particular CD20 positive B lymphocyte and CD3 positive T lymphocyte and sometimes CD68 positive plasma cells are present. The cells could justify the development of pseudotumors in metal-on metal hip prosthesis.

Data collected from patients matched to in vitro results will allow us to to avoid or at least propose a more appropriate timing for revision surgery.","Every single year approximately 60.000 hip prostheses are implanted in Italy. Quality of life of patients after surgery is very good, as widely demonstrated in clinical experience and in the literature. On the basis of data produced by the only complete hip register in Italy, that is run in our Lab (RIPO, Register of Orthopedic Implants in the Region Emilia-Romagna http://ripo.cineca.it) survival rate of primary total hip prosthesis is 95.6% at 9 years. Reasons for revision are mainly aseptic loosening of one or both components (40% of the total) and dislocation (26%), being the latter much more frequent in the first two years. Less frequently revision is due to sepsis (7% of the total),bone fracture (11%), prosthesis fracture (3%) or pain (3%).

Revision can be related, among the others, to prosthesis-linked factors, such as fixation to bone and articular coupling.

In the experience of RIPO, during the last ten years 32% of implants had both articular component in ceramic, 34% had metal head and plastic liner, 24% ceramic head and plastic liner, 10% both components in metal.

Each solution has strengths and weakness and they have been identified and clinically applied in order to overcome step by step limitations observed in the previous one.

Alumina ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) bearings have been shown to produce substantially less wear debris than traditional metal/ceramic on polyethylene bearings. In addition, the alumina ceramic material itself is essentially bioinert in both bulk and particulate form . Unlike metal-on-metal bearings (MOM), this bearing couple does not release metal ions into the body either from the articulation or from breakdown of wear debris. Weakness of ceramic-on-ceramic bearings are represented by brittleness of the material. Ceramic can fracture, even in very few cases, due to trauma or to malpositioning. Beside this occurrence of noise during gait of patients can be extremely disturbing for patient itself, leading to request of revision. These two solutions represent more recent proposal that technology suggested to overcome problem of wear.

Hard components on plastic has the unsolved problem of wear debris, leading to osteolysis and consequent failure of he im plant. The problem has only partially solved by the introduction of cross linked polyethylene, aimed to improve tribological behaviour of the plastic.

Rizzoli Institute is the only public mono-specialistic research hospital in Italy. Nearly 500 hip prosthesis revisions are performed here every year in the structure. Due to its high specialization difficult cases from all the country are treated here, not on ly when anatomy of the patient is damaged (dislocation of the hip, post traumatic arthritis) but .even more frequently when failure of the implant occurred.

Aim of research proposal is to investigate two uncommon and less investigated early symptoms of failure:

* 'noising hip' in ceramic on ceramic total hip arthroplasty
* pain in metal on metal total hip arthroplasty Even if not numerically so important, these two situations are extremely relevant, as they prelude to a failure of the prosthesis. If clearly identified they could represent a powerful tool in early diagnosis of pending failure.

The first point will be studied through CT scan of the patients to evaluate impingement or instability of the prosthesis, and a needle aspiration for synovial fluid. The fluid will be examined to identify ceramic wear debris, according to a method of separation and analysis in scanning electron microscopy that was set in our Lab.

Sound will be recorded by means of a wearable sensor set capable of recording the articular noise produced during level walking. This instrumentation will be coupled to motion analysis technology, so as to provide a temporal correlation between the recorded noise and the gait cycle. It will be developed in the first phase of the project. In parallel surface analyses will be conducted on retrievals that are stored in the Lab since 2000, in one of the biggest retrieval study ever conducted in our country. Type of damage, surface roughness of both ceramic components will be analysed and compared to clinical data.

Finally the study will be completed in vitro, using an hip simulator, to reproduce the possible clinical scenarios leading to hip noise, record, and analyse it in a reproducible and robust manner. This would make possible a diagnostic approach able to correlate the involved factors to clinical occurrences, on the basis of the recorded frequencies. Second point will be studied through the dosage of circulating ions, deriving from the articular surfaces and through the histological classification of vasculitis in periimplant tissues. There is increasing evidence, indeed that locale release of submicron particles worn out from articular surfaces can release metal ions (mainly Chromium and Cobalt) responsible for lymphocyte local infiltration. In particular cluster of differentiation antigen 20 (CD20) positive B lymphocyte and cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) positive T lymphocyte and sometimes cluster of differentiation antigen 68 (CD68) positive plasma cells are present. The cells could indicate a specific phlogistic condition responsible for pain and eventually subsequent revision.

Data collected on studied population will allow a better understanding of the two phenomena and possibly will suggest new therapeutic approaches to the problems.","Inclusion Criteria:

Revision is relates, among the others, to prosthesis-related factors, such as fixation to bone and articular coupling. In our experience, during the last ten years 32% of implants had both articular component in ceramic , 34% had metal head and plastic liner, 24% ceramic head and plastic liner, 10% both components in metal. Each solution has strengths and weakness and they have been identified and clinically applied in order to overcome step by step limitations observed in the previous one. The most recent are the hard-on-hard bearings, that is ceramic on ceramic and metal on metal. These two solutions, beside very promising results on wear resistance, show some peculiar failures: respectively fracture of the ceramic component and hypersensitivity induced by metal ions. Aim of research proposal is to investigate two uncommon and less investigated early symptoms of failure: * 'noising hip' in ceramic on ceramic total hip arthroplasty * pain without radiographic signs of loosening in metal on metal total hip arthroplasty These two situations are extremely relevant, as they prelude to a failure of the prosthesis. If clearly identified they could represent a powerful tool in early diagnosis of pending failure To reach this goal our patients wearing hard-on-hard total hip arthroplasty, suffering for described symptoms will undergone a specific diagnostic procedure. The first group will be studied through CT scan of the patients to evaluate impingement or instability of the prosthesis, and a needle aspiration for synovial fluid. The fluid will be examined to identify ceramic wear debris, according to a method of separation and analysis in scanning electron microscopy that was set in our Lab. Sound will be recorded by means of a wearable sensor set capable of recording the articular noise produced during level walking. This instrumentation will be coupled to motion analysis technology. This would make possible a diagnostic approach able to correlate the involved factors to clinical occurrences, on the basis of the recorded frequencies. -Second group will be studied through the dosage of circulating ions, deriving from the articular surfaces and through the histological classification of vasculitis in periimplant tissues. There is increasing evidence, indeed that locale release of submicron particles worn out from articular surfaces can release metal ions (mainly Chromium and Cobalt) responsible for lymphocyte local infiltration. In particular CD20 positive B lymphocyte and CD3 positive T lymphocyte and sometimes CD68 positive plasma cells are present. The cells could justify the development of pseudotumors in metal-on metal hip prosthesis. Data collected from patients matched to in vitro results will allow us to to avoid or at least propose a more appropriate timing for revision surgery. Every single year approximately 60.000 hip prostheses are implanted in Italy. Quality of life of patients after surgery is very good, as widely demonstrated in clinical experience and in the literature. On the basis of data produced by the only complete hip register in Italy, that is run in our Lab (RIPO, Register of Orthopedic Implants in the Region Emilia-Romagna http://ripo.cineca.it) survival rate of primary total hip prosthesis is 95.6% at 9 years. Reasons for revision are mainly aseptic loosening of one or both components (40% of the total) and dislocation (26%), being the latter much more frequent in the first two years. Less frequently revision is due to sepsis (7% of the total),bone fracture (11%), prosthesis fracture (3%) or pain (3%). Revision can be related, among the others, to prosthesis-linked factors, such as fixation to bone and articular coupling. In the experience of RIPO, during the last ten years 32% of implants had both articular component in ceramic, 34% had metal head and plastic liner, 24% ceramic head and plastic liner, 10% both components in metal. Each solution has strengths and weakness and they have been identified and clinically applied in order to overcome step by step limitations observed in the previous one. Alumina ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) bearings have been shown to produce substantially less wear debris than traditional metal/ceramic on polyethylene bearings. In addition, the alumina ceramic material itself is essentially bioinert in both bulk and particulate form . Unlike metal-on-metal bearings (MOM), this bearing couple does not release metal ions into the body either from the articulation or from breakdown of wear debris. Weakness of ceramic-on-ceramic bearings are represented by brittleness of the material. Ceramic can fracture, even in very few cases, due to trauma or to malpositioning. Beside this occurrence of noise during gait of patients can be extremely disturbing for patient itself, leading to request of revision. These two solutions represent more recent proposal that technology suggested to overcome problem of wear. Hard components on plastic has the unsolved problem of wear debris, leading to osteolysis and consequent failure of he im plant. The problem has only partially solved by the introduction of cross linked polyethylene, aimed to improve tribological behaviour of the plastic. Rizzoli Institute is the only public mono-specialistic research hospital in Italy. Nearly 500 hip prosthesis revisions are performed here every year in the structure. Due to its high specialization difficult cases from all the country are treated here, not on ly when anatomy of the patient is damaged (dislocation of the hip, post traumatic arthritis) but .even more frequently when failure of the implant occurred. Aim of research proposal is to investigate two uncommon and less investigated early symptoms of failure: * 'noising hip' in ceramic on ceramic total hip arthroplasty * pain in metal on metal total hip arthroplasty Even if not numerically so important, these two situations are extremely relevant, as they prelude to a failure of the prosthesis. If clearly identified they could represent a powerful tool in early diagnosis of pending failure. The first point will be studied through CT scan of the patients to evaluate impingement or instability of the prosthesis, and a needle aspiration for synovial fluid. The fluid will be examined to identify ceramic wear debris, according to a method of separation and analysis in scanning electron microscopy that was set in our Lab. Sound will be recorded by means of a wearable sensor set capable of recording the articular noise produced during level walking. This instrumentation will be coupled to motion analysis technology, so as to provide a temporal correlation between the recorded noise and the gait cycle. It will be developed in the first phase of the project. In parallel surface analyses will be conducted on retrievals that are stored in the Lab since 2000, in one of the biggest retrieval study ever conducted in our country. Type of damage, surface roughness of both ceramic components will be analysed and compared to clinical data. Finally the study will be completed in vitro, using an hip simulator, to reproduce the possible clinical scenarios leading to hip noise, record, and analyse it in a reproducible and robust manner. This would make possible a diagnostic approach able to correlate the involved factors to clinical occurrences, on the basis of the recorded frequencies. Second point will be studied through the dosage of circulating ions, deriving from the articular surfaces and through the histological classification of vasculitis in periimplant tissues. There is increasing evidence, indeed that locale release of submicron particles worn out from articular surfaces can release metal ions (mainly Chromium and Cobalt) responsible for lymphocyte local infiltration. In particular cluster of differentiation antigen 20 (CD20) positive B lymphocyte and cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) positive T lymphocyte and sometimes cluster of differentiation antigen 68 (CD68) positive plasma cells are present. The cells could indicate a specific phlogistic condition responsible for pain and eventually subsequent revision. Data collected on studied population will allow a better understanding of the two phenomena and possibly will suggest new therapeutic approaches to the problems.

This includes an estimate of the absolute risk of rare serious adverse outcomes.,"During the development of oral contraceptives (OCs) over the last decades, ethinyl-estradiol (EE) has been reduced under the hypothesis that lower EE doses lead to a better safety profile and specifically to a lower venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence. However, the reduction of the EE dose led to a less favorable bleeding control.

Though EE has been utilized within numerous OCs, efforts have been made to utilize estradiol (E2) and estradiol valerate (EV) which have lower impact on the hepatic system and subsequently on hemostatic parameters. Bayer Schering Pharma has developed a new EV based OC in a dosing regimen that combines both reliable contraception and acceptable bleeding profile.

The INAS-SCORE study was designed as an international, prospective, controlled, non-interventional cohort study. The study was started in Europe and was extended to the US after the launch of the new regimen. New users of an OC (starters or switchers) are accrued by a network of prescribing physicians. Even in the event of high drop-out rates, a 3 to 5-year follow-up of 50,000 women should be sufficient to document about 150,000 women-years. Baseline and follow-up information are collected via a self-administered questionnaire. All self-reported clinical outcomes of interest will be validated via health care professionals. Classification of reported outcomes as ""confirmed"" or ""unconfirmed"" will be checked via blinded, independent adjudication. A multifaceted 4-level follow-up procedure proved to ensure low loss to follow-up rates.

The main clinical outcomes of interest for the short and long-term follow-up are cardiovascular events, primarily deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accidents.

Data analysis will be based on life-table methods. All analyses will make allowance for confounding, using multivariate techniques such as Cox regression.

Study amendment:

Follow-up was initially expected to last until 2014 for the United States and Europe. However, the European regulatory authorities were concerned about the low proportion of Qlaira users in the United States and requested that the primary analysis should be based on the European study arm only. However, this reduction in sample size results in a reduction of the statistical power.

Therefore it was agreed upon with the European regulatory authorities to extend the follow-up period in Europe till 2016. This will ensure that the statistical power in the European study arm will be as high as the originally planned power for the complete study population (European and US study population combined).

University of Pittsburgh,OTHER,NCT04879979,GIST and Memory and Attention Adaptation Training,Cognitive Impairment in GIST Patients on Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Improve Cognitive Symptoms,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be efficacious in the treatment of cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT) has been evaluated in previous clinical trials with samples of breast cancer survivors and found effective at reducing cancer-related cognitive impairment. MAAT has been demonstrated to be efficacious when it is delivered via videoconference.The use of telehealth delivery enhances access to cancer survivorship care and reduces time and travel burden among cancer survivors, especially those who live in rural and/or underserved areas where cancer survivor services are less available.

People with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors also experience self-reported cancer-related cognitive impairment. In order to determine if MAAT can sufficiently treat CRCI among people with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), we propose a trial of MAAT to determine its initial level of effectiveness in improving both self-reported cognitive impairments and objective neuropsychological test performance in GIST patients.","This study is a single-group, repeated measures (pre-post-intervention) design. This low-cost, simple design is intended to gather pilot data to gain an understanding of preliminary MAAT efficacy in the population of people with GIST who have cognitive complaints. The objective of the study is to estimate the magnitude of clinical effect of MAAT (delivered via videoconference, telehealth technology) on perceived cognitive impairment and neuropsychological test performance among GIST patients with cognitive complaints. The primary objectives consist of the telephone-based assessment of neuropsychological status (TBANS) and self-reported cognitive symptoms as assessed by the FACT-Cog perceived cognitive impairments (PCI) scale and impact on quality of life scale (IQOL). Within-group effect size will be calculated to determine clinical effect of MAAT on group outcomes on neuropsychological and self-reported outcome measures (PCI, IQOL). The reliable change index (RCI) will be calculated to determine minimal clinically important differences in pre-to-post change in individual cases on FACT-Cog (PCI; IQOL) outcomes. The proportion of cases who exceed reliable change (""reliable"" difference in pre-to-post-intervention FACT-Cog scores) will be quantified. The secondary objective is to estimate the magnitude of effect of MAAT on depressive symptoms, anxiety and fatigue among GIST patients with cognitive complaints. This will be done using a self-reported questionnaire (total scores/T-scores); a within-group effect size calculated to determine clinical effect of MAAT on group outcomes on self-reported outcome measures (PROMIS Depression 8a; PROMIS Anxiety 8a, PROMIS® Pain 3a, PROMIS® Fatigue 8a) and a within group effect size to determine clinical effect on group outcomes and published minimal clinically important differences in pre-to-post change individual cases.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving interleukin-2 together with sargramostim works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that was previously treated with chemotherapy.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the frequency of complete response in patients with stage III or IV melanoma who have achieved either a partial response or stable disease after prior systemic chemotherapy and are treated with maintenance biotherapy comprising interleukin-2 and sargramostim (GM-CSF).

Secondary

* Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the effects of this regimen on lymphocyte subsets in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to response to prior systemic chemotherapy (stable disease \[SD\] vs partial response \[PR\]).

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving interleukin-2 together with sargramostim works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that was previously treated with chemotherapy. OBJECTIVES: Primary * Determine the frequency of complete response in patients with stage III or IV melanoma who have achieved either a partial response or stable disease after prior systemic chemotherapy and are treated with maintenance biotherapy comprising interleukin-2 and sargramostim (GM-CSF). Secondary * Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. * Determine the effects of this regimen on lymphocyte subsets in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to response to prior systemic chemotherapy (stable disease \[SD\] vs partial response \[PR\]). Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-14 and low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive pulses of high-dose IL-2\* IV continuously over 42 hours on days 1 and 2 of courses 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12. NOTE: \*Low-dose IL-2 and GM-CSF are not administered on days 1 and 2 of high-dose IL-2 administration Patients who continue to have SD or a PR after 12 courses of therapy may continue to receive treatment with GM-CSF and low-dose IL-2 as described above and high-dose IL-2 on days 1 and 2 of every third course.

Ezetimibe is a lipid-controlling drug; statins are part of another class of lipid-lowering drugs popularly prescribed to people with high cholesterol. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of ezetimibe in combination with statin therapy in adults who are taking anti-HIV drugs and have high cholesterol.

Study hypothesis: In HIV infected adults, ezetimibe in combination with statin therapy will result in significantly lower LDL-c compared to statin therapy alone.","Lipid metabolism abnormalities are common complications of HIV therapy, particularly with PIs. Statins and other lipid-lowering agents are often prescribed to control elevated cholesterol levels in both HIV infected and uninfected people. However, both antiretroviral therapy (ART) and lipid-lowering drugs may be associated with cardiovascular disease, so there is a clear need to find a lipid-lowering drug with low toxicity. This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of ezetimibe, a lipid-controlling agent, in combination with ongoing statin therapy in HIV infected people currently on ART.

It is hoped that a medicine called TAK-951 may help people to not feel sick in the stomach or throw up. The main aim of this study is to learn about side effects of TAK-951 when given as a single or multiple doses to healthy adults. Side effects are medical problems thought to be caused by the study treatment. Another aim is to learn how a healthy adult's body processes TAK-951 (this is called pharmacokinetics or PK). In this study, participants will receive either TAK-951 or placebo. The placebo looks like TAK-951 but does not have any medicine in it. Both TAK-951 and placebo will be given as an injection directly under the skin. This is called subcutaneous or subcutaneous (SC).

The study will be conducted in 3 parts:

* In Part 1, participants will be given one SC injection of either TAK-951 or placebo.
* In Part 2, participants will receive up to three daily SC injections of either TAK-951 or placebo of the same dose
* In Part 3, participants will receive one SC injection of either TAK-951 or placebo and another SC injection up to 1 week later.

The stones are removed by passing a small telescope through the side of the patient directly into the kidney, so the stone can be broken up and the fragments are removed .PCNL can be performed under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia. SA has some advantage over GA, such as lower postoperative pain, lower consumption of analgesic drugs and avoidance of side effects from multiple medications used in GA.However, SA induced sympathetic block leads to a decrease in the systemic vascular resistance and subsequent drop in the arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, anesthesia for PCNL usually requires a high sensory level reaching T4,resulting in a high incidence (nearly 33%) of hypotension. Also, to meet the long duration of surgery, drugs, ;like dexmedetomidine, are added to intrathecal local anesthetics , increasing the incidence of hemodynamic instability induced by the spinal anesthesia.

Decreasing the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and the venous return to the heart result in a reflex vasodilation, bradycardia and hypotension. This reflex is called Bezold -Jarisch reflex and is mediated by serotonin receptors (5_HT3) located on the vagus nerve and within the wall of the cardiac ventricles.

* Determine the clinical and pathologic significance of unstable DNA elements in colorectal cancer (tumor microsatellite instability).
* Determine the clinical and pathologic significance of loss of heterozygosity for chromosomes 5, 8, 17, and 18 (as the primary targets) and of chromosomes 1, 14, and 22 (as the secondary targets) in colorectal cancer.

OUTLINE: DNA is examined for unstable elements (microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity) by analyzing at least 10 separate (CA)n-repeats localized to 5 separate chromosomes (5q, 8p, 15, 17p, and 18q). Loss of heterozygosity is analyzed for at least four chromosomal arms (5q, 8p, 17p, and 18q) and later other chromosomes (e.g., 1, 14, and 22). Immunohistochemistry is used to test for the presence or absence of the genes involved in DNA mismatch repair (hMLH1 and hMSH2).

Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence the type or duration of treatment.

Massachusetts General Hospital,OTHER,NCT03542084,Endocrinology Auto-Triggered e-Consults,Impact of Endocrinology Auto-triggered E-consults on Glycemic Control,"Diabetes currently affects 25.8 million people in the U.S. Patients with diabetes are generally managed, at least initially, by a primary care practitioner (PCP). As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, PCPs are under increased pressure to achieve recommended glycemic targets. Failure to achieve these targets has been shown to increase clinical complications and cost of care.

Endocrinology referral is common for those patients not meeting A1c goals. Unfortunately, access to specialty endocrinology care is limited and patients routinely wait weeks or months before being seen. Electronic consultation (e-consult) is a new and innovative delivery model that has the potential to provide greater access to specialty care. The current system at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) allows PCPs to electively place an e-consult to solicit specialist input. Specialists in turn review the patients chart, relevant data and the clinical question and respond within the electronic medical record. E-consults have been well received by both patients and physicians, not only at MGH, but also across many centers in the US. With that said, the e-consult system remains in its infancy and current literature largely focuses on process metrics without hard clinical end-points.

One way to optimize care for patients with diabetes is to automatically trigger an endocrinology e-consult for those not meeting A1c targets.

"University Hospital, Toulouse",OTHER,NCT02164279,Validation of Biomarkers of Diabetic Nephropathy in Type I Diabetic Children,Identification and First Validation of Early Non-invasive Biomarkers of Diabetic Nephropathy in Type I Diabetic Children,"About 30 to 40% of patients suffering from type I diabetes are at risk of developing a diabetic nephropathy (DN) leading more or less rapidly to an end-stage renal disease. Nowadays, the microalbuminuria is the most often used clinical parameter for possible onset of DN. However, it is a late (because it permits to detect a renal disease already present), non-specific and low sensitive biomarker.

Therefore the main objective of this study is to identify early urinary biomarkers predictive of DN in children with type I diabetes, before the appearance of a microalbuminuria.","Once the type I diabetes is diagnosed, the speed of progression to a DN is very variable. Thus, the discovery of biomarkers able to distinguish progressor patients from non-progressor since the appearance of a microalbuminuria, is crucial in order to take care of progressor patients the earlier and to slow down the disease progression.

The investigators have shown that urine is a biological sample extremely well suited for proteome analysis with the aim to identify biomarkers of renal damages. Indeed, they were the first to analyze the urinary proteome of infant using capillary electrophoresis-coupled mass spectrometry. This technic permits to analyse the entire urinary proteome of a person in one hour.

Several laboratories tried to identify other predictive urinary biomarkers of the development of a DN in diabetic patients, but with limited success and nowadays in the clinical practice they still use the measure of the microalbuminuria. Contrary to precedent studies, the investigators develop an analysis without a priori and starting with early samples (without any signs of DN) associating the urinary peptide profile with the DN progression over 9-10 years.

This is a nested case-control study in a cohort of 317 patients constituting the urinary biological collection. (The urinary samples of a type I diabetic cohort of 317 patients seen between 2004 and 2008 have been collected.) These patients will be contacted at the end of 2012 to obtain a number of participation of 180 patients authorizing the use aposteriori of their urinary samples. Among this cohort, the investigators evaluate at 90 the number of patients with a DN defined by a dosage of microalbuminuria higher than 100 mg/L.

The primary endpoint of this study is therefore the identification of urinary biomarkers predictive of DN in type I diabetes pediatric patients.

The secondary endpoints are :

* The estimation of sensibility and specificity parameters, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC).

The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether the use of mycophenolate mofetil(MMF)/Cellcept® and tacrolimus(TAC)/Prograf® (Group 1) or mycophenolate mofetil(MMF)/Cellcept® and sirolimus/Rapamune® (Group 2) impacts the incidence of acute cellular rejection in post kidney transplant patients. This study will examine whether switching from tacrolimus to sirolimus will better preserve long-term kidney function.,"For this research study, between 6 and 24 Months post-transplant, we plan to prospectively randomize 2:1 renal transplant patients to either:

* Substitute tacrolimus (TAC) with sirolimus and continue mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or
* Continue with tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)

A total of 400 patients are expected to be screened for the randomization. We expect to randomize 275 renal transplant patients into this protocol (275 donors to be recruited).

The following data will be collected at the time of randomization:

Recipient demographics: (i) age at transplantation, (ii) sex, and (iii) race.

Clinical history: (i) causes of end-stage renal disease, and (ii) past medical history.

Transplant related information: (i) donor age, (ii) cadaveric versus living kidney transplant, (iii) histocompatibility and cross match data, (iv) viral serology, (v) history of acute rejection and delayed graft function, (vi) use of induction therapy and immunosuppressants, (vii) use of ACEI and/or ARB, and (viii) level of renal allograft function-estimated GFR (e-GFR(12) using MDRD formula, proteinuria.

Peripheral blood leukocytes will be obtained from renal transplant recipients for baseline (prior to randomization) lymphocytes functional activity and characterization of lymphocytes subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis.

Peripheral donor leukocytes (from living donor patients) will also be obtained at the time of randomization. These donor leukocytes will be used as stimulator cells to study the functional activity of the recipient's lymphocytes function.

The recipients assigned to continue with tacrolimus and MMF will be routinely followed at the outpatient Comprehensive Transplant Center (CTC) with monthly labs. In addition to labs at baseline pre-randomization, 6, 12 and 24 Months post-randomization, peripheral blood leukocytes will be obtained to study lymphocytes functional activity and to characterize lymphocytes subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis.

Post randomization: The recipients assigned to switch from tacrolimus to sirolimus and continue with MMF will be routinely followed at the CTC with monthly labs. During the period of conversion from tacrolimus to sirolimus, weekly labs will be obtained to monitor renal function and bone marrow function. In addition to labs at baseline pre-randomization, 6, 12 and 24 Months post-randomization, peripheral blood leukocytes will be obtained to study lymphocytes functional activity to characterize lymphocytes subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis. Urine will be collected to assess tubular toxicity by evaluating urinary biomarkers.

Both groups of patients will be followed for 2 years post-randomization. In addition to monitoring renal allograft function, we will evaluate the incidence of acute rejection, patient and graft survival, impact of CI conversion on the lipid profile, incidence of hypertension, malignancies, opportunistic infections, and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (DM). For those willing to undergo an optional kidney biopsy, one will be performed at the end of the second year in order to evaluate renal allograft pathology and renal allograft tissue gene expression profiles of the two groups.

With the peripheral leukocytes obtained at baseline prior to randomization and at 6, 12 and 24 Months post-randomization, we will investigate possible modifications of lymphocytes function and the lymphocytes subpopulations that might have occurred as a consequence of the switch from tacrolimus to sirolimus.

Obtaining renal allograft tissue samples at 24 months post randomization can have potential important ramifications to help explain the mechanisms of fibrosis and tubular atrophy typically associated with CI and the role of CI elimination with the substitution of sirolimus (SRL). All data will then be analyzed comparing gene expression profiles of peripheral blood (Pax gene tubes are routinely collected at the different time points as part of the original study). Based on power analysis, we will perform 24 months post randomization biopsies in 70% of the total subjects enrolled in the study (approximately 46 subjects from the tacrolimus/MMF group and approximately 93 subjects from the sirolimus/MMF group).

We plan to obtain renal allograft biopsies at 24 Months for those that consent for this additional biopsy. This will be compared to the standard of care 12 months post-transplant biopsy to allow us to address the effect of immunosuppressive modifications on renal allograft pathology at 24 months post randomization. Renal allograft biopsies will also be stored in RNA later to further extend our knowledge on the effect of CI free immunosuppression on gene expression profiles.","Inclusion Criteria:

The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether the use of mycophenolate mofetil(MMF)/Cellcept® and tacrolimus(TAC)/Prograf® (Group 1) or mycophenolate mofetil(MMF)/Cellcept® and sirolimus/Rapamune® (Group 2) impacts the incidence of acute cellular rejection in post kidney transplant patients. This study will examine whether switching from tacrolimus to sirolimus will better preserve long-term kidney function. For this research study, between 6 and 24 Months post-transplant, we plan to prospectively randomize 2:1 renal transplant patients to either: * Substitute tacrolimus (TAC) with sirolimus and continue mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or * Continue with tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) A total of 400 patients are expected to be screened for the randomization. We expect to randomize 275 renal transplant patients into this protocol (275 donors to be recruited). The following data will be collected at the time of randomization: Recipient demographics: (i) age at transplantation, (ii) sex, and (iii) race. Clinical history: (i) causes of end-stage renal disease, and (ii) past medical history. Transplant related information: (i) donor age, (ii) cadaveric versus living kidney transplant, (iii) histocompatibility and cross match data, (iv) viral serology, (v) history of acute rejection and delayed graft function, (vi) use of induction therapy and immunosuppressants, (vii) use of ACEI and/or ARB, and (viii) level of renal allograft function-estimated GFR (e-GFR(12) using MDRD formula, proteinuria. Peripheral blood leukocytes will be obtained from renal transplant recipients for baseline (prior to randomization) lymphocytes functional activity and characterization of lymphocytes subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis. Peripheral donor leukocytes (from living donor patients) will also be obtained at the time of randomization. These donor leukocytes will be used as stimulator cells to study the functional activity of the recipient's lymphocytes function. The recipients assigned to continue with tacrolimus and MMF will be routinely followed at the outpatient Comprehensive Transplant Center (CTC) with monthly labs. In addition to labs at baseline pre-randomization, 6, 12 and 24 Months post-randomization, peripheral blood leukocytes will be obtained to study lymphocytes functional activity and to characterize lymphocytes subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis. Post randomization: The recipients assigned to switch from tacrolimus to sirolimus and continue with MMF will be routinely followed at the CTC with monthly labs. During the period of conversion from tacrolimus to sirolimus, weekly labs will be obtained to monitor renal function and bone marrow function. In addition to labs at baseline pre-randomization, 6, 12 and 24 Months post-randomization, peripheral blood leukocytes will be obtained to study lymphocytes functional activity to characterize lymphocytes subpopulations by flow cytometry analysis. Urine will be collected to assess tubular toxicity by evaluating urinary biomarkers. Both groups of patients will be followed for 2 years post-randomization. In addition to monitoring renal allograft function, we will evaluate the incidence of acute rejection, patient and graft survival, impact of CI conversion on the lipid profile, incidence of hypertension, malignancies, opportunistic infections, and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (DM). For those willing to undergo an optional kidney biopsy, one will be performed at the end of the second year in order to evaluate renal allograft pathology and renal allograft tissue gene expression profiles of the two groups. With the peripheral leukocytes obtained at baseline prior to randomization and at 6, 12 and 24 Months post-randomization, we will investigate possible modifications of lymphocytes function and the lymphocytes subpopulations that might have occurred as a consequence of the switch from tacrolimus to sirolimus. Obtaining renal allograft tissue samples at 24 months post randomization can have potential important ramifications to help explain the mechanisms of fibrosis and tubular atrophy typically associated with CI and the role of CI elimination with the substitution of sirolimus (SRL). All data will then be analyzed comparing gene expression profiles of peripheral blood (Pax gene tubes are routinely collected at the different time points as part of the original study). Based on power analysis, we will perform 24 months post randomization biopsies in 70% of the total subjects enrolled in the study (approximately 46 subjects from the tacrolimus/MMF group and approximately 93 subjects from the sirolimus/MMF group). We plan to obtain renal allograft biopsies at 24 Months for those that consent for this additional biopsy. This will be compared to the standard of care 12 months post-transplant biopsy to allow us to address the effect of immunosuppressive modifications on renal allograft pathology at 24 months post randomization. Renal allograft biopsies will also be stored in RNA later to further extend our knowledge on the effect of CI free immunosuppression on gene expression profiles. Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Finding this optimal dose can take weeks in an ideal setting, but often takes much longer in a busy urban clinic such as Bellevue Hospital Center. Relaying titration instructions to patients via phone and text message has the potential to decrease the titration timeline, thus reducing the number of clinic visits and the time it takes patients to reach their target blood glucose levels.

For this pilot project, study staff will recruit patients who are initiating long-acting insulin treatment or initiating the titration of their existing long acting insulin treatment at Bellevue Hospital Center's Adult Primary Care Center. Patients who volunteer to enroll and provide informed consent will be randomized to one of two arms (MITI or current best practice arm) at the time of enrollment and stratified by whether the patient is initiating insulin treatment or initiating the titration of his/her existing insulin dose. The study staff will provide a cell phone (for temporary use) to any patients who are randomized to the MITI arm and don't own a personal cell phone (or whose personal cell phone is not able to receive the Sense Health text messages). Patients will use the cell phone free of cost to participate in the intervention (receive Sense Health text messages, send their fasting blood glucose levels, and speak with the diabetes nurse and study staff.)

Patients in the MITI arm will receive automated text messages 5 weekdays per week, for up to 12 weeks, from Sense Health. These text messages will request the patient's fasting blood glucose level. The patient will reply with his/her fasting blood glucose value, which will be logged in password-protected accounts on www.sensehealth.com.

We recently also found out that such stimulation enhances the ability of healthy brains to learn faster, enhancing the beneficial effects of the motor training.

The purpose of this study is to find out if this stimulation can enhance the ability of stroke patients to experience plastic changes in the brain. It may aid in the development of new strategies for rehabilitation after brain injury in the future.

A clinical and neurological exam will be administered. Each patient will participate in three different sessions separated by at least 48 hours: a 2-hour peripheral nerve stimulation to the weak hand, a 2-hour peripheral nerve stimulation to the leg, and no stimulation. The sessions will be randomly ordered. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain will be done as well.

Nerve stimulation will be done by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In TMS, the head is immobilized within a frame. An insulated coil wire is placed on the scalp and brief electrical current passed through it. Participants may be asked to perform movements, do simple tasks, or simply tense muscles. Electrical activity of the muscles will be recorded with a computer. Some experiments may be recorded on videotape.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),NIH,NCT01547884,Effect of Filarial Infection on Immune Responses in Latent Tuberculosis,Effect of Filarial Infection on Antigen-Specific Immune Responses in Latent Tuberculosis,"Background:

- Lymphatic filariasis is an infection that is caused by small, thread-like worms. It is spread by mosquitoes, and causes fever, chills, and headaches. If untreated, it can also cause elephantiasis, a condition that leads to swelling of the arms, legs, breasts, and scrotum. Treatment can eliminate the worms from the blood and reduce the risk of developing elephantiasis. Researchers want to study people with latent tuberculosis (TB) who may or may not be infected with filariasis. This study will look at the way that people with latent TB fight infection with these worms.

Objectives:

- To study how the immune systems of people with latent TB react to filarial infection.

Eligibility:

- Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have latent TB and may or may not have filarial infection.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will provide a blood and stool sample to test for infection.
* Participants who do not have lymphatic filariasis but have another kind of intestinal worm will be treated for the parasite. This will be their last study visit.
* Participants who have latent TB and lymphatic filariasis will be treated with the standard treatment for the disease. They will come back for a second visit 6 months later, and will provide another blood sample.","Tissue-invasive helminth parasites infect close to 500 million people worldwide and are associated with strong T helper (Th)2 responses and regulatory networks that downregulate potentially protective Th1 responses. The two common tissue invasive helminth parasites are Wuchereria bancrofti, that causes lymphatic filariasis and Strongyloides stercoralis, that causes stronyloidiasis. Previous studies have shown that the intestinal helminth coinfection is accompanied by lowered in vitro production of interferon-gamma and elevated production of interleukin 10 in individuals with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Our team has recently shown that co-existent filarial TB infections down-regulate Th1 and Th17 responses, which are necessary for protection against active TB.

The current study will compare immune responses to mycobacterial antigens in individuals with latent tuberculosis (LTBI+) and concomitant helminth infection (Hel+), including those with filarial (Fil+) and strongyloides (STR+) infection versus those with LTBI+ without concomitant helminth infection (Hel-). Immune responses to mycobacterial antigens from co-infected individuals will also be evaluated before and after treatment for helminth infection. Individuals (n=4000) will sign a screening consent prior to undergoing any study procedures. Every participant will have their medical history collected and will undergo a physical exam and a tuberculin 2TU purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test; women of childbearing potential will also undergo a urine pregnancy test, and those with positive test results will be excluded from the study. Individuals with positive PPD skin test results (\> or = 5 mm) and no symptoms of active TB will have their blood drawn (5 mL) as part of the screening procedures to confirm LTBI+ status, evaluate circulating filarial antigenemia, determine Strongyloides status by ELISA, measure hematocrit levels, and for storage of serum samples; those with PPD skin test results less than or equal to 5 mm will be excluded from the study. Individuals with positive symptoms for TB will also be excluded from the study, but sputum will be collected from them, and those with positive smears will be referred for treatment. Individuals will be matched for age, gender, and geographic location, and they will be assigned to one of two groups, LTBI+ Hel+ (n=100) or LTBI+ Hel- (n=100).

Within 3 months of screening, individuals will be asked to sign an on-study consent and will undergo a second blood draw (10 mL) for immunological investigations and storage of serum samples; women of childbearing potential will undergo a repeat urine pregnancy test, and those with positive test results will be excluded from further study. Stool samples will also be collected for microscopic evaluation of ova and parasites. LTBI+ Fil+ individuals will be treated with a single standard dose of albendazole (400 mg) and single standard dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate (300 mg), which are available through the National Programme for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis in India. LTBI+ STR+ individuals will be treated with a single standard dose of ivermectin (12mg) and a single standard dose of albendazole (400mg). These individuals will be asked to return 6 months after treatment to undergo a third blood draw (10 mL) for additional immunological investigations and storage of serum samples. LTBI+ Hel-individuals who test positive for other intestinal helminth infection will be treated with a single standard dose of albendazole (400 mg).","* PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA:

"Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Inc.",OTHER,NCT02801084,Effects of Reduced Environmental Stimulation on Eating Disorders,Examining the Effects of Reduced Environmental Stimulation on Eating Disorders,"The study proposed in this protocol aims to document the physiological, subjective, behavioral, and neural effects of reduced environmental stimulation (floating) in patients with current or prior anorexia nervosa The primary aim of this study is to determine the safety of this intervention. Secondary aims including determining whether floating has an impact on symptom reports such as those related to anxiety and eating disorders.","Floating creates an environment with minimal visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal input to the brain. The float rooms used in this study are both lightproof, and thus completely dark when the entry door is sealed and the lights are turned off, reducing all visual input to the brain. Each float room was constructed with thick soundproof walls, restricting most outside noises from entering the room, thereby reducing auditory input to the brain. A high concentration Epsom salt water solution allows individuals to effortlessly float on their back while remaining completely still, reducing both proprioceptive and tactile input to the brain. The temperature of the water is calibrated to the temperature of the skin (\~94° F) and the temperature of the air is calibrated to the temperature of the water, making it difficult to discern the boundary between air and water, thus reducing thermal input to the brain while minimizing the need for thermoregulation of the skin.

While both float pools dramatically reduce external sensory information, it is important to note that participants are in full control over the experience. For example, participants can enter and exit the float pool whenever they choose. Each float pool also contains a blue LED light that can be turned on and off via an air-coupled light switch in the pool. Both float rooms contain a shower for cleaning before and after floating.

In a prior study the investigators have found that healthy participants found the pool condition to be relaxing and stress relieving. The current study aims to determine the safety of floating with a clinical population, specifically individuals with a history of eating disorder who are of normal weight.","Inclusion Criteria:

Secondary aims including determining whether floating has an impact on symptom reports such as those related to anxiety and eating disorders. Floating creates an environment with minimal visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal input to the brain. The float rooms used in this study are both lightproof, and thus completely dark when the entry door is sealed and the lights are turned off, reducing all visual input to the brain. Each float room was constructed with thick soundproof walls, restricting most outside noises from entering the room, thereby reducing auditory input to the brain. A high concentration Epsom salt water solution allows individuals to effortlessly float on their back while remaining completely still, reducing both proprioceptive and tactile input to the brain. The temperature of the water is calibrated to the temperature of the skin (\~94° F) and the temperature of the air is calibrated to the temperature of the water, making it difficult to discern the boundary between air and water, thus reducing thermal input to the brain while minimizing the need for thermoregulation of the skin. While both float pools dramatically reduce external sensory information, it is important to note that participants are in full control over the experience. For example, participants can enter and exit the float pool whenever they choose. Each float pool also contains a blue LED light that can be turned on and off via an air-coupled light switch in the pool. Both float rooms contain a shower for cleaning before and after floating. In a prior study the investigators have found that healthy participants found the pool condition to be relaxing and stress relieving. The current study aims to determine the safety of floating with a clinical population, specifically individuals with a history of eating disorder who are of normal weight. Inclusion Criteria: 1.

Baylor Research Institute,OTHER,NCT03457779,Pilot Study To Investigate Targetable Metabolic Pathways Sustaining Triple Negative Breast Cancer,Pilot Study To Investigate Targetable Metabolic Pathways Sustaining Triple Negative (TN) Breast Cancer and Associated Genomic Alterations,"The primary objective is to describe and discover new insights into the glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolic dependencies of TNBC via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analysis of in vivo \[1,2-13C\] glucose-labeled breast cancer biopsies.

The secondary objectives are to correlate the dominant metabolic dependencies of TNBCs with pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy, and with the cancers' molecular signaling pathways assessed via NGS and RPPA.","One of the recognized hallmarks of cancer cells is deregulated cellular metabolism, characterized by enhanced metabolic autonomy compare with non-transformed cells. Tumor cells typically display an overall increase in glucose metabolism, associated with enhanced aerobic glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by a requirement for a high rate of protein, nucleotide, and fatty acid synthesis to provide the raw materials for cell division. 13C-glucose is a non-radioactive stable isotope tracer that has been widely used in vitro, in vivo, and in patients in a variety of disease settings to study glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, at steady state and following intervention. \[1,2-13C\] glucose can provide additional information on the activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway versus glycolysis. Administration of intravenous 13C-glucose is a convenient and affordable approach to analyzing the metabolomics of human cancers in their native microenvironments.

The metabolic dependencies of the various breast cancer subtypes are poorly understood. Importantly, in depth analyses of the in situ metabolic processes utilized by triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) using state-of-the-art in vivo \[1,2-13C\]-glucose infusions in patients with TNBC has never been done. In TNBC, oncogenic activation of key signaling pathways leads to altered metabolic programming resulting in an increased dependence on exogenous nutrients such as glucose and glutamine. These data further suggest a hypothesis that TNBCs may employ a cellular mechanism called macropinocytosis to ingest and degrade interstitial albumin to accumulate glutamine. This process may then be exploited for therapeutic gain through enhanced uptake by cells that utilize macropinocytosis to meet their metabolic requirements.

In this study, administration of \[1,2-13C\]-glucose to patients with TNBC will be done prior to patients undergoing a biopsy of their breast cancer as well as blood sample collection which will allow for in depth evaluation of glycolysis as well as lipid and amino acid metabolism by Joshua Rabinowitz, PhD, at Princeton University who is an international expert in cancer metabolomics. RAS and PI3K pathway and other genomic alterations as well as pathway activation status will be determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) and by reverse phase protein array (RPPA), and will be correlated with the metabolic findings, and both will be assessed in the context of the patients' response to standard preoperative chemotherapy.","Inclusion Criteria:

The secondary objectives are to correlate the dominant metabolic dependencies of TNBCs with pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy, and with the cancers' molecular signaling pathways assessed via NGS and RPPA. One of the recognized hallmarks of cancer cells is deregulated cellular metabolism, characterized by enhanced metabolic autonomy compare with non-transformed cells. Tumor cells typically display an overall increase in glucose metabolism, associated with enhanced aerobic glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by a requirement for a high rate of protein, nucleotide, and fatty acid synthesis to provide the raw materials for cell division. 13C-glucose is a non-radioactive stable isotope tracer that has been widely used in vitro, in vivo, and in patients in a variety of disease settings to study glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, at steady state and following intervention. \[1,2-13C\] glucose can provide additional information on the activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway versus glycolysis. Administration of intravenous 13C-glucose is a convenient and affordable approach to analyzing the metabolomics of human cancers in their native microenvironments. The metabolic dependencies of the various breast cancer subtypes are poorly understood. Importantly, in depth analyses of the in situ metabolic processes utilized by triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) using state-of-the-art in vivo \[1,2-13C\]-glucose infusions in patients with TNBC has never been done. In TNBC, oncogenic activation of key signaling pathways leads to altered metabolic programming resulting in an increased dependence on exogenous nutrients such as glucose and glutamine. These data further suggest a hypothesis that TNBCs may employ a cellular mechanism called macropinocytosis to ingest and degrade interstitial albumin to accumulate glutamine. This process may then be exploited for therapeutic gain through enhanced uptake by cells that utilize macropinocytosis to meet their metabolic requirements. In this study, administration of \[1,2-13C\]-glucose to patients with TNBC will be done prior to patients undergoing a biopsy of their breast cancer as well as blood sample collection which will allow for in depth evaluation of glycolysis as well as lipid and amino acid metabolism by Joshua Rabinowitz, PhD, at Princeton University who is an international expert in cancer metabolomics. RAS and PI3K pathway and other genomic alterations as well as pathway activation status will be determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) and by reverse phase protein array (RPPA), and will be correlated with the metabolic findings, and both will be assessed in the context of the patients' response to standard preoperative chemotherapy.

NHS Tayside,OTHER_GOV,NCT02733679,Response of Individuals With Ataxia-Telangiectasia to Metformin and Pioglitazone,Response of Individuals With Ataxia-Telangiectasia to Metformin and Pioglitazone,"This study aims to investigate the link between the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene and metformin response. This link has been identified from large studies of the human genome, and this study aims to confirm this link in a clinical study. The ATM gene is involved in DNA repair - if a person inherits a ""faulty"" copy of this gene from both their parents, they have a genetic condition called Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T).

A-T is associated with, among other things, a resistance to insulin, which causes fatty liver and diabetes. This study will recruit people who have A-T, but have not developed diabetes, and compare this group to ""healthy"" controls, i.e. people who do not have A-T or diabetes. The study will compare how the groups respond to two drugs used to treat diabetes (metformin and pioglitazone), with the intention that this will guide the management of diabetes in A-T.

This is an, open label unblinded study recruiting 15 people with A-T and 15 age and gender matched controls. Each participant will have three study visits to the Clinical Research Centre at Ninewells hospital in Dundee - one at baseline, a second after 8 weeks of metformin and the final visit after eight weeks of pioglitazone. During each visit we will carry out a number of investigations to study the insulin resistance of A-T and how it responds to metformin and pioglitazone.","Metformin is a commonly-prescribed drug, used as first-line medical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but also off-license in non-diabetics for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Over 120 million people worldwide are prescribed metformin. Despite this, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Both tolerance of and response to metformin varies greatly from patient to patient, and highlights the need for further research into the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the drug.

As a team of diabetes researchers, our group have been interested in the genetics of drug response in diabetes. A Genome Wide Association Study carried out by members of our group highlighted the locus carrying the ATM gene as a potential link to metformin response. We have designed this study to investigate this link clinically. In doing so we hope to guide the management of diabetes in a condition called Ataxia Telangiectasia.

ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) is a gene involved in DNA repair - homozygous recessive mutations in this gene cause Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T), which is associated with cerebellar ataxia, ocular telangiectasia and lymphoproliferative cancers. The incidence of A-T is between 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births, though this increases dramatically with consanguineous parents. Interestingly, A-T has also been associated with insulin resistance. Both ""fatty liver"" and diabetes have been documented in this patient group, but there is little research into the link between A-T and these conditions. Approximately 1 in 100 people are carriers of a loss of function mutation in the ATM gene, which is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic heart disease and certain cancers.

Several studies of ATM deficiency in a mouse model have been carried out. Atm -/- mice display an early defect in glucose-stimulated insulin release and later develop hyperglycaemia, and insulin resistance\[1\]. Unpublished data from the McCrimmon Group at University of Dundee suggest that mice heterozygous for ATM deficiency have impaired fasting glucose, but demonstrated a marked improvement in fasting glucose with metformin. A Cell Reports paper, detailing a mouse model of ATM deficiency, demonstrates insulin resistance in ATM deficient mice, with a lipodystrophic phenotype\[2\]. This phenotype (paucity of subcutaneous fat, and increased visceral fat) was attenuated by metformin and thiazolidinedione (TZD) use.

A small study published by the Pearson group from University of Dundee, which compared data from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in A-T patients versus healthy individuals, confirmed increased insulin resistance in A-T patients\[3\]. As mentioned above, a genome wide association study, also by the Pearson group, highlights the ATM locus as a potential genetic link to metformin response\[4, 5\]. With the mouse models and information from genetic studies, this study now aims to assess insulin resistance in this A-T patient group, and to understand how they respond to drugs commonly used to treat insulin resistance / diabetes.

The potential genetic link between ATM and metformin response will be investigated. Thus far it is unclear from the genetic studies how ATM deficiency affects an individual's metformin response - is their response greater or less than that of the general population? Similarly, magnitude of this response has not been quantified. There are anecdotal reports of patients with A-T who have had a marked improvement in glycaemic control with metformin use. Mouse model studies have indicated an increased response to metformin in heterozygous ATM deficient mice.

The study will also investigate the response of individuals with A-T to TZDs. Studies of the mouse model of A-T has demonstrated response to the TZD pioglitazone,. Of note, pioglitazone is now used off-licence in non-diabetics for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) \[6, 7\], therefore we know it is safe for use in a non-diabetic cohort.

This study will assess the effect of ATM deficiency on metformin and pioglitazone response in humans, by studying people with A-T, and comparing their response to that of a matched control group.

This study will recruit non-diabetic individuals - 15 cases (people with A-T) vs 15 age and gender matched controls - in a crossover design. Participants will be 18 - 30 years of age. This age group is most realistic for recruiting patients with ""classic"", as opposed to ""mild variant"" A-T, as people with classic A-T rarely survive to their 30s. Exclusion of individuals with other milder forms of A-T will provide a more detectable difference between the two cohorts. Participants will be of white European descent, as this will narrow the genetic differences between individuals. Ethnic origin also has an effect on an individual's insulin resistance, therefore all the participants should be of the same ethnicity.

The study is made up of two treatment periods each lasting eight weeks, and separated by a one week washout period. Initial treatment shall be with metformin, titrated to 1000mg twice daily. The second treatment will be pioglitazone titrated to 30mg once daily.

The study will last a total of approximately 17 weeks, and involves three visits to the Clinical Research Centre at Ninewells hospital in Dundee. The first visit will be the longest, lasting 1.5 days, and the other two visits last one full day with a short preparatory visit for 30 minutes the day before.

Multiple methods will be used to investigate the relationship between ATM, diabetes and drug response:

* Dual tracer mixed meal tests with indirect calorimetry (see Tracer Studies SOP)
* MRI (see MRI SOP)
* Blood and urine sampling (see Sample Collection SOP)
* Fat biopsy (see Fat Biopsy SOP)

In summary, each individual will have three tracer studies: an initial study at baseline; a second after eight weeks of metformin; and a final tracer study after eight weeks of the TZD, pioglitazone. Tracer studies involve a standardised meal the night before the study, and fasting from midnight in preparation. No alcohol should be consumed for 24 hours before the study. On the day of the tracer study two cannulae will be inserted, one in each forearm. One cannula will be used to infuse a stable glucose tracer \[6,6-2H2\] for the duration of the eight hour study. After two hours of this infusion, the participant will be fed a mixed meal containing \[U-13C\] glucose (stable). The participant is observed for a further six hours, while the \[6,6-2H2\] glucose infusion continues. Throughout the tracer study, blood will be taken from the second cannula at multiple time-points, to allow for measurement of glucose (including the tracers), insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs). A total of 150ml of blood will be taken during the tracer study. Urine is collected in two phases (before and after the meal) during the tracer study, for the measurement of glucose excretion. Indirect calorimetry will be used for twenty minute episodes at several time-points to measure substrate utilisation during the study. This involves the participant wearing a ""hood"" which is lightweight, and has a see-through visor. All of these measurements will enable us to model glucose fluxes in the participant and calculate indices of insulin sensitivity. Repetition of the tracer studies on two anti-hyperglycaemic agents will provide comparison of these indices on and off treatment.

At the baseline visit an MRI, blood sampling and fat biopsy will take place during the half day visit before the tracer study. This will allow us to assess fat distribution using MRI and obtain adipose tissue to carry out lab-based studies to assess the adipocyte function and response to metformin and pioglitazone. Blood samples are taken for ""safety bloods"" (i.e. to ensure normal renal function and HbA1c \<48mmol/mol) but also for future DNA analysis, to confirm the diagnosis in the A-T group, and to check for carrier status of the controls.

Visits two and three involve a full day at the clinical research centre (CRC) for a tracer study. On the day before the tracer, a short half-hour visit to obtain ""safety bloods"" (in this case, to check renal function) and provide the standardised meal is necessary to prepare for the tracer study the following day.

If this study can clinically confirm the hypothesis that individuals with ATM-deficiency respond well to either metformin or pioglitazone, and individuals show marked improvement in insulin resistance while taking either study drug, this study could direct clinical decision-making in the care of patients with A-T and fatty liver / insulin resistance.

In conjunction with the clinical studies cell experiment studies will be carried out on induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC) derived hepatocytes from individuals with A-T, to assess drug response at a cellular level. This will be a collaboration with the Sanger Institute in Cambridge, where they have already developed IPSC-derived hepatocytes from the blood of A-T patients. These cells will be used to create a drug response model at a cellular level. These cell lines are not from our recruited patients directly, but serve as a cellular model of A-T. However, we will offer the A-T group the chance to donate blood to the INSIGNIA study, run by the Sanger Institute, which is a study focused on the investigation of patterns of mutations (signatures) in inherited and other progressive genetic diseases (please see INSIGNIA PIS and consent forms). This is optional and taking part in RAMP does not commit those with A-T to contributing to INSIGNIA.","Inclusion Criteria:

Recently, cardiac surgery has benefited from newer US guided interfascial techniques as they promise to fulfil all the prerequisites of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) strategy(1,2).

Hence, the scope of this trial is to investigate the effects on perioperative opioid consumption and several other secondary outcomes of a minimalist approach encompassing a bilateral single shot ESP block when applied as an adjunct to general anaesthesia.","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STUDY

A. Ethics

Local Ethics Committee approval and Informed Consent from patient or next-of-kin are obtained prior to study enrolment.

B. Study enrolment

Eighty adult patients scheduled for elective open cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia (GA) are randomly allocated to receive either GA plus ESP block (ESP group, n = 40) or GA alone (control group, n = 40).

C. Methods - Preinduction

1. Premedication with intramuscular morphine 0.1mg/kg 30 minutes before induction.
2. 16-G peripheral intravenous cannula and radial artery catheter.
3. Five-lead ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive and invasive blood pressure monitoring.
4. Analgesia monitor - the NoL index (PMD200TM, Medasense) finger probe will be connected to the index finger of the non-cannulated hand.
5. Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (Cefuroxime 1.5g)
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis (omeprazole 40 mg)

D. Methods - ESP block (intervention group only)

Before induction, patients in the intervention group are placed in sitting position under the close supervision of the attending nurse anaesthetist. After skin asepsis with chlorhexidine 2%, a high-frequency linear ultrasound probe is positioned parasagittally, 2-3 cm from midline, bilaterally, at the level of the T5 transverse process. A 25-G echogenic block needle is inserted at 20⁰-30⁰ in a caudal-to-cephalad direction until the tip of the needle reaches the interfascial plane between the erector spinae muscle and the inter-transverse ligaments. Correct hydrodissection at T5 level is first certified using normal saline. Subsequently, ropivacaine 0.5% with dexamethasone 8mg/20ml is used and maximum spread is attained by slowly advancing the needle as the interfascial plane splits up ahead. A maximum dose of 3mg/kg ropivacaine is used, corresponding to 1.5 mg/kg per side (e.g., 20 ml ropivacaine 0.5% / side for a 70kg adult). Supine position is resumed after completion of block.

E. Methods - General anaesthesia

1. End tidal CO2 (ETCO2).
2. Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring of hypnotic depth (target 40-60).
3. The nociception monitor (PMD200TM, Medasense) is started after induction of general anaesthesia; a calibration period of 1-2 minutes is usually required.
4. CVP insertion into the right internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance. Any other hemodynamic monitor deemed useful is left at the discretion of the treating anaesthetist.
5. Urinary catheter, rectal temperature probe placement.
6. Intubating conditions

   6.1. Propofol 1-1.5 mg/kg or Etomidate 0.2-0.3 mg/kg.

   6.2. Fentanyl 5 mcg/kg.

   6.3. Atracurium 0.5 mg/kg.
7. Maintenance of anaesthesia

7.1. Sevoflurane in O2 during periods of preserved pulmonary blood flow and mechanical ventilation according to BIS (see target above).

7.2. Propofol infusion according to BIS (see target above) during periods of extracorporeal support.

7.3. Atracurium 0.2-0.3 mg/kg/h for adequate neuromuscular blockade.

7.4. Management of analgesia divides in:

7.4.1. Analgesia support

7.4.1.1. ESP block in the intervention group only:

• Theoretical duration of ESP block with surgical intensity is 4-6 hours.

7.4.1.2. Fentanyl (both study groups):

* Analgesia monitoring (see below) provides feedback to its administration.
* Administration follows a combination of continuous infusion and bolus dosing according to our local protocol:

  * Fentanyl 1.5 mg/50ml (30 mcg/ml).
  * Bolus dose (ml): Weight/20, which is equivalent to 1.5 mcg/kg.
  * Infusion rate (ml/hour): Weight/10, which is equivalent to 3 mcg/kg/h.
  * Last infusion rate before large vessel cannulation is maintained throughout the bypass period.

7.4.1.3. Paracetamol (both study groups):

• Administration of 2 grams following induction of general anaesthesia.

7.4.2. Analgesia monitoring

7.4.2.1. NoL index provides a multiderivative assessment of nociception before large vessel cannulation; depending on the spontaneous cardiac rhythm, it may be expected to continue reflecting nociception even after completion of extracorporeal circulation.

* Optimal analgesia is defined as a NoL index of 10-25.
* Allow periods of fluctuation of less than 1 minute.
* After sternotomy, allow a maximum fluctuation interval of 3 minutes before vital data are gathered.
* In the ESP group, if NOL target is attained, stop fentanyl administration.

7.4.2.2. Ancillaries such as mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) provide complementary decision loops: targets are within ± 20% of preoperative baseline.

* During CBP they provide the only feedback on adequacy of analgesia, although highly unspecific.
* May be used at any time to complement the NoL index.

The investigators believe data generated from this exploratory feasibility study may serve to further inform a larger study involving the use of music therapy in the cardiac intensive care.","A predetermined recording of a music playlist meeting the properties of sedative music is being developed in consultation with a Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) music therapist. Properties of sedative music include soothing, stable, constant, and relatively unchanging, slow tempo and light rhythmic emphasis, constant volume and rhythm, lullaby style, repetitious and no separate melody for chorus/bridge. The music recorded for the neonates has been produced specifically for this study. In accordance with the recommendations for soothing music, BCH Music Therapists have recorded English nursery rhymes (Figure 1) in the key of C major at 60bpm with acoustic guitar and voice.

The literature supports a duration of up to 30 minutes of music therapy followed by at least 30 minutes of silence, with a maximum of four hours per day. Music played for longer than 30 minutes has the potential to be a source of over-stimulation/agitation. There is some evidence to suggest that playing music for long periods of time (two four-hour segments) has a negative effect. In addition, it seems reasonable and likely to assume that the neonate could have a period of 30 minutes when they will not require an intervention associated with post-operative care.

European Association for Endoscopic Surgery,OTHER,NCT01023984,Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery Versus Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection For Large Rectal Adenomas,,"Objective: Recent non-randomized studies suggest that extended endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is equally effective in removing large rectal adenomas as transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). If equally effective, ESD might be a more cost-effective approach as this strategy does not require expensive equipment, general anesthesia and hospital admission. Furthermore, ESD appears to be associated with fewer complications. In a randomized trial we will compare the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of TEM and ESD for the resection of large rectal adenomas.

Study design: 15 centers will participate in this multicenter randomized trial comparing TEM versus ESD.

Study population: Patients with a large rectal adenoma (≥2cm), located between 2 and 15 cm from the anal verge. Invasive cancer is excluded by histopathology and endoscopic ultrasonography. Patients must be in a health condition that permits general anesthesia.

Interventions: Patients will be randomized between

a. TEM: under general anesthesia b. ESD under sedation

1. a TEM tube will be inserted in the rectum. With specialized instruments the adenoma will be dissected en bloc by a full thickness excision, after which the patient will be admitted to the hospital.
2. an endoscope will be inserted into the rectum and the submucosa underneath the lesion will be injected with saline to lift the adenoma. With an endoscopic knife (Insulated Tip Knife, Olympus or Water Jet, Erbe) the lesion will be resected through the submucosal plane in an eb-bloc fashion, after which the patient will be observed for at least 24h in-hospital.

Primary Endpoint: incidence of recurrence at 12 months

Secondary Endpoints:

Sample size: Assuming a comparable baseline recurrence rate for TEM and ESD of 6% and considering an upper limit of 10% for ESD to be non-inferior (beta-error 0.2 and one-sided alpha-error 0.05), 60 patients are needed per group. These numbers provide sufficient power to reveal relevant differences in expected morbidity and in number of days not spent in hospital.

Economic evaluation: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of ESD against TEM for large rectal adenomas from a societal perspective with respectively the costs per recurrence free patient and the cost per quality adjusted life year as primary outcome measures.","PROBLEM DEFINITION Rectal cancer is a common disease in Western countries, increased with high age, male sex and obesity (1,2). As for other districts, premalignant intraepithelial neoplasia inside a rectal adenoma precedes the occurrence of invasive rectal cancer (3,4). Early endoscopic detection and removal of rectal adenomas prevents the development of rectal cancer and is therefore the most reliable contributor to the 'cure' of this disease (5,6). When rectal adenomas become large, however, standard endoscopic therapies like loop polypectomy or one-step endoscopic resection result inadequate. Therefore, large rectal adenomas must be removed en-bloc either surgically or by extended endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).

In 1983 a novel surgical approach for the resection of large rectal adenomas has been introduced in the clinical practice in Germany: Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM).(7) This procedure encompasses general anesthesia and the use of expensive specialized equipment. On the other hand, it generally allows a full-thickness rectal wall excision. Since its introduction, many surgical practices have adopted TEM as the new standard therapy for large rectal adenomas (8). In more recent years advanced endoscopic therapies like extended ESD have rapidly evolved.(9).

For extended ESD an en-bloc specimen, including mucosa and consistent portion of the submucosal layer, are resected instead of the full-thickness rectal wall, combining the advantages of an en-bloc resection with potential benefit of fewer complications.

Supporters of the TEM technique praise the excellent exposure of the rectum and the minimal invasiveness, as opposed to conventional surgical techniques.(10-12) Besides, recurrence rates after TEM appear to be lower when compared to conventional surgical transanal excision.(13) The TEM technique has shown to be highly efficacious in several retrospective and prospective case series with reported recurrence rates of 0-19% and complication rates of 2-21%.(14-23) On the other hand, extended ESD has gained more and more support in the last few years, mainly due to good clinical results after ESD of neoplasia in the esophagus and stomach as reported in Japanese centers (24,25) ESD has also been described for the treatment of large colorectal adenomas, revealing recurrence rates of 0-9% and complication rates of only 0-9% (9,27). If adenomas could not be removed completely during one ESD attempt, repeat ESD for residual disease generally led to an overall success rate of 96-100%. In general, all recurrences were detected during the first control endoscopy after 3 months; repeat endoscopic resection of residual disease led to an overall success rate of almost 100%.

Since the efficacy of extended ESD for large rectal adenomas appears to be comparable to TEM, we decided to design this randomized trial. In fact, until now, TEM and ESD have never been formally compared, and no such comparative studies have been registered at this moment. Although selection bias inevitably exists in prospective and retrospective case series, the results of these studies suggest that both TEM and ESD have comparable recurrence rates. Even when recurrences occur after TEM or ESD, most of these can successfully be re-treated without the need for radical surgery. The literature furthermore suggests that ESD is associated with fewer complications, reduced hospital admission, and no general anesthesia is required for ESD, all of which are favorable in both patients' and societal perspective. These contrasts of the two procedures might well lead to differences in costs and quality of life. Therefore, we designed a multicentre randomized trial to compare TEM and ESD for the resection of large rectal adenomas.

RELEVANCE Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in Western countries. Rectal cancer accounts for approximately 40% of CRC cases. The treatment of rectal cancer encompasses a multidisciplinary collaboration including gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, radiotherapists and specialized nurse practitioners. Standard therapy consists of radical surgery in combination with radiotherapy (and possibly chemotherapy), which have major morbidity and mortality (28). Therefore, this disease has a major impact on health care services (29).

Since early detection and removal of rectal adenomas prevents the occurrence of rectal cancer, CRC screening has been adopted in many western countries (30). When CRC screening was introduced, this inevitably lead to an increased detection of early rectal neoplasia (31). It is therefore expected that more rectal adenomas will need endoscopic or surgical treatment in the forthcoming years. Consequently, the most appropriate therapy concerning efficacy, safety, quality of life and costs must be selected to deal with the expected increase in rectal adenomas.

Traditionally, adenomatous colorectal lesions that could not be resected endoscopically were referred for surgery. Conventional surgical approaches like radical surgery and trans-sphincteric or trans-sacral operations have nowadays been replaced by TEM, since this procedure has higher efficacy and lower morbidity. In recent years endoscopic therapies have further evolved, as a result of which large rectal adenomas more often are treated by flexible endoscopy. In case series, endoscopic resection of large colorectal adenomas has led to recurrence rates that were slightly higher than to TEM (18.0% versus 6%), but all retreated endoscopically, and to complication rates that appeared to be low and equivalent if not slightly lower (4% versus 8%) (32). Furthermore, ESD can safely be performed under conscious sedation, and short hospital admission is required as opposed to TEM. The reduced morbidity, reduced hospital admission and redundancy of anesthesia associated with ESD are beneficial from both patients' and societal perspective.

OBJECTIVE Hypothesis Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and extended endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are both effective treatments for large rectal adenomas with comparable recurrence rates. However, ESD does not require general/spinal anesthesia and may be associated with lower morbidity. Therefore, ESD may improve quality of life and reduce health care costs.

Objective The main objective of the proposed randomized study is to compare the effectiveness of TEM and ESD for the removal of large rectal adenomas.

Primary Endpoint: incidence of recurrence at 3 months

Secondary Endpoints:

morbidity, subdivided into major (requiring surgery) and minor (requiring endoscopic or medical intervention) anorectal function. disease specific and general quality of life; number of days not spent in hospital from initial treatment until 12 months

STRATEGY Design This will be a multicentre randomized trial comparing TEM and ESD in patients with large rectal adenomas with respect to cost-effectiveness and safety.

Randomization Patient data are entered into a computerized database and by means of an unchangeable computer generated number patients will be randomized to undergo TEM or ESD.

Blinding Blinding of patients and physicians during treatment is unfeasible, since the two treatment strategies are highly different in nature and in associated care.

Study population

Patients are eligible for this trial when they meet the following inclusion criteria:

Diagnosed with a large non-pedunculated rectal adenoma (sessile or flat) with a largest diameter of ≥2 cm (estimated by an opened resection snare of 20 or 30 mm).

The lower and upper borders of the adenoma are located at ≥2 cm and ≤15 cm from the anal verge, respectively.

Biopsies of the lesion did not show malignant neoplastic tissue on histopathological evaluation; only lesions with low or high grade dysplasia are suitable for inclusion.

During flexible video endoscopy there are no signs of endoscopic suspicion for submucosal invasive cancer (Kudo pit pattern type V; excavated/depressed type morphology; fold convergence; or large smooth nodule \>1 cm in a flat lesion) (33). In case of doubt, patients will undergo EUS as described at (2).

In case doubt remains after flexible video endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of the rectal adenoma should exclude invasion into the submucosal layer and exclude pathological lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes \>1 cm). When pathological lymph nodes are present, fine needle aspiration will be performed to exclude lymph node metastasis (N+ disease).

If not performed already, total colonoscopy will be done to detect and remove all synchronous colonic adenomas or cancers first. Cecal intubation must be confirmed by identification of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve.

The general health condition of the patient permits general anesthesia (ASA- classification I-III).

Absence of non-correctable coagulopathy (international normalized ratio \>1,5, or platelet count \<90 × 109/l).

Patient age of 18 years or older.

Intervention strategies Transanal endoscopic microsurgery: TEM will be performed as described by Buess.(7) Under general anesthesia a specialized TEM rectoscope of 12 or 20 cm in length (Wolf GmbH Knittlingen) or 15 cm in length (Storz GmbH Tuttlingen, Germany) is inserted within the rectum to assure proper visualization of the lesion. The rectoscope is fixed to the operating table by a supporting device, providing the opportunity to reposition the rectoscope during ongoing surgery. The rectal cavity is insufflated with CO2 by a combined endosurgical unit to achieve constant distension for appropriate visualization of the rectal adenoma. The combined endosurgical unit further regulates irrigation and suction, thereby maintaining a constant intra rectal pressure. With the use of a binocular stereoscopic eyepiece for three-dimensional view (Wolf GmbH only) or a forward oblique telescope (Storz GmbH) a magnified view is being created for visualization of the lesion. With various HF monopolar and bipolar instruments, Ultracision harmonic scalpel (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, USA), needle diathermy, tissue handling forceps, needle holder, suction probe, injection needle, clip applicator) the adenoma will be dissected by means of an en-bloc full-thickness rectal wall excision until the perirectal fat. Postoperatively, patients will preserve a urinary catheter that will be removed at the first postoperative day. Patients are admitted to the hospital in accordance with current practice.

After 3 months a control flexible endoscopy will be performed by the surgeon who performed the TEM procedure. If presumed residual disease is seen, biopsies will be taken to confirm the presence of neoplasia by histology. Hereafter, the residual adenomatous tissue will be resected endoscopically by either ESD (if \>20 mm) or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (if \<20mm). Any intervention by ESD/EMR at 3 months is part of the TEM treatment strategy.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection: Endoscopic submucosal dissection is performed as described by Fujiro (9) At the discretion of the endoscopist, conscious sedation is used with 2.5-10 mg midazolam and/or 25-100 µg of fentanyl. An endoscope is inserted into the rectum and air insufflation via the endoscope will provide proper distension of the rectum. The submucosa underneath the lesion will be injected through an endoscopic injection catheter with a solution of saline 0.9%, 1 ml methylene blue, and 1:10,000 units adrenaline in order to lift the adenoma (no upper volume limit). The lesion will be marked around with a 5 mm disease free margin by APC dots. An endoscopic knife (Insulated Tip Knife, Olympus or Water Jet, Erbe) will be used to resect the lesion through the submucosal plane in an en-bloc fashion. Visible submucosal vessels will be treated by endoscopic clips or electro-coagulation to prevent delayed bleeding. Hereafter, the edges of the mucosal defect and potential remnants within the resection crater will always be treated with APC to increase adenoma clearance. If bleeding during the procedure precludes \>90% clearance of the adenoma, the ESD procedure will be considered as failure. All patients are admitted to the hospital for at least 24-hours observation; in accordance with current practice.

After 3 months the treating endoscopist will perform a control endoscopy. If presumed residual disease is seen, biopsies will be taken to confirm the presence of neoplasia by histology. Hereafter, the residual adenomatous tissue will be resected endoscopically by either ESD (if \>20 mm) or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (if \<20mm). Any intervention by ESD/EMR at 3 months is part of the TEM treatment strategy.

Intervention failure When for technical reasons ESD procedures turn out not to be performable after randomization or when ESD fails to remove \>90% of the adenoma, the patient will automatically undergo the TEM treatment strategy.

Histopathological evaluation Resection specimens after TEM and ESD will be stretched and pinned on a cork plate before immersion into formalin. After standard processing the resection specimen will be transected each cm for evaluation by a gastrointestinal pathologist. The lateral and basal resection margins will be evaluated for absence of neoplasia, when possible.

The risk of lymph node metastases is increased in case of malignant neoplasia extending into the submucosal layer, poor tumor differentiation, mucinous cancer, vascular invasion and tumor budding, all of which warrant further radical surgery (34-37). By strict adherence to the inclusion criteria, the risk of invasive cancer is reduced to 1.6-3% (33,38). In case of an unexpected invasive cancer despite adherence to the inclusion criteria, the patient will be excluded after the histopathological evaluation (late exclusion). In case of intramucosal cancer (i.e. not invading through the muscularis mucosae), both TEM and ESD will be regarded as sufficient treatment when the lesion is radically removed.

Outcome parameters

Primary outcome measure (for non-inferiority):

Recurrence of neoplasia, defined as the presence of histologically proven neoplastic tissue in either visible recurrent lesions or in random biopsies, taken at surveillance endoscopies after the intervention strategy has been completed.

Any remnant adenoma identified and treated by ESD/EMR/APC at 3 months is considered part of the initial intervention strategy in both arms. Hereafter, patients will undergo surveillance endoscopies at 6 and 12 months by an independent endoscopist who is blinded for the primary treatment. During each surveillance endoscopy recurrence will objectively be defined by the Higaki criteria for recurrence: tumor appearing within a clear resection scar; tumors with convergent folds; and tumors nearby a clear resection scar (within 5 mm).(39) Targeted biopsies will be taken for histological confirmation; in case of an apparently healed normal scar without evidence of recurrence, biopsies will be taken from the basis and 3 from the edges of the scar to detect occult recurrent neoplasia.

The following standardized discharge criteria will be applied in all participating hospitals: normal intake of nutrition; normal mobility; absence of fever (\<38°C); and stable hemoglobin level during 1 day (\<1 mmol/L) in case of rectal blood loss.

Additional outcome measures:

1. Complications: subdivided into procedural (during treatment) and delayed complications (after ending the procedure); and further subdivided into major (requiring additional surgery) and minor (requiring endoscopic or medical intervention) complications.

   During admission patients will be monitored for complications. In case of same day discharge from the hospital patients will be called by telephone 1 day after the procedure whether adverse events have happened. Two weeks after the intervention, a research nurse will contact the patient by telephone again and ask for occurred complications.
2. Generic and disease-specific health related quality of life will be measured at baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 and year follow-up by the SF-36 and Wexner score (for incontinence) questionnaires.
3. Measurement of anorectal functional outcome by anal manometry and rectal volumetry (barostat) before and 3 months after treatment.
4. Costs of TEM and ESD from a societal perspective, based on primary data (see economic evaluation section).
5. Patient preferences regarding TEM or ESD will be measured at the end of follow-up by a structured questionnaire to enable a discrete choice experiment addressing the burden of care, burden of complications, prognostic uncertainties, and recurrence rates of both treatments.

Sample size calculation Assuming a baseline recurrence rate of 6% for both TEM and ESD (average recurrence based on a systematic review) and considering an upper limit of 10% for ESD to be non-inferior, with a β-error of 0.2 and α-error of 0.05, 60 patients are needed per randomization group.

Since ESD is known to be effective in even more than 2 attempts, an upper limit of 10% seems reasonable, whereas higher recurrence rates would lead to many additional procedures which renders this strategy impracticable and probably not cost-effective.

Patient recruitment Consecutive eligible patients will be recruited at the outpatient clinic in the participating centers by the involved physician (surgeon/gastroenterologist). All patients fulfilling the above-mentioned criteria will be informed about the study by the physician. After consent is given, central randomization will take place web-based and patients will be treated according to the study protocol. Patients unable or refusing to provide informed consent will be treated according to current clinical guidelines.

Data-analysis Since the main outcome of this study is the neoplasia recurrence rate, i.e. proportion of patients with recurrent disease, the Chi-square test will be used to compare the intervention groups (TEM versus ESD). Since the event of recurrence, and not time to recurrence, is the most important indicator for treatment failure, Kaplan Meier methods will not be used. The complication and mortality rates will be compared in the same manner. The number of days not spent in hospital as additional primary outcome measure will be compared by the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

Differences between the intervention groups in continuous outcome measures (e.g. Wexner incontinence scale, quality of life questionnaires, and manometry/volumetry) will be tested by the student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, where appropriate. All analyses will be carried out primarily on an intention-to-treat basis.

Time schedule Patients will be recruited for this study from October 2009 until December 2010 in all participating centers. All randomized patients will be followed up for 12 months (until December 2011). The last 3 months (until March 2012) will be used for statistical analysis and reporting of data.","Inclusion Criteria:

RELEVANCE Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in Western countries. Rectal cancer accounts for approximately 40% of CRC cases. The treatment of rectal cancer encompasses a multidisciplinary collaboration including gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, radiotherapists and specialized nurse practitioners. Standard therapy consists of radical surgery in combination with radiotherapy (and possibly chemotherapy), which have major morbidity and mortality (28). Therefore, this disease has a major impact on health care services (29). Since early detection and removal of rectal adenomas prevents the occurrence of rectal cancer, CRC screening has been adopted in many western countries (30). When CRC screening was introduced, this inevitably lead to an increased detection of early rectal neoplasia (31). It is therefore expected that more rectal adenomas will need endoscopic or surgical treatment in the forthcoming years. Consequently, the most appropriate therapy concerning efficacy, safety, quality of life and costs must be selected to deal with the expected increase in rectal adenomas. Traditionally, adenomatous colorectal lesions that could not be resected endoscopically were referred for surgery. Conventional surgical approaches like radical surgery and trans-sphincteric or trans-sacral operations have nowadays been replaced by TEM, since this procedure has higher efficacy and lower morbidity. In recent years endoscopic therapies have further evolved, as a result of which large rectal adenomas more often are treated by flexible endoscopy. In case series, endoscopic resection of large colorectal adenomas has led to recurrence rates that were slightly higher than to TEM (18.0% versus 6%), but all retreated endoscopically, and to complication rates that appeared to be low and equivalent if not slightly lower (4% versus 8%) (32). Furthermore, ESD can safely be performed under conscious sedation, and short hospital admission is required as opposed to TEM. The reduced morbidity, reduced hospital admission and redundancy of anesthesia associated with ESD are beneficial from both patients' and societal perspective. OBJECTIVE Hypothesis Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and extended endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are both effective treatments for large rectal adenomas with comparable recurrence rates. However, ESD does not require general/spinal anesthesia and may be associated with lower morbidity. Therefore, ESD may improve quality of life and reduce health care costs. Objective The main objective of the proposed randomized study is to compare the effectiveness of TEM and ESD for the removal of large rectal adenomas. Primary Endpoint: incidence of recurrence at 3 months Secondary Endpoints: morbidity, subdivided into major (requiring surgery) and minor (requiring endoscopic or medical intervention) anorectal function. disease specific and general quality of life; number of days not spent in hospital from initial treatment until 12 months STRATEGY Design This will be a multicentre randomized trial comparing TEM and ESD in patients with large rectal adenomas with respect to cost-effectiveness and safety. Randomization Patient data are entered into a computerized database and by means of an unchangeable computer generated number patients will be randomized to undergo TEM or ESD. Blinding Blinding of patients and physicians during treatment is unfeasible, since the two treatment strategies are highly different in nature and in associated care. Study population Patients are eligible for this trial when they meet the following inclusion criteria: Diagnosed with a large non-pedunculated rectal adenoma (sessile or flat) with a largest diameter of ≥2 cm (estimated by an opened resection snare of 20 or 30 mm). The lower and upper borders of the adenoma are located at ≥2 cm and ≤15 cm from the anal verge, respectively. Biopsies of the lesion did not show malignant neoplastic tissue on histopathological evaluation; only lesions with low or high grade dysplasia are suitable for inclusion. During flexible video endoscopy there are no signs of endoscopic suspicion for submucosal invasive cancer (Kudo pit pattern type V; excavated/depressed type morphology; fold convergence; or large smooth nodule \>1 cm in a flat lesion) (33). In case of doubt, patients will undergo EUS as described at (2). In case doubt remains after flexible video endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) of the rectal adenoma should exclude invasion into the submucosal layer and exclude pathological lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes \>1 cm). When pathological lymph nodes are present, fine needle aspiration will be performed to exclude lymph node metastasis (N+ disease). If not performed already, total colonoscopy will be done to detect and remove all synchronous colonic adenomas or cancers first. Cecal intubation must be confirmed by identification of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. The general health condition of the patient permits general anesthesia (ASA- classification I-III). Absence of non-correctable coagulopathy (international normalized ratio \>1,5, or platelet count \<90 × 109/l). Patient age of 18 years or older. Intervention strategies Transanal endoscopic microsurgery: TEM will be performed as described by Buess.(7) Under general anesthesia a specialized TEM rectoscope of 12 or 20 cm in length (Wolf GmbH Knittlingen) or 15 cm in length (Storz GmbH Tuttlingen, Germany) is inserted within the rectum to assure proper visualization of the lesion. The rectoscope is fixed to the operating table by a supporting device, providing the opportunity to reposition the rectoscope during ongoing surgery. The rectal cavity is insufflated with CO2 by a combined endosurgical unit to achieve constant distension for appropriate visualization of the rectal adenoma. The combined endosurgical unit further regulates irrigation and suction, thereby maintaining a constant intra rectal pressure. With the use of a binocular stereoscopic eyepiece for three-dimensional view (Wolf GmbH only) or a forward oblique telescope (Storz GmbH) a magnified view is being created for visualization of the lesion. With various HF monopolar and bipolar instruments, Ultracision harmonic scalpel (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, USA), needle diathermy, tissue handling forceps, needle holder, suction probe, injection needle, clip applicator) the adenoma will be dissected by means of an en-bloc full-thickness rectal wall excision until the perirectal fat. Postoperatively, patients will preserve a urinary catheter that will be removed at the first postoperative day. Patients are admitted to the hospital in accordance with current practice. After 3 months a control flexible endoscopy will be performed by the surgeon who performed the TEM procedure. If presumed residual disease is seen, biopsies will be taken to confirm the presence of neoplasia by histology. Hereafter, the residual adenomatous tissue will be resected endoscopically by either ESD (if \>20 mm) or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (if \<20mm). Any intervention by ESD/EMR at 3 months is part of the TEM treatment strategy. Endoscopic submucosal dissection: Endoscopic submucosal dissection is performed as described by Fujiro (9) At the discretion of the endoscopist, conscious sedation is used with 2.5-10 mg midazolam and/or 25-100 µg of fentanyl. An endoscope is inserted into the rectum and air insufflation via the endoscope will provide proper distension of the rectum. The submucosa underneath the lesion will be injected through an endoscopic injection catheter with a solution of saline 0.9%, 1 ml methylene blue, and 1:10,000 units adrenaline in order to lift the adenoma (no upper volume limit). The lesion will be marked around with a 5 mm disease free margin by APC dots. An endoscopic knife (Insulated Tip Knife, Olympus or Water Jet, Erbe) will be used to resect the lesion through the submucosal plane in an en-bloc fashion. Visible submucosal vessels will be treated by endoscopic clips or electro-coagulation to prevent delayed bleeding. Hereafter, the edges of the mucosal defect and potential remnants within the resection crater will always be treated with APC to increase adenoma clearance. If bleeding during the procedure precludes \>90% clearance of the adenoma, the ESD procedure will be considered as failure. All patients are admitted to the hospital for at least 24-hours observation; in accordance with current practice. After 3 months the treating endoscopist will perform a control endoscopy. If presumed residual disease is seen, biopsies will be taken to confirm the presence of neoplasia by histology. Hereafter, the residual adenomatous tissue will be resected endoscopically by either ESD (if \>20 mm) or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (if \<20mm). Any intervention by ESD/EMR at 3 months is part of the TEM treatment strategy. Intervention failure When for technical reasons ESD procedures turn out not to be performable after randomization or when ESD fails to remove \>90% of the adenoma, the patient will automatically undergo the TEM treatment strategy. Histopathological evaluation Resection specimens after TEM and ESD will be stretched and pinned on a cork plate before immersion into formalin. After standard processing the resection specimen will be transected each cm for evaluation by a gastrointestinal pathologist. The lateral and basal resection margins will be evaluated for absence of neoplasia, when possible. The risk of lymph node metastases is increased in case of malignant neoplasia extending into the submucosal layer, poor tumor differentiation, mucinous cancer, vascular invasion and tumor budding, all of which warrant further radical surgery (34-37). By strict adherence to the inclusion criteria, the risk of invasive cancer is reduced to 1.6-3% (33,38). In case of an unexpected invasive cancer despite adherence to the inclusion criteria, the patient will be excluded after the histopathological evaluation (late exclusion). In case of intramucosal cancer (i.e. not invading through the muscularis mucosae), both TEM and ESD will be regarded as sufficient treatment when the lesion is radically removed. Outcome parameters Primary outcome measure (for non-inferiority): Recurrence of neoplasia, defined as the presence of histologically proven neoplastic tissue in either visible recurrent lesions or in random biopsies, taken at surveillance endoscopies after the intervention strategy has been completed. Any remnant adenoma identified and treated by ESD/EMR/APC at 3 months is considered part of the initial intervention strategy in both arms. Hereafter, patients will undergo surveillance endoscopies at 6 and 12 months by an independent endoscopist who is blinded for the primary treatment. During each surveillance endoscopy recurrence will objectively be defined by the Higaki criteria for recurrence: tumor appearing within a clear resection scar; tumors with convergent folds; and tumors nearby a clear resection scar (within 5 mm).(39) Targeted biopsies will be taken for histological confirmation; in case of an apparently healed normal scar without evidence of recurrence, biopsies will be taken from the basis and 3 from the edges of the scar to detect occult recurrent neoplasia. The following standardized discharge criteria will be applied in all participating hospitals: normal intake of nutrition; normal mobility; absence of fever (\<38°C); and stable hemoglobin level during 1 day (\<1 mmol/L) in case of rectal blood loss. Additional outcome measures: 1. Complications: subdivided into procedural (during treatment) and delayed complications (after ending the procedure); and further subdivided into major (requiring additional surgery) and minor (requiring endoscopic or medical intervention) complications. During admission patients will be monitored for complications. In case of same day discharge from the hospital patients will be called by telephone 1 day after the procedure whether adverse events have happened. Two weeks after the intervention, a research nurse will contact the patient by telephone again and ask for occurred complications. 2. Generic and disease-specific health related quality of life will be measured at baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 and year follow-up by the SF-36 and Wexner score (for incontinence) questionnaires. 3. Measurement of anorectal functional outcome by anal manometry and rectal volumetry (barostat) before and 3 months after treatment. 4. Costs of TEM and ESD from a societal perspective, based on primary data (see economic evaluation section). 5. Patient preferences regarding TEM or ESD will be measured at the end of follow-up by a structured questionnaire to enable a discrete choice experiment addressing the burden of care, burden of complications, prognostic uncertainties, and recurrence rates of both treatments. Sample size calculation Assuming a baseline recurrence rate of 6% for both TEM and ESD (average recurrence based on a systematic review) and considering an upper limit of 10% for ESD to be non-inferior, with a β-error of 0.2 and α-error of 0.05, 60 patients are needed per randomization group. Since ESD is known to be effective in even more than 2 attempts, an upper limit of 10% seems reasonable, whereas higher recurrence rates would lead to many additional procedures which renders this strategy impracticable and probably not cost-effective. Patient recruitment Consecutive eligible patients will be recruited at the outpatient clinic in the participating centers by the involved physician (surgeon/gastroenterologist). All patients fulfilling the above-mentioned criteria will be informed about the study by the physician. After consent is given, central randomization will take place web-based and patients will be treated according to the study protocol. Patients unable or refusing to provide informed consent will be treated according to current clinical guidelines. Data-analysis Since the main outcome of this study is the neoplasia recurrence rate, i.e. proportion of patients with recurrent disease, the Chi-square test will be used to compare the intervention groups (TEM versus ESD). Since the event of recurrence, and not time to recurrence, is the most important indicator for treatment failure, Kaplan Meier methods will not be used. The complication and mortality rates will be compared in the same manner. The number of days not spent in hospital as additional primary outcome measure will be compared by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differences between the intervention groups in continuous outcome measures (e.g. Wexner incontinence scale, quality of life questionnaires, and manometry/volumetry) will be tested by the student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, where appropriate. All analyses will be carried out primarily on an intention-to-treat basis. Time schedule Patients will be recruited for this study from October 2009 until December 2010 in all participating centers. All randomized patients will be followed up for 12 months (until December 2011). The last 3 months (until March 2012) will be used for statistical analysis and reporting of data. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Diagnosed with a large non-pedunculated rectal adenoma (sessile or flat) with a largest diameter of ≥2 cm (estimated by an opened resection snare of 20 or 30 mm). 2. The lower and upper borders of the adenoma are located at ≥2 cm and ≤15 cm from the anal verge, respectively. 3. Biopsies of the lesion did not show malignant neoplastic tissue on histopathological evaluation; only lesions with low or high grade dysplasia are suitable for inclusion. 4. During flexible video endoscopy there are no signs of endoscopic suspicion for submucosal invasive cancer (Kudo pit pattern type V; excavated/depressed type morphology; fold convergence; or large smooth nodule \>1 cm in a flat lesion) (33). In case of doubt, patients will undergo EUS as described at (2). 5.

Lamins A and C form with the B-type lamins the lamina network underlying the nuclear envelope. Lamins are major components that provide structural and mechanical stability for the nucleus ubiquitously. Lamins are also key epigenetic regulator. Mutations in LMNA are involved in different inherited pathologies as Emery-Dreifuss muscular Dystrophy, Limb Girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease, Charcot Marie Tooth Disorder type 2, mandibuloacral dysplasia, Hutchinson Gilford progeria and Dunnigan-type-familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD2).

Inherited lipodystrophy prevalence is reported around 1.3 to 10 cases per million worldwide and FPLD2 is the most frequent of all. Nevertheless, recent reports with systematic screening in all non-obese patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome found higher prevalence of lipodystrophy up to 1/7000 subjects. FPLD2 remain a rare group of disease and only relatively small and heterogeneous cohorts of patients are reported. For this reason it is difficult to fully decipher all aspects of this rare group of diseases. The ""typical"" FPLD2 is associated with missense mutation affecting the arginin residue in position 482 (p.R482Q,p.R482W,p.R482L). Patients harbouring mutation in other spot are considered to have ""atypical"" lipodystrophy. The ""typical"" FPLD2 start around puberty with progressive subcutaneous fat loss in upper limbs, gluteo-femoral adipose tissue and trunk and fat accumulation in the cervicofacial area, neck, upper trunk, labia majora and visceral fat. Resulting from the inability to store fat, patients affected by inherited lipodystrophy develop severe metabolic syndrome and its complications: type 2 diabetes (DT2), dyslipidaemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD).

In 2006 a specific mutation of LMNA has been described in a patient originated from La Réunion living in France mainland. To date this mutation have only been reported in patient native from La Réunion and is called 'Reunionese' mutation and consist in a G insertion after nucleotide 5670 (codon 654) in the prelamin-A-specific exon 11 (g.5670_5671insG) p.T655fsX49 that lead to a longer and non farnelysated prelamin A lacking the C-terminal CSIM motif. As a result, nonfarnelysated mutated prelamin A accumulated in the cells leading to oxidative stress and premature cell senescence. The 'Reunionese' mutation is expressed in 2 forms either homozygous or heterozygous. Homozygous patients present with more severe phenotype and cardiac laminopathy.

The aim of our study is to update the characterization of the patients diagnosed with the 'Reunionese' mutation. The investigators report here the largest cohort of patient with FPLD2 due to one single LMNA mutation either homozygous or heterozygous.","The investigators systematically reviewed the medical records of patients with a diagnosis of genetically confirmed FPLD at Reunion University Hospital (La Réunion, France) from 2006 (beginning of the screening for lipodystrophy) to 2020.

The study will also assess potential effects of Tregs on beta cell function and the autoimmune response.

Subjects will receive Polyclonal Tregs at doses of 3 or 20x10\^6 cells/kg. The dose of Tregs is selected based on a combination of considerations of manufacturing capacity, a predicted efficacious dose, and the available safety data of the Treg product currently in clinical trials. The IL-2 dose will be 1 x10\^6 IU subcutaneously, given daily for 5 consecutive days at the completion of the cell infusion and again after 1 month. This dose is based on recent studies from Klatzmann et al. in T1DM, where the dose was found to be effective in a selective Treg expansion, well tolerated, and without an acute decline in beta cell function (Rosenzwajg et al., 2015).","Inclusion Criteria:

The investigators hypothesize that ex vivo expanded human autologous CD4+CD127lo/-CD25+ polyclonal regulatory T cells (Polyclonal Tregs) plus Interleukin-2 (IL-2) administered to patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) will be safe and biologically active. A Phase I trial with this cellular therapy plus IL-2 will lead the way for Phase II trials that test for efficacy based on preservation of C-peptide, reduced exogenous insulin requirements and improved glycemic control. This is a Phase I safety/dosing study of Polyclonal Tregs + IL-2 in patients with T1DM. The Tregs will be expanded using an established protocol utilizing anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads plus IL-2. The study will involve 2 dosing cohorts of 6-8 T1DM patients each. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of Tregs + IL-2 and survival of Tregs in patients with recent onset T1DM who receive infusions of autologous Tregs + IL-2. The study will also assess potential effects of Tregs on beta cell function and the autoimmune response. Subjects will receive Polyclonal Tregs at doses of 3 or 20x10\^6 cells/kg.

The IL-2 dose will be 1 x10\^6 IU subcutaneously, given daily for 5 consecutive days at the completion of the cell infusion and again after 1 month. This dose is based on recent studies from Klatzmann et al. in T1DM, where the dose was found to be effective in a selective Treg expansion, well tolerated, and without an acute decline in beta cell function (Rosenzwajg et al., 2015).

Its objective is to evaluate the clinical use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) by travelers or their peers during travel, as a decision aid for the management of febrile illness in the tropics.

If the study demonstrates that malaria can be ruled out safely by travelers themselves using a RDT, a combination of self/peer testing with SBET may become an alternative to antimalarial chemoprophylaxis in travel medicine.","Objectives:

To evaluate the clinical use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) by travelers or their peers during travel, as a decision aid for the management of febrile illness.

Design: Prospective cohort study of febrile illness in international travelers

Population: Travelers who are going to destinations in the tropics (South-East Asia (SEA), Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South America (SCA)) for 3 weeks or longer will be invited to participate and, after obtaining informed consent, recruited in the study protocol(s) at the time of planning departure (directly at the ITM or through travel/ humanitarian relief organizations).

Methods: Participants will be offered pre-, per- and post-travel consultation as explained below:

Inclusion through ITM; 1. Pre-travel consultation at a certified travel clinic (""Erkend Centrum voor Medisch Reisadvies en Inentingen"") will systematically be recommended; this consultation will include:

(1) routine travel advice directed at travel destination, (including vaccinations and prescription for anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis according to current recommendations, details of which are published at www.reisgeneeskunde.be and (2) the following research-related activities:

* Briefing sessions on the topic ""Fever in The Tropics"" by an ITM physician (during this session the differences between fever at home and in the tropics will be addressed and the importance of consulting a local doctor will be stressed).

* Training of travelers, peers and travel guides to perform and interpret a malaria RDT (training is a prerequisite for study participation).
* Provision of study materials (study diary/apps, malaria kits, thermometer, ...) and written instructions for use during travel if fever occurs.

  2. During travel
* In case of any illness (associated with fever or not), the traveler will record symptoms in the study diary.
* If fever is documented (axillary temperature ≥ 37.8°C - or in case a thermometer is not immediately available, fever sensation in association with sweats or chills)- blood from a finger prick will be collected for use of the malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT, presenting as a nitrocellulose strip in a plastic cassette).
* In case of a positive RDT result the traveler is advised to start artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) as 'standby emergency treatment' (SBET) for malaria as soon as possible.
* All febrile travelers are advised to seek medical attendance as they would do when not participating in the study.
* To guide interpretation of the RDT test results, precise instructions will be provided (Annex); to allow post-hoc verification, photographs of the RDT test will be taken at the time of reading, to be kept or sent to the ITM study team for advice (see below)quality control and study documentation. Participants will also asked to store the RDT cassette for further analysis upon return.
* The final decision to use standby emergency treatment malaria treatment (SBET) is made by the study participant, in accordance with precise and written instructions.
* The study team (Tropical medicine experts at ITM) will be available for teleconsultation by Email or Telephone, and will provide medical advice (including assistance in RDT reading and interpretation) within 12 hours. Note: contacting the ITM study team is an option, but should not cause delay in treating suspected malaria.
* Study participants will collect all relevant data related to the (outcome of the) illness episode (duration of symptoms, consultation of a health practitioner, admission/duration of stay in a hospital, treatment received and timing, repatriation)

  3. Post-travel consultation will be scheduled for all study participants who experience(d) any illness (febrile or not) within a week after travel- sooner if the medical condition requires so- and for those who have no complaints but do seek post-travel health evaluation.
* A structured clinical evaluation will be performed by an expert in travel medicine and will be recorded in the database. Laboratory evaluation will include hematological, biochemical and microbiological/parasitological analysis
* Used RDTs will be collected for confirmation of the test result by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).

  * Data analysis : All data (demographic, geographic, clinical, laboratory and final diagnosis) will be recorded in an encoded database. Descriptive and inferential statistics as appropriate, STATA 14.
  * Sample size: n= 350 fever cases; at an incidence of fever of 8% a cohort of 4400 (healthy) travelers will be recruited over 30 months (Feb 2016 - Aug 2018).
  * Endpoints:
* To determine the post-test probability for malaria after a negative RDT result (i.e. excluding power of the RDT) as well as other measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value) in travelers with febrile illness, when performed by travelers (or their peers)- compared with PCR detection of Plasmodium spp. on the RDT after return
* Qualitative description of ease of self-/peer- use of malaria RDT
* Incidence rates for malaria (by use of RDT and post-travel PCR on RDT)
* Clinical course and outcomes of (self-)management of febrile illness during travel.

Expected results and relevance:

If the study demonstrates that malaria can be ruled out safely by travelers themselves using a RDT, a combination of self/peer testing with SBET may become an alternative to antimalarial chemoprophylaxis in travel medicine.","Inclusion Criteria:

However, the vast majority of the scientific evidence in support of this view is based on persons with MS who have minimal mobility impairment. This is partially due to the lack of accessible exercise equipment and facilities available to persons with severe mobility limitations.

One option available to persons with severe mobility limitations is body weight supported treadmill training. Indeed, this rehabilitation approach has been utilized with some success in various clinical populations, such as stroke and spinal cord injury, and is believed to target neuroplasticity. Specific to persons with MS, body weight supported treadmill training has shown great promise in improving quality of life, symptoms and functional mobility in two small (n=4 and n=6) pilot investigations. However, previous research has been hampered by methodological limitations including small sample size, lack of a control group and limited training sessions. Consequently, no firm conclusion regarding the benefit of body weighted supported treadmill training in persons with MS can be drawn. The proposed project seeks to determine if twenty-weeks of body weight supported treadmill training leads to improvements in physiological function, mobility and quality of life in persons with MS with severe mobility limitations. The outcomes of this project have the potential to lead to new rehabilitation approaches capable of improving function and quality of life in persons with advanced MS.","One option available to persons with severe mobility limitations is body weight supported treadmill training.

Physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs that include aerobic and progressive resistance exercises in the treatment of functional disorders by controlling the symptoms of the disease increase the quality of life by improving aerobic capacity, but sustainability can be difficult due to difficulties in accessing the clinic. Following exercise programs with telerehabilitation (TR) methods improves cognitive function, mobility, balance, participation, and quality of life by increasing physical activity and reducing fatigue. However, the details of the frequency, duration, and the way the program is delivered are not known, and although the exercise methods applied with TR methods are found to be as effective as the practices performed in the clinic, the remote limited patient-therapist relationship creates potential problems for patients to follow up on the digital platform. The hybrid TR model, in which a certain part of the exercise program is carried out face-to-face, can provide a solution to these problems by increasing patient-therapist communication. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study examining the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program applied with the hybrid TR model for individuals with MS.

NYU Langone Health,OTHER,NCT02608879,Oral Care Protocol for the Management of Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy-Induced Oral Mucositis,Oral Care Protocol for the Management of Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy-Induced Oral Mucositis,"The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a novel oral care protocol on the severity and pain of oral mucositis in patients receiving radiation and/or chemotherapy for head and neck cancers. The secondary objectives are to characterize the microbiome associated with oral mucositis, measure salivary proinflammatory cytokines, and evaluate other clinical indicators of the intervention. Participants will be enrolled prior to beginning radiation and/or chemotherapy, and will be randomized to receive either the oral health protocol or standard of care oral hygiene.","Oral mucositis (OM) is one of the most debilitating adverse effects in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy or radiation (RT). Currently, there are no effective therapies or prevention for mucositis, while several clinical studies have suggested that professional oral care could effectively reduce the severity of Radiation Therapy or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Palliative treatment, rather than preventive or curative measures, remains the standard of care. Evidence-based guidelines do not provide consistent recommendations for the prevention, treatment and management of oral mucositis.

The investigators hypothesize that a monitored regimen of professional oral hygiene prevents harmful ecological shifts in the oral cavity, improve oral health and reduce the duration and severity of Oral Mucositis in cancer patients, consequently improving their overall quality of life during treatment. Moreover, the investigators hypothesize that the weekly oral hygiene regimen performed by an oral health professional is more effective in treating and preventing mucositis than current standard-of-care treatments.

The principal investigator of this project has developed a novel oral care regimen protocol for the treatment of oral mucositis. The ""Oral Mucosa Deterging and Periodontal Debridement"" (OMDP) protocol consists of a regimen of frequent professional oral prophylaxis including tooth cleaning, tooth polishing and flossing, and the debridement of the periodontium and deterging of the oral mucosa. This is an intervention that is implemented prior to and maintained throughout the entire cycle of the radiation or chemoradiation. Co-adjuvant treatments such as intense fluoride treatments, oral hygiene instructions and palliative mouth-rinses are also part of the protocol. The hypothesis is that repeated professional prophylaxis of the oral cavity would protect the healthy oral tissue against infection and inflammation often associated with severe cases of mucositis, and consequently reduces mucositis incidence and duration.

Participants in this study would attend approximately 9 study visits over the course of 16-18 weeks, depending on their specific cancer treatment plan. Study participants will be randomized to receive either the oral health protocol, which they will receive on a weekly basis, or standard of care oral hygiene instructions and tooth brushing, preformed on a bi-weekly basis.","Inclusion Criteria:

1. Male and female patient aged 18 years or older;
2. Patients must sign an informed consent before data collection, screening, or initiation of study procedures;
3. Patients who are scheduled to undergo radiation or chemoradiation treatment for head/neck cancer;
4. Patients who have a minimum of 6 natural teeth at the time of enrollment.

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating at the baseline/screening visit;
2. Patient participating in another biomedical/oral health research study that would interfere with participating in this study;
3. Patient deprived of freedom, under supervision or guardianship;

The secondary objectives are to characterize the microbiome associated with oral mucositis, measure salivary proinflammatory cytokines, and evaluate other clinical indicators of the intervention. Participants will be enrolled prior to beginning radiation and/or chemotherapy, and will be randomized to receive either the oral health protocol or standard of care oral hygiene. Oral mucositis (OM) is one of the most debilitating adverse effects in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy or radiation (RT). Currently, there are no effective therapies or prevention for mucositis, while several clinical studies have suggested that professional oral care could effectively reduce the severity of Radiation Therapy or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Palliative treatment, rather than preventive or curative measures, remains the standard of care. Evidence-based guidelines do not provide consistent recommendations for the prevention, treatment and management of oral mucositis. The investigators hypothesize that a monitored regimen of professional oral hygiene prevents harmful ecological shifts in the oral cavity, improve oral health and reduce the duration and severity of Oral Mucositis in cancer patients, consequently improving their overall quality of life during treatment. Moreover, the investigators hypothesize that the weekly oral hygiene regimen performed by an oral health professional is more effective in treating and preventing mucositis than current standard-of-care treatments. The principal investigator of this project has developed a novel oral care regimen protocol for the treatment of oral mucositis. The ""Oral Mucosa Deterging and Periodontal Debridement"" (OMDP) protocol consists of a regimen of frequent professional oral prophylaxis including tooth cleaning, tooth polishing and flossing, and the debridement of the periodontium and deterging of the oral mucosa. This is an intervention that is implemented prior to and maintained throughout the entire cycle of the radiation or chemoradiation. Co-adjuvant treatments such as intense fluoride treatments, oral hygiene instructions and palliative mouth-rinses are also part of the protocol. The hypothesis is that repeated professional prophylaxis of the oral cavity would protect the healthy oral tissue against infection and inflammation often associated with severe cases of mucositis, and consequently reduces mucositis incidence and duration. Participants in this study would attend approximately 9 study visits over the course of 16-18 weeks, depending on their specific cancer treatment plan. Study participants will be randomized to receive either the oral health protocol, which they will receive on a weekly basis, or standard of care oral hygiene instructions and tooth brushing, preformed on a bi-weekly basis. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Male and female patient aged 18 years or older; 2. Patients must sign an informed consent before data collection, screening, or initiation of study procedures; 3.

In addition to studying safety, Phase II clinical trials test if the investigational drug is effective and whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. ""Investigational"" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved CRLX101 for your type of cancer.

Camptothecin is a chemical extracted from plants that is the basis for the standard FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs irinotecan and topotecan. Camptothecin works by interfering with the way cells divide and multiply. The investigational drug CRLX101 is a formulation of camptothecin and a large molecule (nanoparticle)that appears to allow more of the camptothecin to get into tumors and stay in tumors. The persistence of the CRLX101 in the tumor may increase the probability that the tumor cells will be damaged.

CRLX101 has been well tolerated in the laboratory and in participants with different kinds of cancer.

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a VEGF inhibitor which has activity in many kinds of cancer. Bevacizumab has been successfully combined with many chemotherapy partners.

It has been hypothesized that the combination of bevacizumab with CRLX101 might have unique clinical activity in combination in the treatment of this disease due to the simultaneous inhibition of distinct steps along the HIF → (CAIX) → VEGF → VEGFR2 pathway. Specifically, it is hypothesized that CRLX101-mediated inhibition of HIF-1α carries with it the potential to interrupt hypoxia and HIF-1α-associated resistance to VEGFR inhibitors.

The therapy offered to CRPS-I patients is diverse and can involve invasive and non-invasive interventions. Current (inter)national guidelines recommend physiotherapy as the best non-invasive treatment for rehabilitation. Recently, cognitive and behavioural Graded Exposure in Vivo (GEXP) therapy aimed at reducing pain-related fear was found to be effective (De Jong et al. 2005), and more effective than standard physical therapy (ReMOVE study, articles in preparation). By reducing pain-related fear EXP might reconcile motor output and sensory feedback.

Another type of pain is lower back pain (LBP), which affects 70% to 85% of general population, but usually heals within 12 weeks in 90% of patients. The rest of the patients suffer from intractable, chronic LBP despite no evident organic abnormality. Research shows that also in these patients cognitive and behavioural aspects of pain are important and related to physical performance and self-reported disability (Vlaeyen et al., 2000). Several studies have demonstrated the success of GEXP in this patient group: GEXP resulted in improvements in pain-related fear, catastrophizing, performance of daily relevant activities, and in pain intensity (Leeuw et al., 2008).

This study aims to investigate the effect of GEXP on brain regions involved in the processing of harmless tactile stimuli in CRPS-I and CLBP patients, as well as its effect on tactile discrimination thresholds. We hypothesize that GEXP will induce 1) an improvement of tactile discrimination thresholds, 2) a functional reorganization of primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (in regions related to the affected limb in CRPS-I; and to the back in LBP), 3) changes in activation of emotional brain circuits during non-noxious stimulation, 4) changes in resting state connectivity between emotional and sensory brain areas, 5) changes in measures reflecting white matter integrity. No systematic changes are expected in the healthy controls.

Patients diagnosed with CRPS-I and CLBP will participate in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) experiment. In this observational study, we examine the effects of GEXP treatment that all patients receive as part of usual care. Anatomical as well as diffusion-weighted and T2\*-weighted (Blood oxygenation level dependent) MR images will be acquired. The study has a 3x4 split plot design with group (CRPS-I patients and CLBP receiving GEXP treatment / healthy controls) as between-subjects variable and time (pre-, during, post-treatment and follow-up) as within-subject variable.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Westat,OTHER,NCT04531579,Valproic Acid (VPA) for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in Trauma Patients,Evaluation of Valproic Acid (VPA) as Adjunctive Therapy for Trauma Patients With Moderate to Severe Hemorrhage at Risk of Ischemia Reperfusion (I/R) Injury,"The purpose of this study is to find out if a drug called valproic acid (VPA) will protect organs (such as the kidneys) from damage when a person is injured and loses a large amount of blood. The organs may not get enough blood or oxygen when a patient loses a lot of blood. After the patient receives fluids such as blood, plasma, or saline and the bleeding is stopped, blood and oxygen return to the organs. This process called ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is known to cause injury to organs such as the kidneys and heart. VPA is an approved drug for treating conditions like seizures and migraines for many years. However, it is not approved for use at the higher dose that will be used in this study or for protecting organs from I/R injury. This study will enroll trauma patients and randomly assign them to receive either VPA diluted in salt water or salt water without VPA (placebo) and then follow the patients and compare their organ function and overall outcome. This study is masked meaning that the patients, doctors, and nurses will not know which patient received which treatment. The study treatment will be given in addition to the care that trauma patients normally receive to treat their injuries. The researchers doing this study believe that VPA will lessen organ injury caused by I/R, meaning that patients who receive VPA will experience less kidney injury when compared to patients who receive the placebo.","I/R injury is a critical condition that causes cell damage and organ dysfunction and contributes to morbidity and mortality in a wide range of pathologies. Ischemia is defined as hypoperfusion of tissues, which can occur in conditions such as hemorrhage, sepsis, organ transplantation, and acute coronary syndrome. An imbalance in metabolic supply and demand within the ischemic organ results in tissue hypoxia and microvascular dysfunction. Among trauma patients who have suffered significant blood loss and prolonged hypotension requiring multiple vasopressors, the kidney frequently shows injury due to significant I/R. The rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) in trauma patients is reported to be between 25-30%.

VPA is an anticonvulsant drug that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1978. VPA was developed for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for the treatment of seizure disorders, mania associated with bipolar disorder, and migraine. Both oral and intravenous (IV) formulations are available. Doses up to 60 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day for up to 14 days have been demonstrated to be safe and effective. More recently, a study has shown that a single dose of intravenous VPA at up to 140 mg/kg is safe in healthy volunteers. VPA has been recognized as an histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) shown to reduce the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in septic mice, thereby protecting against renal injury. The molecular mechanisms conferring anticonvulsant properties associated with VPA have not been clearly elucidated to date, but likely include increasing levels of γ-aminobutyric acid in the central nervous system (CNS), reduction in N-Methyl-D-Aspartate-mediated excitation, and blockade of voltage gated sodium and L-type calcium channels. More recently, VPA has shown HDACI potential, specifically targeting class I (subclasses Ia and Ib) and class II (subclass IIa) HDAC proteins. Given that VPA modulates multiple pathways involved in AKI, it theoretically could prevent kidney dysfunction and inflammation that is induced by I/R injury.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of VPA on reducing I/R injury related to organ damage in the kidneys in trauma patients with moderate-to-severe hemorrhage. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of VPA on reducing AKI compared with placebo in trauma patients with expected moderated-to-severe hemorrhage at risk for I/R injury. The two secondary objectives are: 1) To assess the post-infusion pharmacokinetics (PK) of VPA in trauma patients with moderate-to-severe hemorrhage at risk of I/R injury, and 2) To evaluate the safety of VPA administered as IV infusion in trauma patients with moderate-to-severe hemorrhage at risk of I/R injury.

This is a phase 2, single-dose, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of 140 mg/kg of VPA plus standard of care (SOC) or the placebo plus SOC, administered via IV infusion within 3 hours (ideally 1 hour) after admittance to the emergency department (ED). Clinical evaluations such as physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory results will be collected. AKI will be used to assess VPA efficacy. Myocardial injury and laboratory measurements (hematology, chemistry, coagulation profile, and urinalysis) will be used to monitor subject safety. Outcome measures including in-hospital mortality, length of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or stepdown unit (SDU) stay, length of hospital stay, number of alive and ventilator free days (aVFD), and incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) will also be collected. Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis. The PK analysis will correlate study drug exposures with safety profiles. Specimens (plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and urine) will be stored for future undetermined study-related analyses, including pharmacodynamics (PD) and VPA responsiveness studies. These studies may correlate PK profiles to molecular changes related to beneficial properties of VPA.

Male and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding female hemorrhaging trauma patients between 18 and 80 years old will be recruited for the study. Trauma patients will be those whose arrival to the ED results in trauma team activation. Only patients who can provide consent or for whom a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) can provide consent, will be enrolled. Approximately 50 subjects will be recruited from across two major medical centers for participation in this study.

Based on the available safety profile data from multi-dose clinical trials of VPA, the product safety information sheet, as well as the VPA Phase 1 study which evaluated the safety of single ascending doses of VPA, it has been determined that a dose of 140 mg/kg is safe and well-tolerated with minimal adverse reactions. However, given that patients studied at the 140 mg/kg dose in the phase 1 study were relatively healthy compared to the proposed patient population in this study and unanticipated Adverse Events (AEs) may occur, the study team will monitor all study subjects closely for AEs throughout the study. All AEs will be evaluated for duration, seriousness, severity, and relationship to the study drug, and reported accordingly.

This study will be monitored according to the data and safety monitoring plan which will outline the different levels of monitoring and the responsible parties. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review and monitor all safety information and compliance data as well as the overall study progress on a regular basis. A Medical Monitor (MM) with relevant clinical and research expertise will oversee the clinical study and provide ongoing medical monitoring. The clinical site Principal Investigators (PIs) will be responsible for ensuring that all AEs that occur in subjects during the AE reporting period are managed and reported in accordance with the protocol, Sponsor requirements, and any applicable regulations and institutional policies. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor implementation and progress of the study and review the accumulating endpoint and safety data by treatment arm to detect evidence of early significant benefit or harm for subjects while the study is in progress.

As the main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of VPA in the study population and to investigate efficacy signal, this is a proof-of-concept (PoC) study. Because it is a PoC study rather than a confirmatory one, it has been assumed that a total sample size of 50 subjects (25 in each treatment arm) will be sufficient to provide adequate clinical evidence of safety and potential efficacy, and to support decision-making on whether a larger pivotal confirmatory Phase 3 study would be justified.

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) that details the analytical principles and statistical techniques to be employed in order to address the primary and secondary objectives will be developed. Demographic and relevant baseline characteristics will be presented and summarized descriptively by treatment for the randomized, modified intent-to-treat (mITT), and per-protocol (PP) populations. The primary endpoint of KDIGO stages will be measured in ordinal scale as 0, 1, 2, or 3, where 0 indicates normal renal function and the progressively higher values indicate worsening renal function. The ordinal scale measurements will be analyzed using the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model. The KDIGO stages will be the dependent variable and drug treatment will be used as the independent variable. The common odds ratio across the KDIGO stages and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated. Binary endpoints (e.g., incidence of AKI) will be analyzed by Fisher's exact test or logistic regression with treatment as an independent variable. The odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated. Continuous outcomes will be analyzed by missed effects models with treatment and baseline value of the outcome (if applicable) as independent variables. Un-ordered categorical variables with more than two levels of outcome will be analyzed by a chi-square test. Ordered categorical variables with more than two levels of outcome will be analyzed in the same way as for the primary endpoint. Safety endpoints will be analyzed and summarized descriptively. Categorical variables will be summarized by count and percentage. Odds ratios and relative risks may be calculated to compare study drug with placebo in incidence of certain safety events. Continuous variables will be summarized by mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum. Shift tables may be used to describe changes in certain laboratory values. The plan for the PK analysis is two-fold. First, a standard noncompartmental analysis will be performed to obtain descriptors of VPA exposure to explore potential relationships to the primary outcome), secondary outcomes, or any observed adverse effects. A population PK analysis will be performed to examine and, perhaps, explain the anticipated differing PK of VPA in the trial. Specifically, low protein binding of VPA and massive blood loss are expected to affect the elimination clearance and, perhaps, the volume of distribution of VPA. Characterizing the degree to which the PK are perturbed as well as the parameter variability in this population will be important for analyzing the relationship of VPA exposure to primary and secondary outcomes and determining the effects, if any, of factors related to disease or perioperative conditions to the PK of VPA.

No interim analyses will be performed for this study. This study does not have a formal stopping rule based on statistical testing. See Section 3.9 for more information on stopping rules. Missing data can occur in clinical studies, and they may have an impact on the results of statistical analyses. Every effort will be made to ensure that the amount of missing data is kept at a minimum.","Inclusion Criteria:

Characterizing the degree to which the PK are perturbed as well as the parameter variability in this population will be important for analyzing the relationship of VPA exposure to primary and secondary outcomes and determining the effects, if any, of factors related to disease or perioperative conditions to the PK of VPA. No interim analyses will be performed for this study. This study does not have a formal stopping rule based on statistical testing. See Section 3.9 for more information on stopping rules. Missing data can occur in clinical studies, and they may have an impact on the results of statistical analyses. Every effort will be made to ensure that the amount of missing data is kept at a minimum.

Effective interventions using a multilevel, biopsychosocial approach are needed to decrease the unequal burden of pain. The proposed pilot study will test group-based integrative models of pain management in primary care safety net clinics to improve pain care for racially and ethnically diverse low-income patients.","Background: The proposed pilot study seeks to address chronic pain disparities in racially diverse, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals by optimizing multimodal pain management provided in primary care safety net clinics. Multilevel barriers exist in primary care settings where socioeconomically disadvantaged patients are most often treated. Lack of access to multimodal and nonpharmacologic care at the organizational level alongside provider bias and other forms of discrimination at the interpersonal level contribute to unequal assessment, treatment, and quality of pain care. Stigmatization cross-cuts all levels and is closely linked with social isolation common among individuals with chronic pain. Group-based models are a promising multilevel approach to increase access to non-pharmacologic therapies, address time constraints that contribute to disparities in pain care, improve patient-clinician communication, and provide social support among safety net patients with chronic pain.

Methods: This pilot study uses mixed methods and a pragmatic 2x2 randomized factorial trial to test two group-based models: integrative group medical visits (IGMV) and group acupuncture. Study interventions include 12 weekly sessions based on existing protocols tested in primary care safety net settings. IGMV includes pain education, social and behavioral support, and mind-body approaches (meditation, yoga). Group acupuncture uses responsive manualization, allowing for a standardized yet individualized treatment. During this pilot study, a panel of national experts and patient stakeholders will refine and optimize the structure, process, and content of IGMV aimed at reducing social isolation and intersectional stigma as part of pain management. Interventions will be piloted in 40 English or Spanish speaking patients with chronic pain at two primary care safety net clinics. Study procedures will be tested and adapted for a larger scale trial. The larger study will test the hypotheses that compared with usual care, each study intervention improves pain interference and social isolation (primary outcomes), and that the two combined have synergistic effects mediated by increased social support and decreased impact of intersectional stigma among safety net patients with chronic pain.

Significance: Multilevel approaches are needed to advance health equity in pain management. The proposed study will contribute to knowledge of group-based integrative pain management co-located in primary care to address disparities in pain care for socioeconomically vulnerable populations.

However, inadequate effects, and possible side effects of these treatments are still problems to these patients. Therefore, to find an effective non-medical and non-surgical treatment will be of great help in treating patients with allergic rhinitis.

Infrared-C (far-infrared) ray irradiation is able to promote normal operation of autonomic nervous system, to improve blood circulation and thereby assumed to relieve discomfort symptoms of patients with vascular, specific or non-specific allergic rhinitis. Consequently, infrared-C ray irradiation is expected to be effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

The investigators aimed to probe the adjunct effects of infrared-C ray irradiation in terms of infrared-C hot compress in improving allergy symptoms like sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, nose and conjunctiva itching during a medical treatment for patients with allergic rhinitis. Moreover, the impact of infrared-C irradiation on health and life quality enhancement will also be studied.","This is a quasi-experimental design.

Beersheva Mental Health Center,OTHER_GOV,NCT00140179,Valnoctamide in Mania,Valnoctamide as a Valproate Substitute With Low Teratogenic Potential: Double-Blind Controlled Clinical Trial,"Valproic acid is a leading mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Its well-known teratogenicity limits its use in young women of childbearing age. According to toxicologic studies the teratogenicity of valproate stems from its free carboxylic group. Valnoctamide is an isomer and an analog of valpromide. Unlike valpromide, valnoctamide does not undergo a biotransformation to the corresponding free acid. It is also likely or at least possible that valnoctamide is anti-bipolar. In mice valnoctamide has been shown to be distinctly less teratogenic than valproate. An injection at day 8 of gestation produced only 1% exencephaly (as compared to 0-1% in control mice and 53% in valproate treated mice).

The investigators are performing a double-blind controlled trial of valnoctamide as an anti-bipolar drug. If shown to be anti-bipolar, valnoctamide could be an important valproate substitute for young women with bipolar disorder who are at risk of pregnancy. Patients newly admitted to the Beersheva Mental Health Center may participate if they meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for mania or schizoaffective disorder, manic type. Patients admitted to the study are treated with risperidone at doses of the physicians' discretion beginning with 2 mg daily on days 1 and 2. Valnoctamide or placebo is begun at doses of 600 mg per day (200 mg three times daily) and increased to 1200 mg (400 mg three times daily) after four days.

Weekly ratings by a psychiatrist blind to the study drug are conducted using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Weekly blood is drawn for drug levels of valnoctamide to be measured by gas chromatography. Each patient receives valnoctamide or placebo for 5 weeks.

Low teratogenic mood stabilizers are a high priority for current research.","Valproic acid is a leading mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Its well-known teratogenicity limits its use in young women of childbearing age (1-3). The alternative mood stabilizers such as lithium and carbamazepine also have teratogenic potential so the treatment of bipolar disorder in young women is problematic. The difficulties are particularly acute in those young women patients who respond well to anti-bipolar therapy and maintain or begin normal interpersonal and marital relations and desire to have children.

One approach to this problem has been the search for valproic acid derivatives with less teratogenic potential (4). According to toxicologic studies the teratogenicity of valproate stems from its free carboxylic group (2, 3). Valpromide is an amide derivative of valproate without the suspect free carboxylic group. It was synthesized and marketed and has anticonvulsant efficacy, at least as good as valproic acid (1). There are some reports of its efficacy in bipolar disorder as well (5). In some animal species, only a small amount of valpromide is metabolized to valproic acid. However, in humans valpromide is metabolized to a large degree to valproic acid and so it does not solve the problem of teratogenicity (1, 6).

Valnoctamide is an isomer and an analog of valpromide. Unlike valpromide, valnoctamide does not undergo biotransformation to the corresponding free acid (6-9). In animal studies it is at least as anticonvulsant as valproate and valpromide (1, 6, 10). It has been marketed as an anxiolytic and sedative in several European countries (as Nirvanil) including Italy, Holland and Switzerland but has not actively been promoted as an anticonvulsant. It was marketed in the USA as Axiquel by McNeil in the 1970's. Unfortunately, despite considerable efforts we have not been able to obtain pharmacovigilance data from this period. Given its equivalence to valproate and valpromide as an anticonvulsant in animal models of epilepsy (1, 6, 10), it is reasonable to assume that valnoctamide is also anticonvulsant in humans. It is also likely or at least possible that valnoctamide is anti-bipolar. In mice valnoctamide has been shown to be distinctly less teratogenic than valproate (11). Injection at day 8 of gestation produced only 1percent exencephaly (as compared to 0-1percent in control mice and 53 percent in valproate treated mice). Embryolethality rates showed similar results: 52 percent with valproate vs. 5percent in the controls and 2 percent with valnoctamide.

Valnoctamide's patent is expired (12) and it is not the property of any major pharmaceutical company. Pharmaceutical company support cannot be obtained for our trial; therefore it is investigator initiated.

Valnoctamide will be synthesized for our study by Banyan Chemical in India (which has been inspected by the FDA) by GLP (good laboratory practice) in a manner acceptable for human use by the Israel Ministry of Health (and in principle for an IND by the FDA). Banyan manufactures at the same site generic compounds, atenolol for instance, sold in the USA and distributed by international companies, Novartis for instance.

Study Design:

The study has been submitted to our Helsinki Committee and only patients who give informed written consent will be accepted. Patients newly admitted to the Beersheva Mental Health Center may participate if they meet DSM-IV criteria for mania or schizoaffective disorder, manic type. Minimal Young Mania Scale = 20. Only patients admitted to the hospital within the previous 72 hours will be eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria will be as in previous studies of mania with this design by our group (15-17) and will include drug abuse, active physical illness, and of course pregnancy.

Patients admitted to the study will be treated with risperidone at doses of physicians' discretion beginning with 2 mg daily on days 1 and 2. On days 3 and 4 the risperidone dose could be increased to a maximum of 4 mg daily or decreased to 1mg daily. On days 5 to study end the dose could be increased to a maximum of 6 mg daily or decreased to a minimum of 1mg (see ref #18). Dose of risperidone will be a secondary outcome measure (see reference #15 \& #16). No washout from previous medication is required but patients who received depot neuroleptics within the past 2 weeks or more than 300 mg of chlorpromazine equivalents in the past three days will be excluded. Trihexyphenidyl (up to 4 mg daily) will be available as necessary for extrapyramidal symptoms and benzodiazepines for sleep. Valnoctamide or placebo will be begun at doses of 600 mg per day (200 mg three times daily) and increased to 1200 mg (400 mg three times daily) after four days. This dose is based on relative anticonvulsant effects of valproate and valnoctamide in animal studies (1, 6, 10).

Patients will receive valnoctamide or identical capsules of placebo as assigned by the control psychiatrist according to random order; manic and schizoaffective manic patients will be randomized separately. Weekly ratings by a psychiatrist blind to the study drug will be conducted using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMS), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Primary outcome measure will be BPRS. Weekly blood will be drawn for drug levels of valnoctamide to be measured by gas chromatography (19). Each patient will receive valnoctamide or placebo for 5 weeks.

Power Analysis:

We have demonstrated significant effects as add-on in mania in this design with lithium (15), carbamazepine (16), and phenytoin (17). Each study had an N of about 40 patients, recruited over 18 months in each study. In each study as in the present proposal, a mood stabilizer or potential mood stabilizer was added to haloperidol at doses of physician's discretion for five weeks.

Lithium adds clinically and statistically significant benefit to haloperidol treatment of mania (15) as does carbamazepine (16) and phenytoin (17). Such an ""add-on"" design is consistent with clinical practice and makes sense since dopamine blockers and mood stabilizers probably work by different mechanisms in mania. Valproate is typically used clinically in acute mania as an add-on to neuroleptics as well. Three positive studies published in excellent journals (15-17) from our group using this design are probably better than formal power analysis, which depends on a range of assumptions that are collapsible into the experience of our three studies. Because the prior probability of an effect of valnoctamide is lower than that of the above well-known compounds, we suggest recruitment of 80 patients over 36 months to adequately power this study rather than the 40 patients in each of our previous studies. Since valnoctamide is no longer patented, orphan drug procedures or a use patent of the type granted to Abbott for divalproex sodium will be necessary to make this drug available for bipolar patients at risk for pregnancy in the future. An adequately powered study is therefore important at this stage.

The investigators are performing a double-blind controlled trial of valnoctamide as an anti-bipolar drug. If shown to be anti-bipolar, valnoctamide could be an important valproate substitute for young women with bipolar disorder who are at risk of pregnancy. Patients newly admitted to the Beersheva Mental Health Center may participate if they meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for mania or schizoaffective disorder, manic type.

Low teratogenic mood stabilizers are a high priority for current research. Valproic acid is a leading mood stabilizer for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Its well-known teratogenicity limits its use in young women of childbearing age (1-3). The alternative mood stabilizers such as lithium and carbamazepine also have teratogenic potential so the treatment of bipolar disorder in young women is problematic. The difficulties are particularly acute in those young women patients who respond well to anti-bipolar therapy and maintain or begin normal interpersonal and marital relations and desire to have children. One approach to this problem has been the search for valproic acid derivatives with less teratogenic potential (4). According to toxicologic studies the teratogenicity of valproate stems from its free carboxylic group (2, 3). Valpromide is an amide derivative of valproate without the suspect free carboxylic group. It was synthesized and marketed and has anticonvulsant efficacy, at least as good as valproic acid (1). There are some reports of its efficacy in bipolar disorder as well (5). In some animal species, only a small amount of valpromide is metabolized to valproic acid. However, in humans valpromide is metabolized to a large degree to valproic acid and so it does not solve the problem of teratogenicity (1, 6). Valnoctamide is an isomer and an analog of valpromide.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Evaluation of the effectiveness of the LUMINA lens in patients after lens replacement due to cataracts
* Evaluation of the accommodative power of the LUMINA lens. Participants will have cataract surgery and the IOL LUMINA will be implanted in the sulcus.","This is an observational, prospective, longitudinal, and consecutive study involving patients with clinical cataract eligible for cataract surgery who opt for the implantation of the Lumina (Akkolens, Clinical BV, The Netherlands) accommodative lens. The study was conducted at the Cornea, Cataract, and Refractive Surgery Unit in Vissum Alicante, Miranza Group, Spain. The study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 version )and was approved by the Comite Etico de Investigacion Clinica Vissum Alicante.

The study group included 50 eyes of 25 patients, aged 40 to 81 years (mean 62.27 ± 10.81 years), with clinical cataract who were implanted with the Lumina accommodative IOL. The inclusion criteria of this study were as follows: patients with visual significant cataract with an expected positive effect of the surgery on the visual outcome. The patient had to be ≥ 40 years of age and with a calculated IOL power within the available diopter range. The exclusion criteria were comorbidities causing postoperative visual impairment such as degenerative macular pathology, glaucoma with optic disk damage and visual field loss, retinal dystrophies previous ocular surgeries such as vitrectomy , corneal graft surgery, lens subluxation or significant eye trauma that may induce lens instability, congenital ocular anomalies, endothelial cell count \< 1200 cells/mm2 and previous known reading disabilities such as dyslexia. Only patients with less than 2 diopters (D) of corneal astigmatism were included in the study with no significant corneal irregularities (less than 0.5 microns of anterior corneal surface HOA) as measured by corneal topography (CSO, Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Firenze, Italy). All patients were adequately informed and signed a consent form.

Preoperatively, all patients had a full ophthalmologic examination including the evaluation of the refractive status, keratometry, the distance and near visual acuities, slit lamp examination, applanation tonometry, and funduscopy. Distance and near visual acuity were measured with the ETDRS and the Radner reading chart (logarithm of reading acuity determination, logRAD), respectively. Other examinations included corneal topography Sirius/MS-39 (CSO, Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Firenze, Italy), anterior segment optical coherence tomography MS-39 (CSO, Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Firenze, Italy) or Casia2 (Tomey, Japan), posterior segment optical coherence tomography Cirrus OCT (Zeiss, Germany) and biometry IOL master 700 (Zeiss, Germany). The fixed optical power of the lens (i.e., the power required for an emmetropic eye) was calculated from optical biometry (IOL Master; Zeiss) by using proprietary Cþþ software integrated with Zemax ray-tracing software (Zemax, USA). The target refraction was plano in all cases that were included.

The same surgeon (JLA) performed all surgeries. All patients received retrobulbar anesthesia and mild sedation with midazolam. Adequate dilatation was obtained with intracameral mydriatics. The main corneal incision of 2.8 mm was placed temporally at the 180° meridian position in all eyes. A standard technique of phacoemulsification was performed followed by implantation of the Lumina in the sulcus plane of the eye by using a standard disposable injector system with an adapted, proprietary, AkkoLens butterfly cartridge. Postoperative topical therapy included a combination of topical antibiotics (ofloxacin 0.3%) and a steroid agent (dexamethasone 0.1%, Maxidex; Alcon, Spain).

The patients were evaluated during the follow up at five intervals: 1 day, 1 month, 3 months 6 months and a minimum of 12 months after surgery. In addition to the measurements listed in the preoperative protocol, the postoperative protocol included additional assessments of contrast sensitivity function in mesopic conditions (CSV 1000, VectorVision Ocular Health, Greenville, Ohio, USA) and the defocus curves. Monocular defocus curves were obtained with best distance refractive correction under low ambient light to keep an open pupil to minimize the undesirable effect of extended depth of focus owing to a small pupil, which can mask true accommodation. Negative and positive spherical lenses were added in 0.50 D steps, producing a stimulus for the eye to accommodate in the range from -5.00 to +2.00 D. The means of the measured visual acuities are summarized in mean defocus curves in which the measurements at 0.00 D and-2.50 D correspond to corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and corrected distance near visual acuity (CDNVA), respectively, and intermediate visual acuity corresponds to the measurement at -1.50 D. Depth of focus was evaluated from defocus curves at the levels of visual acuity of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.40 logMAR. The depth of focus for a particular eye was defined as the width of the defocus curve, in diopters, at a given level of visual acuity. The retinal optical quality was obtained using pyramidal aberrometry (Osiris, CSO, Italy) and optical quality analyzer system (OQAS, Visiomettrics SL, Spain) obtaining the MTF and PSF for different diameters and open field aberrometer (OFA, CSO, Italy) measured for distance and near.

Main outcome measures Primary: Distance and near visual acuities, defocus curve, accommodation, depth of focus.

Secondary: Contrast sensitivity function, optical quality assessment, PROMs (quality of vision and quality of life reported by the patients), complications.","Inclusion Criteria:

Henry Ford Health System,OTHER,NCT05518279,Early Administration Of Tranexamic Acid And Acute Blood Loss In Patients With Hip Fractures,"Early Administration Of Tranexamic Acid And Acute Blood Loss In Patients With Hip Fractures: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-blinded, Placebo Controlled Trial","The study is a prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial that aims to investigate the hypothesis that early administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) following diagnosis of hip fracture will lower pre and postoperative blood loss and transfusion rates. Patients who present to the hospital with a hip fracture will be recruited and randomized into two treatment arms. The treatment group will receive 1950mg of oral TXA (three tablets, 650 mg each) and the control group will be given three tablets of oral placebo while in the Emergency Department. Patients will then be admitted to the Orthopaedic Trauma service and treated surgically with cephalomedullary nail, hemiarthroplasty, sliding hip screw, percutaneous screws, or total hip arthroplasty.","There remains a high incidence of blood transfusion in patients following hip fractures. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has well-studied efficacy in decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements in the context of general trauma, as well as several elective orthopaedic procedures. Although blood is lost in hip fracture surgery itself, it is also known that there is significant blood loss pre-operatively following the hip fracture event, particularly in extracapsular hip fractures. A prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial will elucidate the roll of early administration of TXA in a population of patients who sustain hip fractures. The study aims to investigate the hypothesis that early administration of TXA following diagnosis of hip fracture will lower pre and postoperative blood loss and transfusion rates. There will be two treatment arms in the study. The treatment group will be given 1950mg of oral TXA (3 tablets, 650mg each) in the emergency department following diagnosis of hip fracture. Those randomized to the control group will be given 3 tablets of oral placebo in the emergency department following diagnosis of hip fracture.

Patients who present to the hospital with a hip fracture will be recruited and randomized into two treatment arms.

Will outcomes observed in a high-risk operable transapical native valve TAVR cohort receiving an Edwards SAPIEN device compare to inoperable patients undergoing alternative access TAVR with the Edwards SAPIEN device experience a reasonably similar incidence of 30 day adverse events?","Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using the Edwards SAPIEN valve and Retroflex 3 delivery system provides both a mortality and quality of life benefit for inoperable patients. Only the transfemoral (TF) access has been approved in the US. A substantial number of patients cannot have a TF approach due to inadequate vessel size, vessel disease, or other anatomical considerations. The pivotal study did not include an assessment of safety and effectiveness of alternative access approaches in this inoperable patient group.

Early approaches to TAVR included a femoral transvenous approach with transseptal access to the left side for delivery of the valve. This approach avoided large bore arterial catheterization, but it had unacceptable rates of complications and lacked reproducibility. Alternative access approaches have been developed because of the risks associated with inserting large caliber catheters into small, diseased femoral arteries often associated with diffuse vasculopathy. To avoid the vascular complications from femoral access, other transcatheter approaches have been developed to include open surgical access to the left ventricular apex (TA), ascending aorta, (TAO), subclavian and axillary arteries (TS), and retroperitoneal access to the iliac artery (TI) as well as distal aorta. In addition to providing TAVR to patients who cannot have TF access, additional advantages include better catheter control and safer closure of the access site. Commonly cited disadvantages include the need for surgical expertise and additional equipment, along with the potential for longer recovery, more incisional pain, greater radiation exposure for operators, unsuitable delivery catheters for alternative access sites, and a host of unique alternative access site complications.

We propose to collectively analyze 30-day safety endpoints as a lumped data group for these alternative access approaches. These data are gathered from clinical practice in real-world settings and submitted to the TVT Registry. It is expected that centers will choose among the various choices for alternative access based the causative factors underlying the need for alternative access, as well as local skill sets and experience.

A recent systematic review suggests positive effects of music therapy (MT) on physiological measures of preterm infants and maternal anxiety, but methodologically rigorous studies including long-term follow-up of infant and parental outcomes are missing. Drawing upon caregivers' inherent resources, this study emphasizes caregiver involvement in MT to promote attuned, developmentally-appropriate musical interactions that may be of mutual benefit to infant and parent. This study will determine whether MT, as delivered by a qualified music therapist during neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization and/or in home/municipal settings following discharge, is superior to standard care in improving bonding between primary caregivers and preterm infants, parent well-being and infant development.

Methods: Design: International multi-center, assessor-blind, 2x2 factorial, pragmatic randomized controlled trial. A feasibility study has been completed; ethical approval for the main trial is pending. Participants: 250 preterm infants and their parents. Intervention: MT focusing on singing specifically tailored to infant responses, will be delivered during NICU and/or during a post-discharge 6-month period. Primary outcome: Changes in mother-infant bonding until 6 months corrected age (CA), as measured by the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes: Mother-infant bonding at discharge and over 12 months CA; child development over 24 months; and parental depression, anxiety, and stress, and infant re-hospitalization, all over 12 months.

Duke University,OTHER,NCT03288779,Theta Burst Stimulation for Schizophrenia,Theta Burst Stimulation for Schizophrenia,"Purpose and objective Schizophrenia is a chronic debilitating illness with cognitive deficits that cause serious impairment in psychosocial recovery and with few treatments to remediate these deficits. One area that holds great promise for the development of novel, effective therapies is noninvasive brain stimulation. The investigators have used one form of brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), for some time to modulate and enhance cognitive function in the brain, especially working memory (WM) function, which has a central role in most executive processing that occurs in the brain. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a paradigm of TMS which has been shown to effectively modulate WM. Moreover, TBS can modulate gamma neural oscillations in the brain and neural activity, both of which have been implicated in the physiology of WM and pathophysiology of the disease process in schizophrenia, making these measures highly valuable for assessing physiological effects of TBS on cognition, quality of life and cortical inhibition. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of TBS on WM in patients with schizophrenia, to develop evidence for potential brain stimulation techniques to treat cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

Study activities and population group: Study subjects will be inpatient schizophrenic individuals with minimal positive symptoms and predominant cognitive deficits at Duke University Hospital. In an initial session they will be screened and taught a WM task. Following this, one TBS session will follow in which TBS will target dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. They will perform the WM task before, with and after the TBS, with an expected pre-post enhancement of WM performance.

Implications - There is a great need for treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. The results of this study will serve to generate pilot data for a much larger grant to develop a TBS therapy for remediating such cognitive deficits.","Purpose of the study Aim1: Evaluate the effect of theta burst stimulation (TBS) on working memory (WM) in patients with schizophrenia. Hypothesis 1 - There will be significant improvement in WM compared to baseline with one session of TBS.

Background and Significance Schizophrenia is an illness known to have cognitive deficits, with a chronic and variable course. There is extensive research on cognitive deficits, with working memory, processing speed and verbal memory being some of the domains affected. Some modalities of treatment that have been tried to reverse these cognitive deficits are medications and cognitive behavioral therapy with minimal benefits. A few studies have shown modulation of working memory with routine repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at frequencies not exceeding 10 to 20 Hz of stimulation. Other studies have shown the working memory to be related to gamma oscillations. A few studies have also shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) modulates these gamma oscillations as well. There is an extensive body of literature that shows that working memory has contributions from theta and gamma oscillations in the brain. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), that entrains gamma and theta frequencies in the brain. It could be the most appropriate form of brain stimulation for improving cognition in schizophrenia patients because it has been shown to modulate brain oscillations in small samples of patients. The area for targeting would be the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex which is the site of origin of the gamma oscillations and plays a significant role in working memory.

Design and Procedures The study is designed to be a pilot one evaluating the effect of TBS on WM in patients with schizophrenia. The investigators plan to screen 20 subjects to have 10 participants. Working memory will be tested using delayed match sample task (DMS) and brief assessment of cognition in schizophrenia battery (BACS).

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) administration The patient would be transported from the inpatient unit to the TMS lab following screening and consent process. They would be accompanied by nursing staff. During their visit to the TMS lab a sample TMS session including motor threshold determination will be conducted. Subjects would be allowed to practice the DMS task to allow for the ceiling in practice effect of the task. The BACS would be administered before and after the TMS session.

Treatment Sessions Subjects would be administered left sided theta burst stimulation (TBS).The subject will be seated in a chair. A 64-channel electrode cap may be applied to the head for EEG recording. Electromyogram (EMG) electrodes will be applied to the right hand for motor evoked potential (MEP) recording. Subjects will perform the DMS task while sitting in the chair during the TMS session. EEG and EMG will be recorded throughout the treatment sessions. For theta burst stimulation the active motor threshold would be 80 % as used in most theta burst studies detailed in this review. Subjects would receive theta burst stimulation comprising 50 Hz bursts given at 3 to 5 Hz for close to 10 minutes which comprises 60 trains and 1800 pulses. The subject will be monitored until MEPs return to baseline. A side effects checklist will be completed at the beginning and at the end of the experimental session. All sessions will be performed by one of the protocol investigators, or by a trained and accredited research assistant supervised by the protocol investigators.

Clinical and cognitive assessments/tasks PANSS The Positive and negative symptoms scale is used to assess the severity of schizophrenia. It has three subscales - positive, negative and general psychopathology. Each of these subscales had 7 items, the maximum scores on each of these subscales in 49, minimum score being 7.

DMS task The DMS task is a modified version of the Sternberg task and has been adapted for use in cognitive paradigms accompanying transcranial magnetic stimulation. Each trial will last 13 s, with the following sequence of three task stages: encoding, retention and probe stages.

BACS - Tasks to be done from the actual BACS battery of tests List Learning (Verbal Memory). Patients are presented with 15 words and then asked to recall as many as possible. This procedure is repeated 5 times. There are two alternate forms.

Digit Sequencing Task (verbal working Memory). Patients are presented with clusters of numbers of increasing length. They are asked to tell the experimenter the numbers in order, from lowest to highest.

Token Motor Task (Motor Speed). Patients are given 100 plastic tokens and asked to place them into a container as quickly as possible for 60 seconds.

Verbal Fluency. Tests of Category Instances (Semantic Fluency) and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (Letter Fluency) are administered. Patients are given 60 seconds to name as many words as possible within a given semantic category, and in two separate trials, patients are given 60 seconds to generate as many words as possible that begin with a given letter. The total number of words from the three trials is the outcome measure.

Tower of London (Reasoning and Problem Solving). Patients look at two pictures simultaneously. Each picture shows 3 different-colored balls arranged on 3 pegs, with the balls in a unique arrangement in each picture. The patients are told about the rules in the task and are asked to provide the least number of times the balls in one picture would have to be moved to make the arrangement of balls identical to that of the other, opposing picture. There are two alternate forms.

Symbol Coding (Attention and Processing Speed). As quickly as possible, patients write numerals 1-9 as matches to symbols on a response sheet for 90 seconds.

Each of the six measures are compared to a healthy control sample to create z-scores, and a composite score is calculated by summing these z-scores and calculating a z-score of that sum. The composite score has high test-retest reliability in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls (ICCs \> .80).","Inclusion Criteria:

One area that holds great promise for the development of novel, effective therapies is noninvasive brain stimulation. The investigators have used one form of brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), for some time to modulate and enhance cognitive function in the brain, especially working memory (WM) function, which has a central role in most executive processing that occurs in the brain. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a paradigm of TMS which has been shown to effectively modulate WM. Moreover, TBS can modulate gamma neural oscillations in the brain and neural activity, both of which have been implicated in the physiology of WM and pathophysiology of the disease process in schizophrenia, making these measures highly valuable for assessing physiological effects of TBS on cognition, quality of life and cortical inhibition. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of TBS on WM in patients with schizophrenia, to develop evidence for potential brain stimulation techniques to treat cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Study activities and population group: Study subjects will be inpatient schizophrenic individuals with minimal positive symptoms and predominant cognitive deficits at Duke University Hospital. In an initial session they will be screened and taught a WM task. Following this, one TBS session will follow in which TBS will target dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. They will perform the WM task before, with and after the TBS, with an expected pre-post enhancement of WM performance.

Medipol University,OTHER,NCT03696979,The Effect of Myofascial Induction and Therapeutic Pain Education in Chronic Low Back Pain,The Effect of Myofascial Induction and Therapeutic Pain Education in Chronic Low Back Pain,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of therapeutic pain education and myofascial induction therapy on pain and function in patients with chronic low back pain. In the literature, studies on myofascial induction therapy in patients with chronic low back pain are very limited and there is no study comparing therapeutic pain training.","Lumbar pain has become a major health problem which is growing and is very common in all societies and negatively affects the full well-being of the individual. It has been reported that 80% of the population experienced low back pain at any time in their lives. The prolongation of this painful process affects the physical, mental and psychological state of the patient and limits its daily functions. The acute or chronic pain determines the nature and duration of pain. Low back pain lasting 12 weeks or more is defined as chronic. In chronic diseases, lumbar pain, which is the first one, restricts the daily activities of the person due to current chronic pain or deterioration of functional status and causes loss of labor force.

Myofascial induction therapy is a therapy concept focused on optimizing function and balance within the fascial system. The approach aims at global recovery, local correction and painless body use.

Superficial procedures are directed to surface and / or local restrictions that can be directly detected by palpation. Deep myofascial induction therapy is a method that eliminates the limitations of the myofascial system and the three-dimensional pressures.

In the literature, studies on myofascial induction therapy in patients with chronic low back pain are very limited and there is no study comparing therapeutic pain training.

Aim: To evaluate the effect of white noise and swaddling on pain, heart rate, and oxygen saturation in term infants undergoing post-discharge eye examinations. This study was conducted with term infants born 30-36 days postpartum who visited the ophthalmologic outpatient clinic for eye screening. A total of 120 term infants were included in the sample, divided into three intervention groups: the white noise group (n=30), the swaddling group (n=30), and the white noise + swaddling group (n=30), along with a control group (n=30). Data were collected by the clinic nurse before the eye examination, 30 seconds into the examination, and at the end of the examination. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scale and pulse oximetry were used for data collection.There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores, heart rates, or oxygen saturation (SpO2) between the intervention and control groups (p\>0.05). In all groups, pain scores and heart rates were higher, and SpO2 values were lower after the ophthalmologic examination than before the examination (p\<0.001).Swaddling + white noise, white noise, and swaddling during the eye examination procedure did not affect reducing infants' pain or improving heart rate and oxygen saturation values.","Early childhood is a critical period for identifying and treating eye diseases, as problems that develop during this time can lead to permanent vision loss. It is recommended that term infants be evaluated for congenital cataracts, congenital glaucoma, retinoblastoma, strabismus, amblyopia, and refractive errors. An estimated 20,000-40,000 babies are born with bilateral cataracts each year globally, leading to blindness in over 14 million children. Congenital glaucoma, a developmental disorder that can be unilateral or bilateral, often occurs at birth or within the first few months of life and can damage the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. The incidence of congenital glaucoma in developed countries is approximately 1 in 10,000-20,000 births. Infections such as rubella and cytomegalovirus (CMV) during pregnancy can also cause cataracts and glaucoma in infants. Detecting risk factors that could impede normal vision development through infant vision screening and providing early treatment helps prevent vision loss and blindness. In Turkey, the national vision screening program includes routine eye examinations and red reflex tests conducted by family physicians for infants aged 0-3 years. Additionally, term infants who do not require intensive care undergo detailed examinations for eye diseases like congenital cataracts and glaucoma at two reference hospitals designated by the Ministry of Health. These examinations use similar methods to those employed in retinopathy of prematurity (RP) screening.

Eye examinations for screening and early diagnosis can be painful and stressful for infants. Exposure to pain can lead to hypersensitivity to painful stimuli, a decreased pain threshold, and altered cortex development in the short term, as well as long-term behavioral problems and learning difficulties. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize pain and stress during these examinations. Systemic pharmacological analgesics used to reduce pain in infants can negatively impact their early brain development, nutrition, socialization, and memory in later years. Currently, non-pharmacologic methods to reduce pain in infants are gaining prominence. These methods are more cost-effective, easier to administer, and safer compared to pharmacologic approaches. They can also be used in combination with pharmacologic treatments. Various non-pharmacological methods frequently used for analgesia in newborns and infants include kangaroo care, swaddling, non-nutritive sucking, exposure to specific odors (such as from the mother, breast milk, or aromatic scents), sucrose, glucose, breast milk, music therapy, massage, white noise, and acupuncture. During eye examinations, blefastop is used to keep the baby's eyelids open, and a scleral depressor is employed to assess the bottom of the eye and move the eye sideways, causing discomfort. The white light source used by the ophthalmologist further unsettles the baby. Studies have explored different non-pharmacologic methods to reduce pain during eye examinations in premature infants, including touch, positioning, non-nutritive sucking, breast milk, glucose, sucrose, white noise, and music. However, these studies have yielded conflicting results, and the evidence remains insufficient. Upon reviewing the literature, no studies were encountered comparing the effects of non-pharmacologic methods on reducing pain during eye examinations in term infants. There is a need for further research to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacologic methods in alleviating pain during post-discharge eye examinations in term infants.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of white noise and swaddling on interventional pain, heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) in term infants undergoing hospital eye examinations for post-discharge vision screening.

Hypotheses of the Study:

H01: Playing white noise to babies during eye examinations does not affect pain scores, heart rate, or oxygen saturation.

H02: Swaddling infants during eye examinations does not affect pain scores, heart rate, or oxygen saturation.

H03: Swaddling combined with listening to white noise during eye examinations does not affect pain scores, heart rate, or oxygen saturation.

Methods This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled experimental study. The study was conducted in the neonatal eye outpatient clinic of a maternity hospital.In this hospital, healthy infants who do not require intensive care after birth are given screening eye examinations once between the 30th and 36th days after birth. Approximately 400 infants who do not need intensive care are admitted to the neonatal eye outpatient clinic each month. Participants were divided into four groups: three intervention groups and one control group. Infants were assigned to these groups using simple random sampling to ensure homogeneity and prevent selection bias. The sample size was calculated using the G-Power 3.0.10 program. With a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, α = 0.05, effect size = 0.159, and power (1 - β) = 0.80, a total sample size of 108 was calculated for the four groups, with at least 27 infants in each group. The study included 120 infants divided into the swaddling group (n=30), white noise group (n=30), white noise + swaddling group (n=30), and control group (n=30) (Figure 1). The sample included infants with a gestational age of \>37 6/7 weeks, birth weight ≥2000 g, a 5th minute Apgar score ≥7, aged 30-36 days postpartum, and undergoing their first eye examination. The exclusion criteria included a history of hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit, postnatal resuscitation, presence or suspicion of a congenital and/or genetic disease, hearing problems, surgical operation for any reason, or systemic analgesic administration within the last six hours. No infants dropped out of the study during the study period.Interventions Infants who were swaddled during the eye examination constituted the swaddling group (Intervention Group-1). Infants who listened to white noise constituted the white noise group (Intervention Group-2). Infants who were both swaddled and listened to white noise during the eye examination constituted the White Noise + Swaddling group (Intervention Group-3). The control group received routine care and follow-up. The outpatient clinic nurse (third researcher) numbered the babies according to their order of admission and assigned them to groups by simple randomization. All infants were examined by the same ophthalmologist (fourth investigator). Another outpatient nurse, who was not part of the research team, measured the infants' pain scores, heart rate, and oxygen saturation at three different times: before the examination (T1), 30 seconds after the ophthalmologist started the first eye examination (T2), and immediately after the examination of the second eye was finished (T3).

Eye Examination Preparation: All infants included in the study (intervention groups 1, 2, and 3, as well as the control group) underwent routine procedures performed in the eye outpatient clinic before the examination. During this stage, pupil dilation was initiated in the waiting room. According to the hospital's standard procedure, the pupil dilation process involved instilling phenylephrine and tropicamide eye drops twice at five-minute intervals (Liu et al., 2017). Approximately 45 minutes later, once the pupils were dilated, each infant was taken to the preparation room. One drop of proparacaine was instilled into both eyes of the infants before the examination. Proparacaine-containing drops are used to provide topical anesthesia for rapid and short-term diagnostic or surgical procedures (Bashinsky, 2017). The third researcher then took the infants into the examination room and placed them on the examination table. A pulse oximetry probe was attached to the left foot of all infants.

Eye Examination Procedure

The third investigator placed the infant in a supine position and fixed the infant's head in a midline, slightly extended position. The eye examination was performed by an ophthalmologist (the fourth researcher). Each eye examination took approximately one to one and a half minutes. The groups were as follows:

Swaddling group (n=30) The third researcher swaddled each infant with its thin blanket. The swaddling involved bringing the infant's left hand close to the left buttock and wrapping it with the upper right end of the blanket. Similarly, she wrapped the baby's right hand with the upper left end of the blanket by bringing it closer to the right hip. She wrapped the baby's legs with the lower part of the blanket, ensuring that the baby's head could move freely.

White Noise Group (n=30) The third researcher turned on white noise (rain sound; link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZeM-HZeneo) before the start of the eye examination and played it to the infants until the end of the examination.

White Noise + Swaddling Group (n=30) The third researcher swaddled the infants in this group as described in the swaddling group and turned on the white noise (rain sound; link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZeM-HZeneo) before the examination started and played it to the infants until the examination was over.

Control Group (n=30) Babies in this group received care in accordance with the hospital routine. In the hospital routine, babies are examined with the clothes they are wearing during the examination, and no non-pharmacologic method is applied during the procedure.

All data collection was performed by a single outpatient nurse who was not part of the research team. This nurse works in the neonatal eye outpatient clinic and has a neonatal intensive care nursing certificate.

Data Collection Tools Infant Information and Monitoring Form The form was prepared by researchers (Baş et al., 2015; Francis, 2016; Sun et al., 2020; Turan et al., 2021) and consisted of 11 questions. The form included information about the infant's demographic characteristics, gestational age, birth weight, mode of delivery, gender, postnatal age, diet, Apgar score, oxygen therapy, and phototherapy. Additionally, T1, T2, and T3 pain scores, heart rates, and oxygen saturation levels were recorded.

The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) The pain score of the infants was evaluated using the PIPP. The Turkish validity and reliability of the scale, developed by Stevens et al. (2014), were performed by Taplak and Bayat (2019). The scale assesses seven items: gestational age, behavioral status, highest heart rate, lowest oxygen saturation value, forehead wrinkling, squinting, and widening of the wings of the nose. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (from good to bad), with higher scores indicating greater pain. The total PIPP score ranges from 0 to 21, where 0-6 points indicate mild pain, 7-12 points indicate moderate pain, and 13-21 points indicate severe pain (Stevens et al., 2014).

Ethical Approval All procedures were conducted in compliance with the ethical standards of the Institutional and National Research Committee and within the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was obtained from the institution and the ethics committee (date: October 26, 2020, number: E2-22-2419). The parents of the babies were informed about the purpose, method, and other details of the study. They signed a written consent form before the study commenced.

Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS (version 27, IBM) package program. Descriptive statistics were used to interpret the findings. ""Pearson-χ2"" cross-tabulations were employed to examine the relationship between two qualitative variables. For normally distributed data, the ""ANOVA"" test (F-table value) was used to compare three or more independent groups, and the ""Repeated Measures"" test (F-table value) was used to compare three or more dependent groups. For non-normally distributed data, the ""Kruskal-Wallis H"" test (χ2-table value) was used to compare three or more independent groups, and the ""Friedman"" test (χ2-table value) was used to compare three or more dependent groups.","Inclusion Criteria:

Aim: To evaluate the effect of white noise and swaddling on pain, heart rate, and oxygen saturation in term infants undergoing post-discharge eye examinations. This study was conducted with term infants born 30-36 days postpartum who visited the ophthalmologic outpatient clinic for eye screening. A total of 120 term infants were included in the sample, divided into three intervention groups: the white noise group (n=30), the swaddling group (n=30), and the white noise + swaddling group (n=30), along with a control group (n=30). Data were collected by the clinic nurse before the eye examination, 30 seconds into the examination, and at the end of the examination. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scale and pulse oximetry were used for data collection.There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores, heart rates, or oxygen saturation (SpO2) between the intervention and control groups (p\>0.05). In all groups, pain scores and heart rates were higher, and SpO2 values were lower after the ophthalmologic examination than before the examination (p\<0.001).Swaddling + white noise, white noise, and swaddling during the eye examination procedure did not affect reducing infants' pain or improving heart rate and oxygen saturation values. Early childhood is a critical period for identifying and treating eye diseases, as problems that develop during this time can lead to permanent vision loss. It is recommended that term infants be evaluated for congenital cataracts, congenital glaucoma, retinoblastoma, strabismus, amblyopia, and refractive errors. An estimated 20,000-40,000 babies are born with bilateral cataracts each year globally, leading to blindness in over 14 million children. Congenital glaucoma, a developmental disorder that can be unilateral or bilateral, often occurs at birth or within the first few months of life and can damage the optic nerve, leading to vision loss. The incidence of congenital glaucoma in developed countries is approximately 1 in 10,000-20,000 births. Infections such as rubella and cytomegalovirus (CMV) during pregnancy can also cause cataracts and glaucoma in infants. Detecting risk factors that could impede normal vision development through infant vision screening and providing early treatment helps prevent vision loss and blindness. In Turkey, the national vision screening program includes routine eye examinations and red reflex tests conducted by family physicians for infants aged 0-3 years. Additionally, term infants who do not require intensive care undergo detailed examinations for eye diseases like congenital cataracts and glaucoma at two reference hospitals designated by the Ministry of Health. These examinations use similar methods to those employed in retinopathy of prematurity (RP) screening. Eye examinations for screening and early diagnosis can be painful and stressful for infants. Exposure to pain can lead to hypersensitivity to painful stimuli, a decreased pain threshold, and altered cortex development in the short term, as well as long-term behavioral problems and learning difficulties. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize pain and stress during these examinations. Systemic pharmacological analgesics used to reduce pain in infants can negatively impact their early brain development, nutrition, socialization, and memory in later years. Currently, non-pharmacologic methods to reduce pain in infants are gaining prominence. These methods are more cost-effective, easier to administer, and safer compared to pharmacologic approaches. They can also be used in combination with pharmacologic treatments. Various non-pharmacological methods frequently used for analgesia in newborns and infants include kangaroo care, swaddling, non-nutritive sucking, exposure to specific odors (such as from the mother, breast milk, or aromatic scents), sucrose, glucose, breast milk, music therapy, massage, white noise, and acupuncture. During eye examinations, blefastop is used to keep the baby's eyelids open, and a scleral depressor is employed to assess the bottom of the eye and move the eye sideways, causing discomfort. The white light source used by the ophthalmologist further unsettles the baby. Studies have explored different non-pharmacologic methods to reduce pain during eye examinations in premature infants, including touch, positioning, non-nutritive sucking, breast milk, glucose, sucrose, white noise, and music. However, these studies have yielded conflicting results, and the evidence remains insufficient. Upon reviewing the literature, no studies were encountered comparing the effects of non-pharmacologic methods on reducing pain during eye examinations in term infants. There is a need for further research to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmacologic methods in alleviating pain during post-discharge eye examinations in term infants. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of white noise and swaddling on interventional pain, heart rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) in term infants undergoing hospital eye examinations for post-discharge vision screening. Hypotheses of the Study: H01: Playing white noise to babies during eye examinations does not affect pain scores, heart rate, or oxygen saturation. H02: Swaddling infants during eye examinations does not affect pain scores, heart rate, or oxygen saturation. H03: Swaddling combined with listening to white noise during eye examinations does not affect pain scores, heart rate, or oxygen saturation. Methods This study was a prospective, randomized, controlled experimental study. The study was conducted in the neonatal eye outpatient clinic of a maternity hospital.In this hospital, healthy infants who do not require intensive care after birth are given screening eye examinations once between the 30th and 36th days after birth. Approximately 400 infants who do not need intensive care are admitted to the neonatal eye outpatient clinic each month. Participants were divided into four groups: three intervention groups and one control group. Infants were assigned to these groups using simple random sampling to ensure homogeneity and prevent selection bias. The sample size was calculated using the G-Power 3.0.10 program. With a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, α = 0.05, effect size = 0.159, and power (1 - β) = 0.80, a total sample size of 108 was calculated for the four groups, with at least 27 infants in each group. The study included 120 infants divided into the swaddling group (n=30), white noise group (n=30), white noise + swaddling group (n=30), and control group (n=30) (Figure 1). The sample included infants with a gestational age of \>37 6/7 weeks, birth weight ≥2000 g, a 5th minute Apgar score ≥7, aged 30-36 days postpartum, and undergoing their first eye examination. The exclusion criteria included a history of hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit, postnatal resuscitation, presence or suspicion of a congenital and/or genetic disease, hearing problems, surgical operation for any reason, or systemic analgesic administration within the last six hours. No infants dropped out of the study during the study period.Interventions Infants who were swaddled during the eye examination constituted the swaddling group (Intervention Group-1). Infants who listened to white noise constituted the white noise group (Intervention Group-2). Infants who were both swaddled and listened to white noise during the eye examination constituted the White Noise + Swaddling group (Intervention Group-3). The control group received routine care and follow-up. The outpatient clinic nurse (third researcher) numbered the babies according to their order of admission and assigned them to groups by simple randomization. All infants were examined by the same ophthalmologist (fourth investigator). Another outpatient nurse, who was not part of the research team, measured the infants' pain scores, heart rate, and oxygen saturation at three different times: before the examination (T1), 30 seconds after the ophthalmologist started the first eye examination (T2), and immediately after the examination of the second eye was finished (T3). Eye Examination Preparation: All infants included in the study (intervention groups 1, 2, and 3, as well as the control group) underwent routine procedures performed in the eye outpatient clinic before the examination. During this stage, pupil dilation was initiated in the waiting room. According to the hospital's standard procedure, the pupil dilation process involved instilling phenylephrine and tropicamide eye drops twice at five-minute intervals (Liu et al., 2017). Approximately 45 minutes later, once the pupils were dilated, each infant was taken to the preparation room. One drop of proparacaine was instilled into both eyes of the infants before the examination. Proparacaine-containing drops are used to provide topical anesthesia for rapid and short-term diagnostic or surgical procedures (Bashinsky, 2017). The third researcher then took the infants into the examination room and placed them on the examination table. A pulse oximetry probe was attached to the left foot of all infants. Eye Examination Procedure The third investigator placed the infant in a supine position and fixed the infant's head in a midline, slightly extended position. The eye examination was performed by an ophthalmologist (the fourth researcher). Each eye examination took approximately one to one and a half minutes. The groups were as follows: Swaddling group (n=30) The third researcher swaddled each infant with its thin blanket. The swaddling involved bringing the infant's left hand close to the left buttock and wrapping it with the upper right end of the blanket. Similarly, she wrapped the baby's right hand with the upper left end of the blanket by bringing it closer to the right hip.

Stanford University,OTHER,NCT02437084,"Relationship Between Insulin Resistance and Statin Induced Type 2 Diabetes, and Integrative Personal Omics Profiling","Relationship Between Insulin Resistance and Statin Induced Type 2 Diabetes, and Integrative Personal Omics Profiling","Background:

There is general agreement that statin-treatment of patients to lower plasma cholesterol levels can increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in some individuals1-5. The physiologic mechanism for the increased risk for T2D from statin treatment is unknown but could result from effects on insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. This study will evaluate how the medication atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor) works in non-diabetic individuals in regards to its effect on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to help further understand the possible cause of the increased occurrence of T2D in people who are at risk for T2D. This research study will also examine what metabolic characteristics and variables (for example insulin resistance, high triglycerides, or both) will identify those people at highest risk of statin-induced T2D.

The goals of this study are to:

1. determine the effect of high-intensity atorvastatin (40 mg/day) for \~ 10 weeks on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (defined with gold standard methods) (PRIMARY OUTCOMES) as well as other glycemic traits (SECONDARY OUTCOMES);
2. compare a number of cardio-metabolic characteristics (e.g. weight, lipids) before, during, and after administration of atorvastatin;
3. determine if significant deterioration of insulin action and/or secretion following statin treatment will be confined to those with baseline insulin resistance (PRE-SPECIFIED SUBGROUP ANALYSES);
4. perform Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) 6,7 before and after taking atorvastatin to examine treatment-associated changes in all baseline variables and to analyze not only previously-known drug efficacy but also untargeted drug efficacy (EXPLORATORY ANALYSES).

General approach:

This will be an open-label study to evaluate the diabetogenic effect of atorvastatin (40 mg/day for 10 weeks) on both insulin action and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. To ensure we recruit individuals across a broad range of insulin sensitivity, we will target recruitment to enrich for those with combined increases in LDL-C and TG concentrations (see SIGNIFICANCE and RATIONALE). The experimental population will consist of \~75 apparently healthy, non-diabetic volunteers eligible for statin therapy but without pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Following baseline assessments of co-primary outcome measures: insulin sensitivity (by insulin suppression test, IST) and insulin secretion (by graded glucose infusion test, GGIT), participants will be placed on a weight maintenance diet and treated with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin. All baseline measurements will be repeated \~10 weeks later with iPOP8 measurements done at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, and 10 on atorvastatin, and at weeks 4 and 8 off atorvastatin.","1. SIGNIFICANCE

   Statins and the risk of T2D: Statin treatment is associated with an increase in incident T2D.1-4 5

   Mechanism of statin-induced T2D: It is unclear whether statins increase the risk of T2D by decreasing insulin action, secretion, or both. Several manuscripts have been published that substantially increase understanding of the link between statin use and incident T2D. Swerdlow, et al.2 based on evidence from genetic analysis and randomized trials, concluded that the increased risk of T2D noted with statins is at least ""partially explained by HMG-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibition."" They also noted an association of weight gain with HMGCR variants in statin-treated patients, leading to the notion that decreases in insulin sensitivity contribute to statin-induced diabetes. In that context, Cederberg, at al.9 have shown in a large prospective study (n=8749 men) that participants treated with statins (n=2142) had a 46% increase in incident T2D, associated with a 24% decrease in insulin sensitivity and a 12% decrease in insulin secretion assessed by surrogate measures.

   Identifying those with at enhanced risk of statin-induced T2D: Studies of 3 randomized clinical trials with atorvastatin by David Waters' group 1,3,4 have demonstrated that ""baseline fasting glucose, body mass index, hypertension, and fasting triglycerides were independent predictors of T2D."" These abnormalities form a cluster attributed to insulin resistance.10 Since insulin resistance is a predictor of developing T2D, it seems likely that the more insulin resistant the individuals are before treatment, the greater is their risk to for statin-induced T2D.

   In that context, relatively little attention has been given to the role that metabolic heterogeneity in patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations might play in statin-induced T2D. Specifically, subjects with elevated LDL-C concentrations, whose plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations are also elevated, are insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic, and glucose intolerant as compared to those with isolated LDL-C levels. As such, this subset of patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations can be viewed as being at a ""tipping point,"" and any adverse effect of statins on insulin action and/or secretion, irrespective of how mediated, places them at enhanced risk to develop statin-induced diabetes. Indeed, we have shown (Kohli et al)1 that patients with both insulin resistance (as estimated by high TGs) and prediabetes are at particularly high risk of statin-induced T2D.

   We seek to address 2 important unanswered questions: Do statins primarily affect insulin resistance or insulin secretion?; Are there subsets of individuals at highest risk of statin-induced T2D?
2. RATIONALE, HYPOTHESIS

   Rationale:

   T2D develops when insulin resistant individuals cannot maintain the degree of compensatory hyperinsulinemia needed to maintain normal glucose tolerance. However, significant fundamental questions remain. For example, what is the cellular/molecular link between statin treatment and changes in insulin action and secretion?

   This proposal is based on the premise that studying the effect of statins on insulin action and insulin secretion using ""gold standard"" methods will help determine if statins adversely affect the risk of T2D by increasing insulin resistance or decreasing insulin secretion. We use the insulin suppression test (with the read-out of steady-state plasma glucose, SSPG) to ascertain insulin sensitivity and the graded glucose infusion test (with the readout of insulin secretion rate, ISR) to ascertain insulin secretion both before and after statin treatment in non-diabetic individuals.

   We hypothesize that treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance. Thus, we plan to look at the effect of atorvastatin not only in all participants but also in subsets of individuals with baseline insulin resistance (which will be enriched for by recruiting volunteers with elevated plasma TG levels (≥150 mg/dL) at baseline. The rationale for this is that plasma TGs are a surrogate measure for insulin resistance with a modest correlation with the direct measure of insulin resistance (steady-state plasma glucose) measured by the insulin suppression test. Clinically, subjects with elevated TGs prior to statin treatment would have substantial clinical benefit from statins, and one of investigators' secondary goals is to demonstrate that a simple measurement of plasma TG concentration (as a surrogate for insulin resistance) can help identify those most at risk of statin induced derangements in glycemic control. Consequently, we propose to enroll nondiabetic volunteers at high-risk for T2D, free of known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), not receiving statins, eligible for statin therapy according to ACC/AHA (American College for Cardiology/American Heart Association) 2013 guidelines.11 We will also target recruitment efforts to enrich for subjects with plasma TG concentration ≥ 150 mg/dL to ensure that we enroll subjects across the range of insulin sensitivity.

   Hypothesis: We hypothesize that high intensity atorvastatin treatment for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance.
3. STUDY DESIGN

   Sample Size

   • We aim to recruit and retain 75 total participants in this study.

   Study Location

   • Clinical and Translational Research Unit (CTRU) at 800 Welch Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304.

   Duration

   • We anticipate that the entire study will take 4 - 5 years through the end of data analysis. Each eligible candidate who voluntarily consents to participate in the study will be active in the study for a total of 5 months from screening to the end of their last visit.
4. STUDY PROCEDURES

   Recruitment

   Preliminary recruitment strategies will include:

   Volunteers will be recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area through advertisements in newspapers, posted flyers, and the social networking site NextDoor as well as from the Preventive Cardiology Clinics at Stanford Health Care. Our goal is to ensure recruitment across a broad range of insulin sensitivity. Prior work from our group and others has shown that high plasma TG concentrations are associated with increased insulin resistance as assessed by reference measures. Therefore, we will target advertisements to enrich for individuals with high TG levels (\> 150 mg/dL) as a surrogate for increased insulin resistance.

   Participant Visits and Procedures

   Potential participants will be screened initially when they call or email in response to recruitment ads, or a letter from their MD, describing the study as follows:

   Preliminary intake will occur over the phone.

   Visit 1 Screening visit.

   Visit 2: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): This test will take approximately 3 hours.

   i) Glycemic status: Participants will be classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or combined IFG/IGT12. In addition, the total integrated plasma glucose response during the OGTT will be calculated by the trapezoidal method (Glucose-AUC).

   ii) β-cell function: Calculations of the Insulin Secretion- Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) will be used to quantify insulin secretory function 13, if for some reason a graded glucose infusion study is not done. The ISSI-2 is a validated OGTT- derived method to measure of β-cell function, analogous to the disposition index obtained from the intravenous glucose tolerance test 14. It is calculated by multiplying the insulin secretory response during the OGTT (Insulin-AUC/Glucose-AUC) by insulin resistance (Matsuda index).

   The fasting and 2-hour glucose results will be discussed with the study participant and a copy of the results will be given to them.

   Visit 3. Graded Glucose Infusion, GGIT 15,16: This test will take approximately 6 hours.

   This test is designed to assess the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin in response to a graded glucose infusion. During this test, subjects will have two small IV catheters placed, one in each arm. One IV will be used for drawing samples and the other for the infusion of glucose. During the GGIT, continuous intravenous infusions of glucose will be given at progressively increasing rates: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 kg/min in six infusion periods of 40-min duration. Blood samples will be collected for measurements of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations at fasting and at 30 min and 40 min into each infusion period. The two values during the last 10 min of each infusion period will be averaged. The amount of blood taken for this test will 47.5 ml.

   Visit 4.Insulin Suppression test, IST 17,18: This test will take approximately 6 hours.

   This test is designed to determine whole body insulin sensitivity. Following an overnight fast, subjects will have an IV placed in each arm. One for collection of blood and the other for infusion with octreotide (0.27 μg/m2/min), insulin (32 mU/m2/min), and glucose (267 mg/m2/min) for 180 minutes. During the test, endogenous insulin is suppressed and all individuals are given the same concentration of insulin, based on their body surface area. Blood is drawn every 30 minutes for 150 minutes and then at 10-minute intervals from 150 to 180 minutes of the infusion to measure plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. The mean of the last four values is used as the steady-state plasma insulin (SSPI) and glucose (SSPG) concentrations for each individual. As SSPI concentrations are similar in all subjects during the IST, the SSPG concentration provides a direct measure of the ability of insulin to mediate disposal of an infused glucose load; the higher the SSPG concentration, the more insulin resistant the individual. Labs to check kidney and liver function plus a lipid panel and a urine pregnancy test (if appropriate) will be done at this visit. Blood drawn or IST will be 58.5 ml and 5 ml for SHC labs.

   Labs for iPOP will be drawn at this time and additional samples will be obtained for transcriptome, microbiome, metabolome, and proteome analysis in blood; nasal, tongue, skin surface swabs; urine; and stool.

   The study drug, atorvastatin 40 mg will be given to study participants, once all labs have been reviewed and participant qualifies.

   Visit 5-7: Visits will be every 2 weeks for a total of 10 weeks on study medication (statin). Participants will be assessed for any side effects or adverse events (AE) on the statin. Adherence to study medication will be assessed at each visit.

   Visit 8: Weight, vital signs, and OGTT described above.

   Visit 9: Repeat GGIT as described above.

   Visit 10: Repeat IST and iPOP lab testing and samples as described above. At the end of this visit, the statin will be stopped and the study participant would be scheduled for 4- and 8-week follow up visits.

   Visit 11: One month off statin study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above.

   Visit 12: Last study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above.

   Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaire about her/his physical activity status, food and eating habits, and stress at the time of each iPOP.
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Based on our prior work19, we calculated that with 60 subjects, we would be able to detect an 8% change in SSPG concentration and an 8% change in ISRAUC after atorvastatin therapy with 80% power and two-side significance level of 5% using a paired samples t test. Thus, we estimated needing to enroll 75 subjects with an anticipated a dropout rate of 20%.

Summary statistics will be reported as median (interquartile range) or number (percent) of participants unless otherwise specified. Shapiro-Wilk tests will be used to assess normality of data, and variables that are not normally distributed will be log-transformed. Percent changes in variables will be calculated by the formula: \[(end-of study value) - (baseline value) / baseline value\] x 100. Paired samples t tests will be used to compare baseline and end-of-study means. One sample t tests will be employed to evaluate whether percent changes in variables are significantly different from zero (no change). Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated to determine the strength of association between variables of interest. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be carried out by stratifying for insulin resistant versus insulin sensitive subjects. The SSPG concentration median will be used to define subjects as being insulin resistant or insulin sensitive. Insulin resistant and insulin sensitive group means will be compared by independent sample t tests and proportions by chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Statistical analyses will be performed by using statistical software IBM SPSS version 26.0.","Inclusion Criteria:

The physiologic mechanism for the increased risk for T2D from statin treatment is unknown but could result from effects on insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. This study will evaluate how the medication atorvastatin (trade name Lipitor) works in non-diabetic individuals in regards to its effect on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to help further understand the possible cause of the increased occurrence of T2D in people who are at risk for T2D. This research study will also examine what metabolic characteristics and variables (for example insulin resistance, high triglycerides, or both) will identify those people at highest risk of statin-induced T2D. The goals of this study are to: 1. determine the effect of high-intensity atorvastatin (40 mg/day) for \~ 10 weeks on insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (defined with gold standard methods) (PRIMARY OUTCOMES) as well as other glycemic traits (SECONDARY OUTCOMES); 2. compare a number of cardio-metabolic characteristics (e.g. weight, lipids) before, during, and after administration of atorvastatin; 3. determine if significant deterioration of insulin action and/or secretion following statin treatment will be confined to those with baseline insulin resistance (PRE-SPECIFIED SUBGROUP ANALYSES); 4. perform Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) 6,7 before and after taking atorvastatin to examine treatment-associated changes in all baseline variables and to analyze not only previously-known drug efficacy but also untargeted drug efficacy (EXPLORATORY ANALYSES). General approach: This will be an open-label study to evaluate the diabetogenic effect of atorvastatin (40 mg/day for 10 weeks) on both insulin action and insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. To ensure we recruit individuals across a broad range of insulin sensitivity, we will target recruitment to enrich for those with combined increases in LDL-C and TG concentrations (see SIGNIFICANCE and RATIONALE). The experimental population will consist of \~75 apparently healthy, non-diabetic volunteers eligible for statin therapy but without pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Following baseline assessments of co-primary outcome measures: insulin sensitivity (by insulin suppression test, IST) and insulin secretion (by graded glucose infusion test, GGIT), participants will be placed on a weight maintenance diet and treated with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin. All baseline measurements will be repeated \~10 weeks later with iPOP8 measurements done at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, and 10 on atorvastatin, and at weeks 4 and 8 off atorvastatin. 1. SIGNIFICANCE Statins and the risk of T2D: Statin treatment is associated with an increase in incident T2D.1-4 5 Mechanism of statin-induced T2D: It is unclear whether statins increase the risk of T2D by decreasing insulin action, secretion, or both. Several manuscripts have been published that substantially increase understanding of the link between statin use and incident T2D. Swerdlow, et al.2 based on evidence from genetic analysis and randomized trials, concluded that the increased risk of T2D noted with statins is at least ""partially explained by HMG-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibition."" They also noted an association of weight gain with HMGCR variants in statin-treated patients, leading to the notion that decreases in insulin sensitivity contribute to statin-induced diabetes. In that context, Cederberg, at al.9 have shown in a large prospective study (n=8749 men) that participants treated with statins (n=2142) had a 46% increase in incident T2D, associated with a 24% decrease in insulin sensitivity and a 12% decrease in insulin secretion assessed by surrogate measures. Identifying those with at enhanced risk of statin-induced T2D: Studies of 3 randomized clinical trials with atorvastatin by David Waters' group 1,3,4 have demonstrated that ""baseline fasting glucose, body mass index, hypertension, and fasting triglycerides were independent predictors of T2D."" These abnormalities form a cluster attributed to insulin resistance.10 Since insulin resistance is a predictor of developing T2D, it seems likely that the more insulin resistant the individuals are before treatment, the greater is their risk to for statin-induced T2D. In that context, relatively little attention has been given to the role that metabolic heterogeneity in patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations might play in statin-induced T2D. Specifically, subjects with elevated LDL-C concentrations, whose plasma triglyceride (TG) concentrations are also elevated, are insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic, and glucose intolerant as compared to those with isolated LDL-C levels. As such, this subset of patients with elevated LDL-C concentrations can be viewed as being at a ""tipping point,"" and any adverse effect of statins on insulin action and/or secretion, irrespective of how mediated, places them at enhanced risk to develop statin-induced diabetes. Indeed, we have shown (Kohli et al)1 that patients with both insulin resistance (as estimated by high TGs) and prediabetes are at particularly high risk of statin-induced T2D. We seek to address 2 important unanswered questions: Do statins primarily affect insulin resistance or insulin secretion?; Are there subsets of individuals at highest risk of statin-induced T2D? 2. RATIONALE, HYPOTHESIS Rationale: T2D develops when insulin resistant individuals cannot maintain the degree of compensatory hyperinsulinemia needed to maintain normal glucose tolerance. However, significant fundamental questions remain. For example, what is the cellular/molecular link between statin treatment and changes in insulin action and secretion? This proposal is based on the premise that studying the effect of statins on insulin action and insulin secretion using ""gold standard"" methods will help determine if statins adversely affect the risk of T2D by increasing insulin resistance or decreasing insulin secretion. We use the insulin suppression test (with the read-out of steady-state plasma glucose, SSPG) to ascertain insulin sensitivity and the graded glucose infusion test (with the readout of insulin secretion rate, ISR) to ascertain insulin secretion both before and after statin treatment in non-diabetic individuals. We hypothesize that treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance. Thus, we plan to look at the effect of atorvastatin not only in all participants but also in subsets of individuals with baseline insulin resistance (which will be enriched for by recruiting volunteers with elevated plasma TG levels (≥150 mg/dL) at baseline. The rationale for this is that plasma TGs are a surrogate measure for insulin resistance with a modest correlation with the direct measure of insulin resistance (steady-state plasma glucose) measured by the insulin suppression test. Clinically, subjects with elevated TGs prior to statin treatment would have substantial clinical benefit from statins, and one of investigators' secondary goals is to demonstrate that a simple measurement of plasma TG concentration (as a surrogate for insulin resistance) can help identify those most at risk of statin induced derangements in glycemic control. Consequently, we propose to enroll nondiabetic volunteers at high-risk for T2D, free of known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), not receiving statins, eligible for statin therapy according to ACC/AHA (American College for Cardiology/American Heart Association) 2013 guidelines.11 We will also target recruitment efforts to enrich for subjects with plasma TG concentration ≥ 150 mg/dL to ensure that we enroll subjects across the range of insulin sensitivity. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that high intensity atorvastatin treatment for approximately 10 weeks will impair insulin sensitivity and/or insulin secretion and that this effect may be exacerbated in those with underlying insulin resistance. 3. STUDY DESIGN Sample Size • We aim to recruit and retain 75 total participants in this study. Study Location • Clinical and Translational Research Unit (CTRU) at 800 Welch Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304. Duration • We anticipate that the entire study will take 4 - 5 years through the end of data analysis. Each eligible candidate who voluntarily consents to participate in the study will be active in the study for a total of 5 months from screening to the end of their last visit. 4. STUDY PROCEDURES Recruitment Preliminary recruitment strategies will include: Volunteers will be recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area through advertisements in newspapers, posted flyers, and the social networking site NextDoor as well as from the Preventive Cardiology Clinics at Stanford Health Care. Our goal is to ensure recruitment across a broad range of insulin sensitivity. Prior work from our group and others has shown that high plasma TG concentrations are associated with increased insulin resistance as assessed by reference measures. Therefore, we will target advertisements to enrich for individuals with high TG levels (\> 150 mg/dL) as a surrogate for increased insulin resistance. Participant Visits and Procedures Potential participants will be screened initially when they call or email in response to recruitment ads, or a letter from their MD, describing the study as follows: Preliminary intake will occur over the phone. Visit 1 Screening visit. Visit 2: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): This test will take approximately 3 hours. i) Glycemic status: Participants will be classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or combined IFG/IGT12. In addition, the total integrated plasma glucose response during the OGTT will be calculated by the trapezoidal method (Glucose-AUC). ii) β-cell function: Calculations of the Insulin Secretion- Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) will be used to quantify insulin secretory function 13, if for some reason a graded glucose infusion study is not done. The ISSI-2 is a validated OGTT- derived method to measure of β-cell function, analogous to the disposition index obtained from the intravenous glucose tolerance test 14. It is calculated by multiplying the insulin secretory response during the OGTT (Insulin-AUC/Glucose-AUC) by insulin resistance (Matsuda index). The fasting and 2-hour glucose results will be discussed with the study participant and a copy of the results will be given to them. Visit 3. Graded Glucose Infusion, GGIT 15,16: This test will take approximately 6 hours. This test is designed to assess the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin in response to a graded glucose infusion. During this test, subjects will have two small IV catheters placed, one in each arm. One IV will be used for drawing samples and the other for the infusion of glucose. During the GGIT, continuous intravenous infusions of glucose will be given at progressively increasing rates: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 kg/min in six infusion periods of 40-min duration. Blood samples will be collected for measurements of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations at fasting and at 30 min and 40 min into each infusion period. The two values during the last 10 min of each infusion period will be averaged. The amount of blood taken for this test will 47.5 ml. Visit 4.Insulin Suppression test, IST 17,18: This test will take approximately 6 hours. This test is designed to determine whole body insulin sensitivity. Following an overnight fast, subjects will have an IV placed in each arm. One for collection of blood and the other for infusion with octreotide (0.27 μg/m2/min), insulin (32 mU/m2/min), and glucose (267 mg/m2/min) for 180 minutes. During the test, endogenous insulin is suppressed and all individuals are given the same concentration of insulin, based on their body surface area. Blood is drawn every 30 minutes for 150 minutes and then at 10-minute intervals from 150 to 180 minutes of the infusion to measure plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. The mean of the last four values is used as the steady-state plasma insulin (SSPI) and glucose (SSPG) concentrations for each individual. As SSPI concentrations are similar in all subjects during the IST, the SSPG concentration provides a direct measure of the ability of insulin to mediate disposal of an infused glucose load; the higher the SSPG concentration, the more insulin resistant the individual. Labs to check kidney and liver function plus a lipid panel and a urine pregnancy test (if appropriate) will be done at this visit. Blood drawn or IST will be 58.5 ml and 5 ml for SHC labs. Labs for iPOP will be drawn at this time and additional samples will be obtained for transcriptome, microbiome, metabolome, and proteome analysis in blood; nasal, tongue, skin surface swabs; urine; and stool. The study drug, atorvastatin 40 mg will be given to study participants, once all labs have been reviewed and participant qualifies. Visit 5-7: Visits will be every 2 weeks for a total of 10 weeks on study medication (statin). Participants will be assessed for any side effects or adverse events (AE) on the statin. Adherence to study medication will be assessed at each visit. Visit 8: Weight, vital signs, and OGTT described above. Visit 9: Repeat GGIT as described above. Visit 10: Repeat IST and iPOP lab testing and samples as described above. At the end of this visit, the statin will be stopped and the study participant would be scheduled for 4- and 8-week follow up visits. Visit 11: One month off statin study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above. Visit 12: Last study visit - weight, vital signs, and iPOP laboratory testing and samples will be done as described above. Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaire about her/his physical activity status, food and eating habits, and stress at the time of each iPOP. 5.

The types of GI cancer being studied are cancers of the stomach, liver, pancreas, colon, and rectum. Researchers want to test a newly-designed questionnaire called the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Gastrointestinal (MDASI-GI) questionnaire.","Questionnaires:

If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete the MDASI-GI questionnaire on Day 1. It asks about any symptoms you may be experiencing, and how those symptoms may be interfering with your daily life. You will also complete two questionnaires that ask about the overall quality of your life. In total, these questionnaires should take about 20 minutes to complete.

You will then complete a questionnaire that asks for demographic information such as your age and marital status. It should take about 5 minutes.

You will receive another copy of the MDAS-GI questionnaire and the quality-of-life questionnaire to take home and complete 1 week later. The research staff will call you to remind you when it is time to complete this questionnaires. You should mail it back to the study staff in a stamped, pre-addressed envelope that will be provided to you.

Evaluation of Questionnaires:

Also on Day 1, a small group of participants (25 out of the 185 total participants) will complete an additional questionnaire called a ""cognitive debriefing"" questionnaire. These 25 participants will be the first 5 participants to join this study who have 1 of the 5 types of cancer being studied.

The questionnaire asks questions related to how easy it was for you to answer the questions on the MDASI-GI questionnaire, whether the questions relate to the symptoms you may be experiencing, and whether any other questions should be added. This questionnaire should take about 10 minutes to complete.

Interview:

Another small group of participants (a different 25 out of the 185 total) will have a one-on-one interview with a member of the study staff. During the interview, you will be asked to further describe the symptoms you may have experienced. This interview will be scheduled for a day when you are going to be at M. D.

Theoretically, the coatings provide excellent aesthetics throughout treatment and faster tooth alignment. However, from our clinical experience, these claims are the opposite. Cracks and ruptures as well as archwire fractures have been noted. Therefore, it is presumed that the aesthetic archwires may not be any different from the conventional uncoated archwires.","The development of superelastics nickel titanium (SE NiTi) has overcome problems with previous aligning archwires. This archwire is deemed to be the gold standard aligning archwire for Straight Wire® system due to its shape memory effect, high elasticity and low permanent deformation which delivers continuous force for orthodontic tooth alignment. The only drawbacks of this wire type are it is expensive, have high frictional resistance (Kapila et al., 1990) and is associated with hypersensitivity reaction in nickel allergic patients (Bass et al., 1993).

Development of teflon or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) which is anti-adherent and possesses aesthetic property had been used as orthodontic bracket, archwire and ligature coating. This polymer consists of synthetic fluorine-containing resin or epoxy resin composed mainly of polytetrafluoroethylyene to simulate tooth colour. The polymeric chain with good mechanical stability had been shown to reduce the frictional resistance between bracket-archwire interface and when used as archwire ligature (Farronato et al., 2012, De Franco et al., 1995). PTFE-coated brackets were reported to minimise the formation of biofilm during treatment which can reduce the risk of enamel decalcification (Demling et al., 2010). Furthermore, the coated aesthetic archwires have potential to obviate any allergic reaction during orthodontic treatment in patients with known hypersensitivity to nickel alloy.

Manufacturers have claimed that the aesthetic archwires available in the market have good color stability (remains unchanged for 6 to 8-week duration), good coating durability and low friction, allowing faster tooth movement. However, to our experience, these claims are the opposite.

As these aesthetic archwires are much more expensive than the conventional superelastic nickel titanium, it is therefore important to establish a clinical data to allow clinicians and patients to make a justifiable choice on treatment and develop further research in this area.","Inclusion Criteria:

This trial is a single-blind, randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia will be recruited according the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned into two groups. The total sample size will be 232, with 116 participants in the experimental group and 116 participants in the control group. A stratified block randomization method will be employed, using the ARISCAT score for PPCs risk assessment and individual study centers as stratification factors. Anesthesia routine will be applied during pre-anesthetic preparation, anesthetic induction, maintenance and emergence except intraoperative respiratory management. In the control group, fixed PEEP of 3 cmH2O is applied throughout the procedure without lung recruitment maneuvers. While in the experimental group (Pes-Guided Group), continuous monitoring of end-expiratory esophageal pressure (Pes) is conducted. PEEP is chosen to maintain a positive transpulmonary pressure at end-expiration (PL = PEEP - Pes) after lung recruitment. PEEP titration following lung recruitment should be performed after endotracheal intubation or any procedure that may cause lung collapse, such as pneumoperitoneum, deflation or inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff, changes in position, or endotracheal suctioning. PEEP Titration is also required every hour after the establishment of pneumoperitoneum. Patients will be followed up within 7 days after surgery to assess basic vital signs, potential postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). Additionally, postoperative non-respiratory complications will be evaluated. Laboratory tests, the 15-item Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) questionnaire, complications within 30 days after surgery, and 90-day survival rates will also be recorded. Inclusion Criteria: 1.

University of Michigan,OTHER,NCT00355784,Growth Hormone as a Determinant of Weight Regulation,Growth Hormone as a Determinant of Weight Regulation.,"With the alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity, identifying factors that predispose individuals to weight-gain is of critical importance. Even when caloric intake and physical activity levels are well controlled, susceptibility for weight-gain is heterogeneous. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) represents the largest portion of daily energy expenditure in normal adults, and as such, variability in BMR among individuals can be a major factor in determining the susceptibility for gaining weight. However, factors responsible for this variability in BMR and resistance to weight-gain remain unclear. Our preliminary data indicate that high-normal growth hormone (GH) concentration is associated with resistance to weight-gain in rats when overfed and greater weight-loss in humans when underfed. In addition, the investigators have found that the pulsatility of GH secretion has profound effects on several metabolic processes. Therefore, together these findings suggest that endogenous GH secretion is associated with body weight regulation, and the pulsatility (peak amplitude) of GH secretion, rather than the absolute GH concentration, per se, may be responsible for this effect. Because GH influences many of the key metabolic processes that contribute to BMR (e.g.; protein synthesis, proteolysis, substrate cycling), the investigators anticipate that the resistance to weight-gain in persons with elevated GH concentrations will be associated with an increase in BMR due to acceleration of some or all of these processes. Our overall hypothesis is that increased GH secretion can protect against weight-gain due to an augmentation of major metabolic processes that contribute to BMR. Identifying factors responsible for predisposing individuals to weight-gain will lead to establishing improved methods for reducing the prevalence of obesity.","The susceptibility to gain weight is highly variable even when caloric intake and physical activity are well controlled. Because basal metabolic rate (BMR) represents \~70% of total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), even a small difference in BMR can affect daily energy balance, thereby increasing the susceptibility for gaining weight. Our preliminary data indicate that high-normal growth hormone (GH) secretion is associated with resistance to weight-gain in rats when overfed and greater weight-loss in humans when underfed. Given that GH influences many of the key metabolic processes that contribute to BMR, the investigators hypothesize that persons with high-normal GH will be resistant to weight-gain because of a high BMR, resulting from accelerated rates of these processes. The investigators will measure basal 24h GH secretion and BMR in 106 non-obese men and women.

"National University Health System, Singapore",OTHER,NCT01974479,Pilot Study of Redirected Haploidentical Natural Killer Cell Infusions for B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,Pilot Study of Redirected Haploidentical Natural Killer Cell Infusions for B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Modern therapy for patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is based on intensive administration of multiple drugs. In patients with relapsed disease, treatment response is generally poor; for most patients, particularly those who relapse while still receiving frontline therapy, the only therapeutic option is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). There is no proven curative therapy for patients who relapse after transplant.

Natural killer (NK) cells have powerful anti-leukemia activity. In patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, several studies have demonstrated NK-mediated anti-leukemic activity. NK cell infusions in patients with leukemia have been shown to be well tolerated and void of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) effects.

NK cell cytotoxicity is most powerful against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, whereas their capacity to lyse ALL cells is generally low. We have developed a novel method to expand and redirect NK cells towards CD19, a molecule highly expressed on the surface of B-lineage ALL cells but not expressed on normal cells other than B-lymphocytes. In this method, donor NK cells are first expanded by co-culture with the cell line K562-mb15-41BBL and interleukin (IL)-2. Then, the expanded NK cells are transduced with a signaling receptor that binds to CD19 (anti-CD19-BB-zeta). NK cells expressing these receptors showed powerful anti-leukemic activity against CD19+ ALL cells in vitro and in an animal model of leukemia.

This study will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of infusing expanded, activated redirected NK cells into research participants with B-lineage ALL who have persistent disease after intensive chemotherapy . In this same cohort, we will study the in vivo lifespan and phenotype of these redirected NK cells.","1.0. Rationale

In contrast to the well-established cytotoxicity of NK cells against AML cells, their capacity to lyse ALL cells is generally low and difficult to predict. We sought to overcome this intrinsic resistance by transducing CD56+ CD3- NK cells with chimeric receptors directed against CD19, a molecule widely expressed by malignant B cells. Expression of anti-CD19 receptors linked to CD3zeta overcame NK resistance and markedly enhanced NK cell-mediated killing of leukemic cells. This result was significantly improved by adding the 4-1BB costimulatory molecule to the chimeric anti-CD19-CD3zeta receptor: the cytotoxicity produced by NK cells expressing this construct uniformly exceeded that of NK cells whose signaling receptors lacked 4-1BB, even when natural cytotoxicity was apparent (Imai et al., Blood 2005). NK cells expressing anti-CD19 receptors also exerted vigorous anti-ALL activity in a murine model of leukemia (Shimasaki et al., Cytotherapy 2012). Our findings indicate that enforced expression of signaling receptors by NK cells might circumvent inhibitory signals, providing a novel means to enhance the effectiveness of anti-ALL NK cell therapy.

The great anti-leukemic efficacy of genetically modified NK cells shown in our preclinical studies, together with the demonstrated feasibility of infusing durable haploidentical NK cells in a non-HSCT setting and the established expertise by the NUH team in cell therapy (the only center in Asia accredited by Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy, FACT), form a compelling rationale for the clinical testing of these NK cells.

The preparation of the key reagent (anti-CD19-BB-zeta mRNA) is finalized in the Tissue Engineering \& Cell Therapy (TECT) Laboratory at NUH, where the GMP-compliant MaxCyte electroporator is located. The feasibility of large-scale expansion of NK cells has been demonstrated (Shimasaki et al. Cytotherapy 2012), and the feasibility of large-scale electroporation validated in the TECT laboratory.

We will use flow cytometric and MRD technologies, to determine the presence of persistent disease , and will include in this study only patients with a limited amount of residual disease (\<1% leukemic lymphoblasts among normal bone marrow cells). We will use the same MRD methods to monitor the effects of treatment infusions. We do not expect that the conditioning regimen will have much effect by itself on leukemic cell counts, as the patients eligible for the study will have disease that is resistant to many anti-leukemic drugs. Nevertheless, because the conditioning regimen itself may have some salutary effects, it will be important to screen the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow for the presence of leukemic blast cells through all stages of the procedure, i.e., before, during, and after conditioning and after the NK cell infusion. The presence of leukemic cells in will be closely monitored by flow cytometry or PCR amplification of antigen-receptor genes (sensitivity for either method: 1 leukemic cell in 10,000) to shed some light on the relative effect of each intervention.

2.0. Hypothesis and Objectives

The main hypothesis to be tested in this study is that infusion of NK cells expressing anti-CD19-BB-zeta receptors by electroporation can produce measurable clinical responses in patients with resistant B-lineage ALL.

3.0. Primary Objectives

* To determine the feasibility and safety of redirecting NK cells with an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor by mRNA electroporation in a clinical setting.

5.0. Endpoints

In this study, treatment response will be measured by comparing MRD levels before and at several intervals after NK cell infusion.Achievement of MRD negativity in bone marrow, i.e., \< 0.01% blasts by flow cytometry or PCR, will be regarded as a complete response. Partial response will be defined as ≥ 1 log decrease in MRD levels, while \< 1 log decrease in MRD levels will be regarded as a no response.

Based on previous studies, donor NK cells will be eliminated in most cases by the resurgent cellular immunity of the haploidentical recipient after the effects of the transient immunosuppression caused by the conditioning regimen have ceased (typically within 1 month of infusion). Conceivably, however, NK cell engraftment may persist for a longer period with the possible risk of prolonged pancytopenia owing to NK cell killing on normal hematopoietic cells. Because of this possibility, we will plan for HSCT rescue in patients receiving redirected NK cell infusions. Indeed, for most of the patients eligible for this study, HSCT would be the treatment intervention regardless of whether they receive NK cell infusions or not. Because of these considerations, the potential benefits of NK cell therapy should outweigh its risks for those patients eligible for this study, i.e., patients with persistent leukemia for whom no other proven effective treatment is available.

Because CD19 is universally expressed on B cells including early B cell precursors, normal recipient B cell will also be a target for the donor NK cells transduced with the anti-CD19 chimeric receptors. Therefore, transient B-cell lymphopenia and hypogammaglobinemia are expected. We will monitor the CD19+ blood cell count and measure the Ig levels once a month and will give the participants intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) if their IgG level is lower than age-specific ranges.

6.0. Summary of Study Design

Peripheral blood cell will be collected by apheresis from donors. After ex vivo expansion for 10 days by coculture with irradiated K562-mb15-41BBL cells (Fujisaki et al, Cancer Res 2009; Lapteva et al. Cytotherapy 2012) and T-cell depletion, haploidentical NK cells will be electroporated with anti-CD19-BB-zeta mRNA. Before infusion, patients will receive immunosuppressive therapy to promote temporary engraftment of NK cells. After infusion, they will receive IL-2 to support NK cell viability and expansion in vivo. The effects of NK cell infusion will be determine by comparing MRD levels before and after treatment.

Receptor expression after electroporation is transient and typically declines after 48 hours becoming undetectable after 96 hours. Because the aim of NK cell therapy is not to induce durable immunity but to rapidly reduce tumor cell burden, and the infused NK cells are rejected by the host immune system after approximately 2 weeks of infusion, the transient nature of the expression should not significantly affect anti-tumor potential. Moreover, by using this strategy, safety concerns regarding insertional mutagenesis and long-term persistence of transduced residual T cells do not apply. In any case, we will minimize the number of residual T cells in the final product as much as possible by depleting the expanded product of T cells by using the CliniMACS device, and by limiting the number of T cells in the graft to \<0.05 x 10\^6/kg.","Inclusion Criteria:

In patients with relapsed disease, treatment response is generally poor; for most patients, particularly those who relapse while still receiving frontline therapy, the only therapeutic option is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). There is no proven curative therapy for patients who relapse after transplant. Natural killer (NK) cells have powerful anti-leukemia activity. In patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, several studies have demonstrated NK-mediated anti-leukemic activity. NK cell infusions in patients with leukemia have been shown to be well tolerated and void of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) effects. NK cell cytotoxicity is most powerful against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, whereas their capacity to lyse ALL cells is generally low. We have developed a novel method to expand and redirect NK cells towards CD19, a molecule highly expressed on the surface of B-lineage ALL cells but not expressed on normal cells other than B-lymphocytes. In this method, donor NK cells are first expanded by co-culture with the cell line K562-mb15-41BBL and interleukin (IL)-2. Then, the expanded NK cells are transduced with a signaling receptor that binds to CD19 (anti-CD19-BB-zeta). NK cells expressing these receptors showed powerful anti-leukemic activity against CD19+ ALL cells in vitro and in an animal model of leukemia. This study will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of infusing expanded, activated redirected NK cells into research participants with B-lineage ALL who have persistent disease after intensive chemotherapy . In this same cohort, we will study the in vivo lifespan and phenotype of these redirected NK cells. 1.0. Rationale In contrast to the well-established cytotoxicity of NK cells against AML cells, their capacity to lyse ALL cells is generally low and difficult to predict. We sought to overcome this intrinsic resistance by transducing CD56+ CD3- NK cells with chimeric receptors directed against CD19, a molecule widely expressed by malignant B cells. Expression of anti-CD19 receptors linked to CD3zeta overcame NK resistance and markedly enhanced NK cell-mediated killing of leukemic cells. This result was significantly improved by adding the 4-1BB costimulatory molecule to the chimeric anti-CD19-CD3zeta receptor: the cytotoxicity produced by NK cells expressing this construct uniformly exceeded that of NK cells whose signaling receptors lacked 4-1BB, even when natural cytotoxicity was apparent (Imai et al., Blood 2005). NK cells expressing anti-CD19 receptors also exerted vigorous anti-ALL activity in a murine model of leukemia (Shimasaki et al., Cytotherapy 2012). Our findings indicate that enforced expression of signaling receptors by NK cells might circumvent inhibitory signals, providing a novel means to enhance the effectiveness of anti-ALL NK cell therapy. The great anti-leukemic efficacy of genetically modified NK cells shown in our preclinical studies, together with the demonstrated feasibility of infusing durable haploidentical NK cells in a non-HSCT setting and the established expertise by the NUH team in cell therapy (the only center in Asia accredited by Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy, FACT), form a compelling rationale for the clinical testing of these NK cells. The preparation of the key reagent (anti-CD19-BB-zeta mRNA) is finalized in the Tissue Engineering \& Cell Therapy (TECT) Laboratory at NUH, where the GMP-compliant MaxCyte electroporator is located. The feasibility of large-scale expansion of NK cells has been demonstrated (Shimasaki et al. Cytotherapy 2012), and the feasibility of large-scale electroporation validated in the TECT laboratory. We will use flow cytometric and MRD technologies, to determine the presence of persistent disease , and will include in this study only patients with a limited amount of residual disease (\<1% leukemic lymphoblasts among normal bone marrow cells). We will use the same MRD methods to monitor the effects of treatment infusions. We do not expect that the conditioning regimen will have much effect by itself on leukemic cell counts, as the patients eligible for the study will have disease that is resistant to many anti-leukemic drugs. Nevertheless, because the conditioning regimen itself may have some salutary effects, it will be important to screen the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow for the presence of leukemic blast cells through all stages of the procedure, i.e., before, during, and after conditioning and after the NK cell infusion. The presence of leukemic cells in will be closely monitored by flow cytometry or PCR amplification of antigen-receptor genes (sensitivity for either method: 1 leukemic cell in 10,000) to shed some light on the relative effect of each intervention. 2.0.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,OTHER,NCT01852279,BCI and FES for Hand Therapy in Spinal Cord Injury,Brain Computer Interface Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation for a Hand Therapy in Tetraplegic Patients,This study will assess whether functional recovery of the hand muscles in patients with spinal cord injury is enhanced when electrical stimulation of the muscles is delivered actively by means of using the electroencephalography wave patterns arising from the patient imagining moving their hand to operate the stimulator. A control group will obtain the electrical stimulation treatment passively by a therapist operating the machine.,"Injuries of the higher levels of the spinal cord, called tetraplegia, result in a complete or partial paralysis of both legs and arms, making the person dependent on their caregivers for elementary activities of daily living (ADL) such as drinking and feeding. About 60% of tetraplegics have an incomplete injury and can partially recover their movement and sensation. The success of a recovery greatly depends on the therapy within the first year after the injury. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a relatively novel therapy of the hand. In FES therapy electrodes are attached on the surface the patients's forearms and electrical current is delivered through them. A disadvantage of the current FES therapy is that a therapist has to switch the stimulator on and off because patients cannot use either of their hands. In our previous pilot study performed on two acute tetraplegic patients we tested feasibility of using brain-computer interface (BCI) to control FES on patient's will. BCI is based on recording the patient's brain activity. BCI can detect the patient's intention to move the hand even if they are not able to physically move it. Using BCI, patients control the FES by thinking to move their hand.

A BCI-FES therapy will provide a simultaneous training of neural pathways from the brain to the hand muscle (motor imagination/attempt) and from the muscle to the brain (electrical stimulation of muscles). This form of therapy could promote faster and more complete recovery

In this controlled study we aim to provide a BCI-FES therapy to both chronic and subacute tetraplegic patients over a period of 20 sessions and to access the functional and neurological outcome of the therapy. Five chronic patients (more than a year after the injury) will participate in a cross-over study as we do not expect that they will recover spontaneously without BCI-FES. Subacute patients will be receiving both a conventional therapy and BCI-FES so recovery can be caused by either of these two therapies. Therefore it is necessary to have a treatment and a control group. Each group will have 10 patients, age and injury matched. Both groups will receive the same amount of electrical stimulation but only the treatment group will voluntarily control the electrical stimulator using BCI. A control group will receive passive electrical stimulation of the same hand muscles but without using BCI.","Inclusion Criteria:

The objective will be to maximise effective treatment for the patients in our large respiratory allergy clinic by using the screening tool to identify patients with OAS and advise them on the usual foods involved. A further objective will be to use the data to discover if there are any patterns of particular foods involved in OAS in UK sufferers.

Binge eating disorder (BED) is a new category in DSM-5 highly associated with higher body mass index (BMI).

These mechanisms demonstrated hyperactivity in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex and lack of regulatory influence from lateral prefrontal circuits. Several novel studies began to assess the potential benefits of brain stimulation in reducing craving and associated addictive behaviors with promising results. Previous findings testing a one-off session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in healthy women identified as strong cravers and individuals with bulimia nervosa or bulimic-type eating disorders reported reduction of food craving and BE, providing evidence to support a broader and deeper investigation of the benefits associated with rTMS. Importantly, the use of brain imaging studies contributes to the understanding of psychiatric disorders and underlying mechanisms being target by the rTMS intervention.

Objectives: The primary aim is to investigate the effects of rTMS over BE frequency. Secondary aims include the evaluation of the effects of rTMS on food craving, body weight, brain activity, cognition, general psychopathology, hormonal regulation and neurobiological markers. Methods: Sixty obese females with BED will be randomized to receive 20 sessions of rTMS (n=30) or placebo (n=30) scattered 3 days/week.

Acupuncture has been used for centuries for analgesia and quality of life improvement in addition to low cost. This study is a random control trial concerning the antiemetic efficacy of acupuncture associated with intravenous antiemetics in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in comparison to patients under only antiemetic administration.

One hundred patients were enrolled, regardless of their sex, age, and comorbidity and were randomly allocated in one of two groups. Both anesthesia and antiemetic medication were personalized according to each patient's medical history. In the study group, after anesthesia induction and before pneumoperitoneum application, a sterile stainless steel 0,25 x 25mm acupuncture needle was inserted bilaterally at the PC6 for 20 minutes, rotated manually clockwise and then anticlockwise every 5 minutes and then removed. Fisher's exact test was chosen for statistic evaluation.

There were 8 PONV cases in the study group against 18 cases in the control group. Fisher's exact test highlighted a p-value of P=0,03, marking the difference between the two groups as statistically significant.

Concluding, acupuncture presents a remarkable action against PONV after Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LPC). Another remarkable trait of acupuncture is the safety that it offers during application without provoking severe adverse effects. Furthermore, reduced medical costs thanks to decreased postoperative use of antiemetic medication, decreased patients' hospitalization, and reduced re-hospitalization possibility have to be noted.

Johns Hopkins University,OTHER,NCT02607384,The Baltimore Reading and Eye Disease Study,A School-based Intervention to Diagnose and Treat Vision Problems in Elementary School Children With Reading Difficulty,"The Baltimore Reading and Eye Disease Study (BREDS) is a two year study to determine the prevalence of vision problems in an early school age population with reading difficulty. Comprehensive vision and reading tests will be administered to 400 students at participating schools in the Baltimore City Public School system.

A secondary goal is to examine the impact of vision treatment on reading performance. Children with refractive error or convergence insufficiency will be provided treatment free of charge. The investigators will evaluate the impact that the treatment has on vision function and reading performance.","Learning to read is a fundamental skill taught in the early years of elementary school education. Students who experience difficulty reading are at risk for long-term struggles with academic achievement. In fact, achieving reading proficiency by the end of third grade has been established as key predictor of life success.

While a number of factors contribute to reading problems, an undiagnosed or untreated ocular condition may present one possible etiology. To the investigator's knowledge, there are no large scale or prospective studies evaluating the prevalence of vision disorders in children with reading difficulties. Previously, the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study performed visual assessments in the Baltimore area for children 6 months through 5 years of age to establish the prevalence of select ocular disorders in this pre-school population. Little is known about the types of vision problems that affect a grade school population with and without reading difficulty.

There is general consensus that undiagnosed or untreated vision problems may contribute to reading difficulty, although the extent to which treatment will improve reading performance is not well established. Although there are some studies demonstrating that treatment of vision problems can improve reading performance, publications on the efficacy of school-based interventions to identify and treat vision problems in school-age children are lacking. If successful, a school-based intervention could have significant impact improving reading performance, especially in high poverty neighborhoods where children have the highest risk of poor reading aptitude and limited access to eye care services.

The primary goal of this research study is to determine the prevalence of vision problems in an early school age population with reading difficulty. To adequately address this question, the investigators will administer reading and vision assessments to 400 second and third graders in participating schools within the Baltimore City Public School system. In addition, the investigators will obtain information on how many children with vision problems have received treatment in the past, and if not, why not. The investigators will also determine how schools handle and refer children who are felt to be poor readers in order to assist with planning future interventions.

This study will be conducted over a two-year period. In the first year, the investigators conducted baseline vision and reading assessment on all participating subjects. In the second year, the investigators will conduct follow up vision and reading assessments on all children treated with eyeglasses or eye exercises and a subset of subjects with healthy eye exams. The investigators plan to evaluate any barriers to interventions, and where possible assist in overcoming such barriers, for example by replacing lost/broken eyeglasses.

A secondary goal is to examine the impact of vision treatment on reading performance. Children with refractive error and convergence insufficiency will be provided treatment free of charge. The investigators will evaluate the impact that the treatment has on vision function and reading performance.

In subsequent phases of this project, the investigators also hope to learn how novel treatments (e.g. iPads) impact reading performance.","Inclusion Criteria:

Comprehensive vision and reading tests will be administered to 400 students at participating schools in the Baltimore City Public School system. A secondary goal is to examine the impact of vision treatment on reading performance. Children with refractive error or convergence insufficiency will be provided treatment free of charge. The investigators will evaluate the impact that the treatment has on vision function and reading performance. Learning to read is a fundamental skill taught in the early years of elementary school education. Students who experience difficulty reading are at risk for long-term struggles with academic achievement. In fact, achieving reading proficiency by the end of third grade has been established as key predictor of life success. While a number of factors contribute to reading problems, an undiagnosed or untreated ocular condition may present one possible etiology. To the investigator's knowledge, there are no large scale or prospective studies evaluating the prevalence of vision disorders in children with reading difficulties. Previously, the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study performed visual assessments in the Baltimore area for children 6 months through 5 years of age to establish the prevalence of select ocular disorders in this pre-school population. Little is known about the types of vision problems that affect a grade school population with and without reading difficulty. There is general consensus that undiagnosed or untreated vision problems may contribute to reading difficulty, although the extent to which treatment will improve reading performance is not well established. Although there are some studies demonstrating that treatment of vision problems can improve reading performance, publications on the efficacy of school-based interventions to identify and treat vision problems in school-age children are lacking. If successful, a school-based intervention could have significant impact improving reading performance, especially in high poverty neighborhoods where children have the highest risk of poor reading aptitude and limited access to eye care services. The primary goal of this research study is to determine the prevalence of vision problems in an early school age population with reading difficulty. To adequately address this question, the investigators will administer reading and vision assessments to 400 second and third graders in participating schools within the Baltimore City Public School system. In addition, the investigators will obtain information on how many children with vision problems have received treatment in the past, and if not, why not. The investigators will also determine how schools handle and refer children who are felt to be poor readers in order to assist with planning future interventions. This study will be conducted over a two-year period. In the first year, the investigators conducted baseline vision and reading assessment on all participating subjects. In the second year, the investigators will conduct follow up vision and reading assessments on all children treated with eyeglasses or eye exercises and a subset of subjects with healthy eye exams. The investigators plan to evaluate any barriers to interventions, and where possible assist in overcoming such barriers, for example by replacing lost/broken eyeglasses. A secondary goal is to examine the impact of vision treatment on reading performance. Children with refractive error and convergence insufficiency will be provided treatment free of charge. The investigators will evaluate the impact that the treatment has on vision function and reading performance. In subsequent phases of this project, the investigators also hope to learn how novel treatments (e.g. iPads) impact reading performance.

Pharmasset,INDUSTRY,NCT00121979,Study Comparing Racivir and Lamivudine in Treatment-Experienced HIV Subjects,"Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study Exploring the Safety, Tolerability, and Antiviral Effect of Substituting 600 mg Racivir for 3TC in HIV-Infected Subjects Who Have the M184V Mutation and Are Currently Failing on a HAART Regimen Containing Lamivudine","Racivir ® (RCV) is an experimental drug which means it is not approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but it can be used in research studies like this one. RCV (Racivir®) is part of a class of drugs known as ""Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors"" (NRTIs), which are intended to block a further increase in the amount of HIV virus in the body. Laboratory research suggests that RCV (Racivir®) may be effective in patients who have developed resistance to other NRTIs, particularly 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®). However, a study of RCV (Racivir®) has not been done with patients who have previously been treated with other HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy -- taking multiple HIV drugs at once) medications including 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RCV (Racivir®) when used together with other HIV drugs in people who have previously been treated with 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®) and are failing with their current HAART treatments. This study will include a total of 60 HIV infected, HAART-experienced subjects currently receiving 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®) as part of their HAART therapy. The study will take place at approximately 11 study sites in the US and Latin America.","The study is divided into four periods: a 'Screening' period which can last up to 30 days in duration, a 'Blinded Treatment' period which can last up to 4 weeks in duration, a 'Follow-up' period which is 28 days in duration, and an 'Open-label Treatment' period that some subjects will be given the option to participate in and which can last up to 20 weeks.

If eligible subjects decide to participate in this research study, they will be randomized, which is like picking chances from a hat, to get RCV (Racivir®) alone, 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®) alone, or RCV and 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®) in combination. This is a ""double-blind study"". This means that neither the subject nor the study doctor and study staff will know if subjects are receiving RCV (Racivir®), 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®), or RCV (Racivir®) and 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®). This needs to be done to make sure the researchers obtain the information needed to see if RCV (Racivir®) is safe and as effective as 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®). In case of an emergency, the study doctor will be able to find out immediately what study drug subjects were receiving. With this exception, by signing the consent form subjects agree that they will not be able to find out what medications they are taking, because this is a ""double-blind"" study, it is necessary to use placebo tablets. A placebo is a tablet that does not contain any active drug, but is made to look just like the study drug.

Subjects will be given three bottles of study medication. They will be asked to take one tablet from each bottle once a day by mouth, in addition to their current HAART drugs, not including 3TC. The 3TC in their current HAART regimen must be discontinued prior to beginning the study medication. It is important that subjects follow all directions when taking the study drugs.

After completing the first 14 days of the blinded treatment period, subjects will be given the option to continue on their current randomized therapy, including their current study medication, for an additional 1-2 weeks. On Day 15, a blood sample will be collected to determine the amount of HIV virus in the blood. Once the results from that blood sample are available, subjects will be told the amount of how much HIV virus changed in the blood during the first 14 days of treatment. Subjects will also be told if they were receiving RCV (Racivir®) alone, 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®) alone, or a combination of RCV (Racivir®) and 3TC (lamivudine, Epivir®).

If subjects were receiving RCV (Racivir®), to continue in the open-label treatment period, the amount of virus in the blood must drop by at least 2/3 during the first 14 days of the blinded treatment period. For example, if subjects enter the study with 10,000 copies of the HIV virus per milliliter (ml) of blood, then to continue in the open-label period, the virus level must drop to 3,162 copies or less, per ml of blood. Open-label means that participating subjects and the study doctor or study staff will know what treatment subjects were receiving.

If the virus drops by at least 2/3, subjects will be given the option to enter an open-label treatment period. During the open-label period, subjects will receive 600 mg RCV (Racivir®) once daily along with their regular HAART medications. Before entering the open-label period, the study doctor may decide to change the subject's other ARV medications. Participating subjects will be financially responsible for all medications, other than RCV (Racivir®), that the study doctor may prescribe.

Once treatment is ""unblinded"", subjects may learn that they were not receiving any RCV (Racivir®) during the blinded treatment period. Subjects may voluntarily decide to add 600 mg RCV (Racivir®) once daily to the other HAART medications. The study doctor may decide to change the subject's HAART medications at this time. After 2 weeks of RCV (Racivir®) based treatment, subjects will be asked to return to the study doctor's office to have blood drawn to determine the amount of HIV virus in the blood. Subjects may continue on RCV (Racivir®) for up to an additional 2 weeks until the results from the blood test are available. If the viral load does not decline by at least 2/3, subjects will be withdrawn from the open-label portion of the study. Subjects will be asked to return to the study doctor's office for a final follow-up visit approximately 28 days after the last dose of RCV (Racivir®).

The open-label treatment period will last no longer than 20 weeks. During this study, subjects can receive up to 24 weeks of RCV (Racivir®) therapy. After subjects receive the last dose of study medication, they will enter the follow-up period for 28 days.

If a participating subject or the study doctor decides to withdraw from the study early, subjects will need to return to the study doctor's office to have a follow-up visit approximately 28 days after the last dose of RCV (Racivir®).","Inclusion Criteria:

For that reason the current study, ADVANCE, is designed to structurally collect data on the daily practice use of bortezomib as treatment after first relapse in patients with specific and well defined first line treatments (i.e. patients who participated in the HOVON-49 or HOVON-50 study). In both HOVON studies patients were randomized to either receiving thalidomide or not, as a part of the first line treatment. Therefore, the effect of pre-treatment with thalidomide on duration, effectiveness and safety of the bortezomib treatment after first relapse can be studied specifically. The analysis of this particular type of data will, however, be descriptive. All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to bortezomib therapy will be recorded on the case report form, i.e., a form for each patient in the study on which all needed data are recorded, and reported to the sponsor within current timelines. The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory authorities. This project is a 'post authorization study (PAS)'. This means that only routinely available medical data are collected, with the patients' permission, and no additional interventions or diagnostic procedures should be done specifically for this study. Because the study is observational, dosage, administration and duration of treatment is at discretion of the treating physician","Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients have to sign a statement that they agree with collection of their clinical data for this project

An Observational Study To Determine Velcade (Bortezomib) Safety and Effectiveness at First Relapse After Participation In First Line HOVON-49/50 Clinical Studies (ADVANCE) The primary aim of this observational study is to collect safety and effectiveness data for bortezomib used at first relapse in a group of multiple myeloma patients who received specific and well defined first line treatments within previous clinical studies. There is a need by physicians to evaluate the results of bortezomib treatment in a homogenous patient population with regard to the multiple myeloma treatments in first line. For that reason the current study, ADVANCE, is designed to structurally collect data on the daily practice use of bortezomib as treatment after first relapse in patients with specific and well defined first line treatments (i.e. patients who participated in the HOVON-49 or HOVON-50 study). In both HOVON studies patients were randomized to either receiving thalidomide or not, as a part of the first line treatment. Therefore, the effect of pre-treatment with thalidomide on duration, effectiveness and safety of the bortezomib treatment after first relapse can be studied specifically. The analysis of this particular type of data will, however, be descriptive. All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to bortezomib therapy will be recorded on the case report form, i.e., a form for each patient in the study on which all needed data are recorded, and reported to the sponsor within current timelines. The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory authorities. This project is a 'post authorization study (PAS)'. This means that only routinely available medical data are collected, with the patients' permission, and no additional interventions or diagnostic procedures should be done specifically for this study. Because the study is observational, dosage, administration and duration of treatment is at discretion of the treating physician Inclusion Criteria: * Patients have to sign a statement that they agree with collection of their clinical data for this project * patients had a first relapse or progressive disease after treatment in the HOVON-49 or HOVON-50 study and will be treated with bortezomib.

Stanford University,OTHER,NCT00285779,Use of Etanercept in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Lichen Planus,"A Double-Blind, Randomized, Multicenter Pilot Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Etanercept 50mg SC Twice Weekly in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Lichen Planus","The purpose is to assess the response of subjects to etanercept (as compared to placebo) in treating the physical signs of mucosal and cutaneous lichen planus. The investigators also wish to assess the effect of etanercept on disease-related itching, pain, and serious adverse events in patients with lichen planus.","Lichen planus affects up to 1% of the worldwide population. Recent estimates suggest approximately 0.44% of the US population suffers from this disease. Oral or genital involvement occurs in 60-70% of patients, and it may be the sole manifestation of disease in 20-30% of patients.

Lichen planus is a mucocutaneous disorder that can involve the skin, oral or genital mucosa, conjunctiva, and nails. On the skin, the disease presents as multiple papules, which can be localized or generalized, that are often extremely itchy. Mucosal disease can consist of either asymptomatic plaques or extremely painful erosive lesions. The disease course is unpredictable and typically lasts 1-2 years but can follow a chronic, relapsing course. Erosive mucosal disease is important to aggressively treat for many reasons: First, the associated pain can be debilitating for the patient. Patients with severe oral lichen planus can become malnourished due to pain associated with eating. Vulvar disease can cause dyspareunia, burning pain, and discharge; second, the disease tends to be chronic, with little chance for self-resolution; third, erosive disease is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in the affected areas. These cancers occur in up to 1% of patients over a 3-year period, and they can be aggressive and even-life threatening for the patient if not recognized and treated early.

Several lines of evidence suggest that TNF-alpha plays a role in the pathogenesis of lichen planus. It has been shown that there are increased levels of TNF-alpha in the serum of these patients. In addition, skin and mucosal biopsies show increased TNF-alpha produced by the infiltrating lymphocytes as well as the basal keratinocytes. It has been suggested that the expression of TNF-alpha receptor on the basal keratinocytes may contribute to apoptosis. Also, TNFR1 (a TNF-alpha receptor) is expressed by the infiltrating mononuclear cells as well as the keratinocytes. Increased levels of soluble TNF receptors are also found in the serum of patients with lichen planus. A recent report also has shown that polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha gene are associated with both oral and cutaneous lichen planus. Finally, thalidomide, which partly functions as a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha transcription, has been shown to be effective (in small case series and reports) in selected patients for the treatment of oral and genital lichen planus. However, thalidomide is a potent teratogen and cannot be used in women of childbearing potential. In addition, thalidomide usage not uncommonly results in neurotoxicity, which can be permanent, and thus limits use of this drug. Despite the evidence for a role of TNF-alpha in LP there are no reports of any TNF inhibitors being used for this disease.

This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to observe the safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with lichen planus.

This study will consist of 3 periods: first, a double-blind period (weeks 0-12) in which subjects will be randomized to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly or placebo; second, an open-label period (weeks 12-24) in which subjects who were randomized to placebo treatment, who have not achieved a complete remission, will be rolled over to use etanercept at 50 mg twice weekly. Subjects who previously received etanercept during weeks 0-12, who have not achieved a complete remission, will be continued on etanercept at a lower dosage of 25 mg twice weekly for weeks 12-24; third, an 8 week follow-up period for all subjects.","Inclusion Criteria:

Finally, thalidomide, which partly functions as a potent inhibitor of TNF-alpha transcription, has been shown to be effective (in small case series and reports) in selected patients for the treatment of oral and genital lichen planus. However, thalidomide is a potent teratogen and cannot be used in women of childbearing potential. In addition, thalidomide usage not uncommonly results in neurotoxicity, which can be permanent, and thus limits use of this drug. Despite the evidence for a role of TNF-alpha in LP there are no reports of any TNF inhibitors being used for this disease. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to observe the safety and efficacy of etanercept in patients with lichen planus. This study will consist of 3 periods: first, a double-blind period (weeks 0-12) in which subjects will be randomized to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly or placebo; second, an open-label period (weeks 12-24) in which subjects who were randomized to placebo treatment, who have not achieved a complete remission, will be rolled over to use etanercept at 50 mg twice weekly. Subjects who previously received etanercept during weeks 0-12, who have not achieved a complete remission, will be continued on etanercept at a lower dosage of 25 mg twice weekly for weeks 12-24; third, an 8 week follow-up period for all subjects.

Hadassah Medical Organization,OTHER,NCT03063684,Fractional / Pixel CO2 Laser Treatment of Vulvar Atrophy and Lichen Sclerosus,Fractional / Pixel CO2 Laser Treatment of Vulvar Atrophy and Lichen Sclerosus,"The study will examine the effects of fractional/pixel CO2 laser treatment in vaginal atrophy and in vulvar lichen sclerosus by means of histological and immuno-histochemical characterization of the epithelial layers and markers of tissue aging. The tissue characterization will be performed by biopsies of the vaginal or vulvar tissue at three different points of time: prior to treatment, two weeks after the third and last treatment, and one year after the last treatment.","Many studies have been published recently describing the use of a fractional/pixel CO2 laser for the treatment of various disorders of the vulva and the vagina, such as atrophy due to estrogen deficiency, urinary stress incontinence, skin diseases (lichen sclerosus) and more.

The results of the studies that investigated this technology in relation to vaginal atrophy and urinary stress incontinence have shown improvement in symptoms after a series of only 3 treatments.

The proposed effect of the fractional CO2 laser is based on studies performed on non-genital tissues \[Daffon, Capon\], which demonstrated changes in the connective tissue and proliferation of fibroblasts, as well as formation of collagen and elastic fibers. The suggested explanation is based on the theory that heat shock proteins are involved in the process and arise due to thermal tissue damage, and this in turn activate tissue cytokines, growth factors and fibroblasts. These theories have not been proven for vulvar and vaginal tissues, and except for the demonstration of histologic and morphologic changes in the irradiated tissues \[Salvatore, Menopause 2015\], the cellular mechanism of action and the nature of the process mediating the changes in uro-genital tissues has not yet been examined.

The technology known as fractional CO2 has been used for many years in dermatology and plastic surgery. In this method, the laser beam splits while passing through a lens to 81 dots (9 x 9 pixels) onto approximately 1 cm2. The laser beam penetrates the tissue and causes minimal evaporation around each spot of the fractionated beams and release of heat only at the desired tissue depth. The method of energy transfer to tissues in tiny dots leads to the creation of various thermal effects in the focus of the beam, around the focus, and in the areas between these heat foci. Following the tissue irradiation, different processes occur: epithelial cell proliferation and thickening of the epithelial layer, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, creation of neo-vasculature in the lamina propria, creation of collagen and elastic fibers, and accumulation of glycogen in the cells \[Salvatore, Menopause 2015\]. The result of these processes is improved tissue elasticity and plasticity as well as regeneration of the epidermis layer. Previous studies demonstrated that the effect of this treatment on the atrophic vagina is identical to long-term local estrogen treatment, with improved cytological index, improved lubrication, alteration of the vaginal flora, and reduced acidity to the level of ""estrogenic"" levels (approx. pH 4 -4.5) \[Salvatore, Menopause, 2015;Perino; Gasper; Salvatore, Climacteric, 2015\].

Considering the multitude of recently published articles presenting impressive clinical results, the investigators decided to examine the effects of the treatment with a fractional CO2 laser on the vaginal and vulvar tissue at a cellular level for two conditions: vaginal atrophy due to estrogen deficiency and lichen sclerosus. These two conditions were chosen due to the magnitude of recent publications dealing with clinical and histological improvement in these two pathological conditions following laser treatment. Understanding the cytological processes will enable the foundation of knowledge about the basic mechanism of action, and propose methods to improve the current therapeutic protocols. It will also enable the observation of the duration of the treatment effect, and the assessment of whether these changes are associated with undesired events, such as increased risk of malignant tissue transformation.

Patients The investigators intend to recruit 10 women for each group (10 women with atrophy and 10 with lichen sclerosus). Considering the availability of efficient and safe medical treatment, most women diagnosed with lichen sclerosus or vaginal atrophy are treated with medical preparations to their satisfaction. Therefore, the investigators will recruit the following types of patients for the trial: women with low compliance for the medical treatment, women who have developed intolerance to the treatment (such as chronic candida vulvovaginitis under long-term estrogen treatment, hypersensitivity reactions to the steroid ointment or estrogen preparation, or drug allergy) or women with only partial response to treatment, for whom there is no satisfactory therapeutic alternative.

The study includes 6 appointments:

T0-recruitment: ascertain eligibility, sign informed consent form, complete a questionnaire including epidemiologic and clinical details, gynecological examination, cytological smear (maturation index), determination of the acidity level of the vaginal secretions (pH), determination of vaginal health index score \[Bachmann\].

A punch biopsy will be taken from the mid-third of the vagina (in vaginal atrophy) or the vulva (in lichen sclerosus).

T1-Visit 2 (2-4 weeks from recruitment) The treatment protocol includes a series of three laser treatments, 4-6 weeks apart.

The first laser treatment will be performed during Visit 2. In the vagina, the treatment is performed by a special vaginal transducer enabling 360° treatment; the irradiation of the vagina is performed in adjacent ""squares"" along the entire vaginal circumference, by turning the handle while slowly withdrawing the transducer from the vaginal canal. The duration of treatment is 5-7 minutes. The vaginal treatment is not associated with pain. The treatment of the introitus will be performed by a transducer enabling treatment around 360° named FemiLift.

The treatment will be performed by a fractional micro-ablative CO2 laser system manufactured by Alma Laser in accordance with the accepted protocol (laser mode: pulse, energy: 40-80 mj/pulse).

For lichen sclerosus, a handgrip of the FemiLift transducer will be used, which transmits the ""pixel print"" directly and not under a 90° angle. Since the vulvar skin is pain sensitive, it will be treated prior to the laser application, with EMLA anesthetic cream. The duration of treatment is 3-7 minutes and it is performed by the same device with energy levels of 20-60 mj/pulse.

During Visit 3 (T2) and Visit 4 (T3), identical treatment to that described above will be performed.

In the framework of the study, the below follow-up procedures will be performed:

1. Biopsy - three biopsies will be taken from the lateral mid-third of the vagina: prior to treatment (T0), two weeks after the third and final treatment (T4) and one year after the completion of the treatment series (T5). The biopsy will be a punch biopsy with a 5 mm diameter. The biopsies will be performed under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine.
2. In the course of each of the follow-up examinations (T 0 - 5), the following will be performed (In vaginal atrophy):

   * Gynecological examination with speculum
   * Smear taken from the mid-third of the vagina with a cotton tip applicator, which will be used for a cytological smear and to determine the acidity level of the vaginal secretions.
   * The vaginal health index score will be determined, including the evaluation of 5 parameters: elasticity, pH, integrity of the epithelium, moisture and fluid volume. Each parameter is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, and if the total score is lower than 15, the vagina is considered atrophic \[Bachmann\].
   * The patient will be requested to grade symptoms (dryness, itching, burning, discomfort, dyspareunia, dysuria) on a VAS (visual analog scale) with ""very disturbing"" and ""not disturbing at all"" at its limits.
   * The patient will be requested to grade the extent of her satisfaction with the treatment results (very satisfied. satisfied, not sure, not satisfied, very unsatisfied).
   * The patient will be requested to report side effects.

In lichen sclerosus patients:

- External examination of the vulva and a photograph of the results for follow-up.

The biopsies will be sent to the Institute of Pathology at Hadassah Hospital, where the following examinations will be performed:

1. Routine hematoxylin-eosin staining.
2. Immunohistochemistry staining for P16 protein.
3. Immunohistochemistry staining for the KI-67 protein.
4. Immunohistochemistry staining for the p63 protein,\\.
5. Staining for alpha and beta estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors.","Vaginal Atrophy - Inclusion Criteria

The tissue characterization will be performed by biopsies of the vaginal or vulvar tissue at three different points of time: prior to treatment, two weeks after the third and last treatment, and one year after the last treatment. Many studies have been published recently describing the use of a fractional/pixel CO2 laser for the treatment of various disorders of the vulva and the vagina, such as atrophy due to estrogen deficiency, urinary stress incontinence, skin diseases (lichen sclerosus) and more. The results of the studies that investigated this technology in relation to vaginal atrophy and urinary stress incontinence have shown improvement in symptoms after a series of only 3 treatments. The proposed effect of the fractional CO2 laser is based on studies performed on non-genital tissues \[Daffon, Capon\], which demonstrated changes in the connective tissue and proliferation of fibroblasts, as well as formation of collagen and elastic fibers. The suggested explanation is based on the theory that heat shock proteins are involved in the process and arise due to thermal tissue damage, and this in turn activate tissue cytokines, growth factors and fibroblasts. These theories have not been proven for vulvar and vaginal tissues, and except for the demonstration of histologic and morphologic changes in the irradiated tissues \[Salvatore, Menopause 2015\], the cellular mechanism of action and the nature of the process mediating the changes in uro-genital tissues has not yet been examined. The technology known as fractional CO2 has been used for many years in dermatology and plastic surgery. In this method, the laser beam splits while passing through a lens to 81 dots (9 x 9 pixels) onto approximately 1 cm2. The laser beam penetrates the tissue and causes minimal evaporation around each spot of the fractionated beams and release of heat only at the desired tissue depth. The method of energy transfer to tissues in tiny dots leads to the creation of various thermal effects in the focus of the beam, around the focus, and in the areas between these heat foci. Following the tissue irradiation, different processes occur: epithelial cell proliferation and thickening of the epithelial layer, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, creation of neo-vasculature in the lamina propria, creation of collagen and elastic fibers, and accumulation of glycogen in the cells \[Salvatore, Menopause 2015\]. The result of these processes is improved tissue elasticity and plasticity as well as regeneration of the epidermis layer. Previous studies demonstrated that the effect of this treatment on the atrophic vagina is identical to long-term local estrogen treatment, with improved cytological index, improved lubrication, alteration of the vaginal flora, and reduced acidity to the level of ""estrogenic"" levels (approx. pH 4 -4.5) \[Salvatore, Menopause, 2015;Perino; Gasper; Salvatore, Climacteric, 2015\]. Considering the multitude of recently published articles presenting impressive clinical results, the investigators decided to examine the effects of the treatment with a fractional CO2 laser on the vaginal and vulvar tissue at a cellular level for two conditions: vaginal atrophy due to estrogen deficiency and lichen sclerosus. These two conditions were chosen due to the magnitude of recent publications dealing with clinical and histological improvement in these two pathological conditions following laser treatment. Understanding the cytological processes will enable the foundation of knowledge about the basic mechanism of action, and propose methods to improve the current therapeutic protocols.

The recommendations for its use were described in the ESC guideline for ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death. To visualize the arrhythmogenic substrate leading to ventricular tachycardia complex mapping techniques are currently used in clinical routine, including conventional Point-by-Point mapping or Multielectrode Mapping. The latter is associated with shorter Mapping and overall procedure times, while maintaining the same primary endpoint of the procedure itself. The aim of this trial is to validate, whether the reduction of mapping and procedure time is associated with a comparable long-term outcome compared with conventional Point-by-Point mapping.","Catheter Ablation in Patient with VT and ischemic heart disease has shown a beneficial effect in terms of VT Recurrence and Quality of life. The short-term outcome of catheter Ablation in Patients with this particular disease is good, but VT recurrence during long-term follow up is as high as 50-70%.

An integral Part of the Ablation procedure is the substance guided Mapping for localisation of low Voltage areas, late diastolic or fractioned potentials, as possible substrate for VT maintenance. These diastolic pathways, which represent slow conducting myocardium, are the major prerequisites for Reentry and thus for ventricular tachycardia.

Commonly these diastolic pathways are found in myocardial scar after infarction. Cardiac MRI can help to visualize these scars. In Patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, the physician has to rely on intraprocedural Mapping and localisation of pathologic signals mentioned above.

In the last few years, the use of Multielectrode Mapping catheters becomes more and more part of complex EP procedures, mainly due to a high spatio temporal resolution, thereby reducing the overall Mapping time while maintaining the same primary endpoint of VT-non-inducibility compared to Point-by-Point Mapping.

There is growing evidence, that Multielectrode Mapping is associated with lesser mapping and procedure time, while generating more elecatroanatomical points (and thus more information regarding the arrhythmogenic substrate, responsible for VT maintenance).

Currently there is considerable uncertainty as to whether the reduced mapping and procedure time of Multielectrode Mapping will have an effect on the recurrence of ventricular tachycardia.

Procedure time of catheter ablation in patients with scar mediated ventricular tachycardia is directly correlated to hospital mortality.

Yet there are no prospective studies, which evaluate the effect of the aforementioned Mapping systems in the recurrence of ventricular tachycardia in comparison to conventional mapping techniques.

Penn State University,OTHER,NCT00219479,Dilantin Levels With Continuous Delivery of Enteral Feedings - A Pilot Study,Dilantin Levels With Continuous Delivery of Enteral Feedings - A Pilot Study,"It is unclear how enteral nutrition via a feeding tube should be given when a patient is receiving enteral Dilantin. Some caregivers hold the feedings for one hour before and one hour after the Dilantin dose to insure adequate absorption of the medication and some caregivers think that the feedings do not need to be interrupted.

Hypothesis: Dilantin levels will remain therapeutic when enteral nutrition is given continuously during the administration of enteral Dilantin.

The objective of this study is to determine Dilantin levels when enteral feedings are given by the continuous method. Thirty patients will be studied. When Dilantin levels are in the therapeutic range for 2 consecutive days on interrupted feedings (baseline), the patient will be switched to continuous feedings uninterrupted for the medication, for 7 days. Dilantin levels will be checked daily and if the levels become subtherapeutic an intravenous (IV) bolus of Dilantin will be given and the enteral dose will be increased (doses determined by primary caregiver). Serum albumin will be measured at baseline and at the beginning and end of each week, in order to calculate free Dilantin.","Rationale: It is unclear how enteral nutrition via feeding tube should be given when a patient is receiving enteral Dilantin. Some caregivers hold the feedings for one hour before and one hour after the Dilantin dose to insure adequate absorption of the medication and some caregivers think that the feedings do not need to be interrupted. Both methods are used in this institution, although the interrupted method is recommended by the Clinical Nutrition Service. Interrupting the feedings has the obvious disadvantage that the patient receives less hours of feeding and requires more nursing intervention.

Key Objectives: To determine the change in Dilantin levels when enteral feedings are given by the continuous method.

Study Population: 30 patients already on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis who are already receiving enteral nutrition by the interrupted method and have stable, therapeutic Dilantin levels.

Major Inclusion Criteria:

1. on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis (dose determined by primary caregiver) with therapeutic Dilantin levels
2. receiving enteral nutrition by the interrupted method at goal feeding rate;
3. age \>18
4. feeding tube in proper position, no restriction as to type of feeding tube (nasogastric, nasoduodenal, gastrostomy, jejunostomy), but both Dilantin and enteral feeding must be given through the same tube.

Major Exclusion Criteria:

1. history of seizures
2. albumin infusions necessary during study period
3. anticipation that feedings will need to be held for more than 4 hours at a time
4. Patients that do not maintain stable Dilantin levels (\< 25% variability) with the interrupted method of feeding; 5) inability to obtain consent from patient or spokesperson.

Allocation to Groups: all patients will be switched from baseline method of feeding (interrupted) to continuous feeding.

Procedures: When Dilantin levels are in the therapeutic range for 2 consecutive days on interrupted feedings (baseline), the patient will be switched to continuous feedings uninterrupted for the medication, for 7 days. Dilantin levels will be checked daily and if the levels become subtherapeutic an IV bolus of Dilantin will be given and the enteral dose will be increased (doses determined by primary caregiver). Serum albumin will be measured at baseline and at the beginning and end of each week, in order to calculate free Dilantin.

Risks and Discomforts:

1. subtherapeutic Dilantin levels, but these will be closely followed;

Some caregivers hold the feedings for one hour before and one hour after the Dilantin dose to insure adequate absorption of the medication and some caregivers think that the feedings do not need to be interrupted. Hypothesis: Dilantin levels will remain therapeutic when enteral nutrition is given continuously during the administration of enteral Dilantin. The objective of this study is to determine Dilantin levels when enteral feedings are given by the continuous method. Thirty patients will be studied. When Dilantin levels are in the therapeutic range for 2 consecutive days on interrupted feedings (baseline), the patient will be switched to continuous feedings uninterrupted for the medication, for 7 days. Dilantin levels will be checked daily and if the levels become subtherapeutic an intravenous (IV) bolus of Dilantin will be given and the enteral dose will be increased (doses determined by primary caregiver). Serum albumin will be measured at baseline and at the beginning and end of each week, in order to calculate free Dilantin. Rationale: It is unclear how enteral nutrition via feeding tube should be given when a patient is receiving enteral Dilantin. Some caregivers hold the feedings for one hour before and one hour after the Dilantin dose to insure adequate absorption of the medication and some caregivers think that the feedings do not need to be interrupted. Both methods are used in this institution, although the interrupted method is recommended by the Clinical Nutrition Service. Interrupting the feedings has the obvious disadvantage that the patient receives less hours of feeding and requires more nursing intervention. Key Objectives: To determine the change in Dilantin levels when enteral feedings are given by the continuous method. Study Population: 30 patients already on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis who are already receiving enteral nutrition by the interrupted method and have stable, therapeutic Dilantin levels.

Patients that do not maintain stable Dilantin levels (\< 25% variability) with the interrupted method of feeding; 5) inability to obtain consent from patient or spokesperson. Allocation to Groups: all patients will be switched from baseline method of feeding (interrupted) to continuous feeding. Procedures: When Dilantin levels are in the therapeutic range for 2 consecutive days on interrupted feedings (baseline), the patient will be switched to continuous feedings uninterrupted for the medication, for 7 days. Dilantin levels will be checked daily and if the levels become subtherapeutic an IV bolus of Dilantin will be given and the enteral dose will be increased (doses determined by primary caregiver).

This study hypothesizes that high-amylose rice, will decrease blood glucose and insulin responses after consumption compared to conventional rice in healthy adults, ages 18-40. Eighteen healthy men and women will participate in this study. This study will determine how high blood glucose and insulin values rise after eating a portion of rice. This study will also evaluate hunger ratings after consuming rice. The results of this study will help researchers better understand how diet can influence diabetes management.","This is a pilot study to assess glucose response in humans to a rice sample prepared with high amylose rice (high amylose rice 1 and high amylose rice 2), compared to conventional rice and a glucose test beverage.

Study Design: The proposed study is a randomized single-blind crossover design with repeated measures using human subjects (clinical study).

Treatment: The amount of resistant starch, a type of dietary fiber, is greater for high amylose varieties of rice than conventional varieties of rice. High amylose rice is commercially produced in Louisiana and Arkansas, USA. This specific rice has been bred to contain more amylose than ordinary (conventional) rice.

Kaiser Permanente,OTHER,NCT05359679,Can Value Champions Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing for People With Dementia?,Impact Collaboratory Transforming Dementia Care - Can Value Champions Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing for People With Dementia?,"The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of training a clinician to be a 'value champion' within clinical settings to decrease the use of three classes of potentially inappropriate prescription medications (PIMs) among people living with dementia (PLWD). Secondary objectives include determining if the intervention is associated with a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations due to a fall, and examining five implementation outcomes: appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and equity.

This study is a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial to test the effectiveness of a primary care clinician value champion for de-implementing PIMs among patients 65 years of age and older with a diagnosis of dementia. Medicare Part D pharmacy claims data will be analyzed at the end of the 12-month intervention for the primary outcome, the medication possession rates (MPR) for three groups of potentially inappropriate medications: antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, and hypoglycemic medications (sulfonylureas and insulin). In a similar fashion, a hospital admission, or an emergency department visit for a fall will be assessed at the end of the intervention using Medicare claims data. Finally, the five implementation outcomes will be evaluated at the end of the intervention from notes entered by the value champions in project workbooks.

Primary care clinics within each of the two participating ACOs will be randomized to either the intervention or control arms of the study. Prior to random assignment, the investigators will stratify practices based on high versus low historic prescribing rates. A primary care clinician from each clinic selected for the trial in the intervention arm (n=30 across the two ACOs) will be recruited as a clinician value champion for each intervention clinic. The clinician value champion will participate in twice monthly value champion web-based training sessions for six months and then launch a 12-month initiative within the clinician value champions' clinics to reduce PIM prescribing among PLWD. Study outcomes will be assessed 12 months after the clinician value champions launch the initiative.

The hypothesis is that for each medication class, the intervention will produce clinically relevant decreases in mean possession rates of 10% of a standard deviation in patients seen in intervention clinics compared to those who are seen in control group clinics.","Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus:

For people living with dementia (PLWD) the overuse of Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIMs), those for which the potential for harm outweighs benefit, remains a persistent problem despite evidence-based guidelines supporting de-adoption. A group of geriatric experts convened by the Choosing Wisely initiative identified three classes of PIMs for PLWD: antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and hypoglycemics (sulfonylureas and insulin) with adequate glycemic control. In a systematic review the prevalence of PIMs when cognitive impairment was reported ranged from 20.6% to 80.5%. Approximately 14.3% of Medicare Part D enrollees with dementia residing in the general community are prescribed an antipsychotic. The prevalence of potentially inappropriate benzodiazepine prescriptions has been reported to be as high as 20% among elderly persons with dementia living in the community. The proportion of elderly patients with an A1c \< 7% who received a prescription for sulfonylurea, insulin or combined insulin and sulfonylurea therapies was 35.2%, 24.2% and 16.3% respectively and was as prevalent in those with dementia as in those without. Park and colleagues compared rates of prescribing low-value medications in the elderly from 2006-2015 in both traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Not only was there no difference in rates between the two groups, there was also no evidence of any decline in rates of prescribing over time, including use of benzodiazepines in PLWD.

Study Rationale:

The rationale for decreasing the use of PIMs is that use in this population of patients results in a greater likelihood of harm than benefit. Documented harms in the medical literature includes falls, worsening cognitive impairment, hospital admission, functional impairment, and death.

Name and Description of the Intervention:

One clinician value champion from each clinic randomized to the intervention arm will complete a value champion training program led by the P.I. and then implement care redesign activities in the clinical practice setting to reduce the use of low value prescribing in older adults with dementia. The 6-month training phase will consist of twice monthly web-based training sessions. A recently completed Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)-funded Value Champion Fellowship program resulted in the development of a training curriculum comprised of 10 learning modules for the training phase of the intervention and a project workbook to guide clinician value champions during the 12-month project phase. Following the 6 months of training, clinician value champions will participate in a monthly 1-hour shared learning sessions via video conference to share successes, challenges, and brainstorm solutions for 12 months (months 10-22 of the study). The investigators will invite former value champion fellows and faculty from the RWJF fellowship to participate in these meetings to support this new cohort of value champions.","Inclusion Criteria - clinician practices:

Demographic data, past medical/surgical histories, social history and habits, risk factors, medication list, nutritional status, stage and location of tumor treated, dose/duration of radiation, and time elapsed since radiation treatment will be reviewed and recorded. Subjects will complete a quality of life questionnaire, describe (presence/absence) dry mouth symptoms prior to HBO therapy, and provide current A1c level, or submit to a finger stick. The following groups will be evaluated: 1. Head-and-neck irradiated subjects with ORN (indicating HBO therapy) 2. Subjects with other conditions indicating HBO therapy (positive control), and 3. Head-and-neck irradiated subjects without ORN (negative control). Subjects will include 78 males or females, 18 years old and over. In total, participation will last 22 weeks.","This is a prospective study in a human model examining treatment of patients who have sustained damage to salivary glands following head and neck radiation, subsequent xerostomia, and who are currently indicated for hyperbaric oxygen therapy for treatment of osteoradionecrosis. Salivary flow rates, pH and buffering capacity before and after hyperbaric oxygen treatments will be collected using GC America (Alsip, Illinois) Saliva-Check BUFFER Kit and results will be recorded. The 6 tests take 10 minutes to complete per patient. According to GC America, these tests are simple, demonstrate salivary dysfunction, help identify factors affecting salivary dysfunction, and assist in the diagnosis of xerostomia. Salivary testing and data collection will occur on 8 independent visits over the course of hyperbaric oxygen treatment and during follow-up. Stimulated saliva samples will be used to measure proteins that are involved in salivary gland revascularization and repair. Saliva samples will be stored at less than or equal to -20C for up to 1 year. Measurements of salivary VEGF-A, IGF-1, and Thrombospondin-1 will be quantified using R\&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) ELISA kits and results will be recorded. Salivary Alpha-Amylase will be measured using Rocky Mountain Diagnostics, Inc (Colorado Springs, CO) Alpha-Amylase Saliva kit. Protein analysis will be done on stimulated saliva samples collected at 4 independent visits: first week, fourth week, eighth week, sixteenth week.

The medical, surgical, and health histories of each participant will be reviewed. Each participant will complete the EORTC quality of life core questionnaire (QLQ - C30 v3.0), including head and neck cancer module, at the start and completion of the trial. A blood sample from each participant will be drawn, and analyzed for A1c levels and albumin levels. During the first, fourth, eighth, and sixteenth week, following Saliva-Check BUFFER Kit testing done before HBO therapy, additional saliva will be collected to ensure that a minimum of 2 mL of saliva can be stored at less than or equal to -20 oC for protein analysis.

After salivary testing, each patient will enter a hyperbaric oxygen chamber located at Loma Linda University Medical Center. The patient will gradually be elevated to therapeutic oxygen levels over an 8-12 minute period. At this time, 100% oxygen will be administered at 2.0 ATA or 2.5 ATA, at the discretion of the treating physician, for 90 minutes. A 10-minute air-break will be given after the first 45 minutes if the patients are on the 2.5 ATA protocol. At the conclusion of the oxygen treatment, the oxygen and pressure levels are gradually decreased over 8-12 minutes to return to a depth of 1 ATA. After exiting the hyperbaric oxygen chamber, salivary testing will once again be performed on each patient.

Collected data will be compared to two independent control groups. The Positive Control Group will include 26 individuals who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria: participants for whom hyperbaric oxygen treatment is indicated, but who have not had radiation therapy for head or neck cancer. The Negative Control Group will include the first 26 individuals who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria: participants who have previously had head and neck radiation therapy, but for whom hyperbaric oxygen treatment is not indicated. Salivary data for the Positive Control Group will be collected in such as way as to parallel data collected for the Treatment Group. Salivary data will be collected in the same way for the Negative Control Group with the following modifications: salivary flow rate testing will only be performed once during each visit and salivary testing will be spaced on the basis of time in days in contrast to number of hyperbaric oxygen treatment sessions.","Inclusion Criteria:

This is a prospective study in a human model examining treatment of patients who have sustained damage to salivary glands following head and neck radiation, subsequent xerostomia, and who are currently indicated for hyperbaric oxygen therapy for treatment of osteoradionecrosis. Salivary flow rates, pH and buffering capacity before and after hyperbaric oxygen treatments will be collected using GC America (Alsip, Illinois) Saliva-Check BUFFER Kit and results will be recorded. The 6 tests take 10 minutes to complete per patient. According to GC America, these tests are simple, demonstrate salivary dysfunction, help identify factors affecting salivary dysfunction, and assist in the diagnosis of xerostomia. Salivary testing and data collection will occur on 8 independent visits over the course of hyperbaric oxygen treatment and during follow-up. Stimulated saliva samples will be used to measure proteins that are involved in salivary gland revascularization and repair. Saliva samples will be stored at less than or equal to -20C for up to 1 year. Measurements of salivary VEGF-A, IGF-1, and Thrombospondin-1 will be quantified using R\&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) ELISA kits and results will be recorded. Salivary Alpha-Amylase will be measured using Rocky Mountain Diagnostics, Inc (Colorado Springs, CO) Alpha-Amylase Saliva kit. Protein analysis will be done on stimulated saliva samples collected at 4 independent visits: first week, fourth week, eighth week, sixteenth week. The medical, surgical, and health histories of each participant will be reviewed. Each participant will complete the EORTC quality of life core questionnaire (QLQ - C30 v3.0), including head and neck cancer module, at the start and completion of the trial. A blood sample from each participant will be drawn, and analyzed for A1c levels and albumin levels. During the first, fourth, eighth, and sixteenth week, following Saliva-Check BUFFER Kit testing done before HBO therapy, additional saliva will be collected to ensure that a minimum of 2 mL of saliva can be stored at less than or equal to -20 oC for protein analysis. After salivary testing, each patient will enter a hyperbaric oxygen chamber located at Loma Linda University Medical Center. The patient will gradually be elevated to therapeutic oxygen levels over an 8-12 minute period. At this time, 100% oxygen will be administered at 2.0 ATA or 2.5 ATA, at the discretion of the treating physician, for 90 minutes. A 10-minute air-break will be given after the first 45 minutes if the patients are on the 2.5 ATA protocol. At the conclusion of the oxygen treatment, the oxygen and pressure levels are gradually decreased over 8-12 minutes to return to a depth of 1 ATA. After exiting the hyperbaric oxygen chamber, salivary testing will once again be performed on each patient. Collected data will be compared to two independent control groups. The Positive Control Group will include 26 individuals who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria: participants for whom hyperbaric oxygen treatment is indicated, but who have not had radiation therapy for head or neck cancer. The Negative Control Group will include the first 26 individuals who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria: participants who have previously had head and neck radiation therapy, but for whom hyperbaric oxygen treatment is not indicated. Salivary data for the Positive Control Group will be collected in such as way as to parallel data collected for the Treatment Group. Salivary data will be collected in the same way for the Negative Control Group with the following modifications: salivary flow rate testing will only be performed once during each visit and salivary testing will be spaced on the basis of time in days in contrast to number of hyperbaric oxygen treatment sessions. Inclusion Criteria: * Patient age: 18+. * Patient must give informed consent. Treatment Group * Patient has completed head and neck irradiation treatment. * Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is indicated and patient has accepted said treatment. * Patient must be able to complete hyperbaric oxygen course of treatment. Positive Control Group * Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is indicated and patient has accepted said treatment. * Patient must be able to complete hyperbaric oxygen course of treatment. Negative Control Group * Patient has completed head and neck irradiation treatment. * Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has not been used.

Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,OTHER,NCT01261884,Exercise in Pregnancy for Reduction of Blood Pressure in Obese Patients,Exercise Intervention in Pregnancy for Reduction of Blood Pressure in Obese Gravidas,"Preeclampsia and other high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy are a significant cause of both maternal and fetal complications of pregnancy. To date, there is no known ""cure"" for preeclampsia, but studies have shown that exercise may lower the risk of preeclampsia and high blood pressure disorders in pregnancy. Resistance training also lowers blood pressure, and may be easier to perform in a pregnant population, leading to higher compliance. The investigators propose to perform a novel prospective study of a resistance training regimen on blood pressure in pregnant patients at high risk for developing preeclampsia or high blood pressure.","Hypertension affects 5-10 percent of pregnancies, and complications from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the third leading cause of maternal death in the United States. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, lead to preterm delivery, morbidity and mortality of mother, fetus, and neonate, and are a predictor of development of chronic maternal hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease. Maternal obesity is increasing dramatically in the patient population, and is an independent risk factor for hypertension and preeclampsia, increasing the risk by two- to four-fold. To date, no effective preventative measure has been found to reduce the risk of preeclampsia or hypertension in high risk pregnant patients. However, observational studies have shown that patients who exercise or who have increased physical activity before and during pregnancy have lower rates of preeclampsia, hypertension, and gestational diabetes. Exercise has been shown in numerous studies to be safe in pregnancy, and is recommended by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology as part of routine prenatal care. However, aerobic exercise can be viewed by patients to be difficult to perform during pregnancy, particularly when the patient is obese and at later gestations. Adherence to exercise regimens is therefore low in this patient group. Dynamic resistance training has been shown to lower mean blood pressure both acutely and long term in non-pregnant hypertensive patients, and can be performed more easily by patients with mobility issues. This intervention has not been studied in an obese pregnant population for its effects on blood pressure throughout pregnancy.

The long term goal is to develop an intervention that will reduce the barriers to exercise of obese pregnant women that will, in turn, reduce their risk of developing preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The specific objective of this proposal is to study the effect of a structured resistance training exercise intervention on blood pressure in obese pregnant woman, who would be considered high risk for development of hypertensive disorders based on pre-pregnancy BMI. The central hypothesis is that obese pregnant patients who participate in a regular, structured resistance training exercise regimen will have a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure compared to obese pregnant patients who are strongly encouraged to do aerobic exercise (lifestyle intervention) or who participate in routine prenatal care. The investigators formulated this hypothesis, in part, based upon previous studies found in the literature performed in non-pregnant hypertensive patients.

National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,NCT00050479,Laser and Medical Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema,Preliminary Multi-Center Assessment of Laser and Medical Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema,"This study will compare the side effects of two laser treatments for diabetic macular edema, a common condition in patients with diabetes. In macular edema, blood vessels in the retina, a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye become leaky and the retina swells. The macula, the center part of the retina that is responsible for fine vision may also swell, causing vision loss. Traditional laser treatment (argon blue or green or yellow) for macular swelling, or edema, causes scarring that can expand and possibly lead to more loss of vision. Studies with a different type of laser (diode) may be less damaging. The results of this study on side effects of the treatments will be used to design a larger study of effectiveness. This study will also examine whether celecoxib (Celebrex® (Registered Trademark)), an anti-arthritis drug that reduces inflammation and swelling, can reduce inflammation and swelling of the retina. Patients with elevated cholesterol levels will be invited to participate in a cholesterol reduction part of the study to compare normal-pace cholesterol reduction with accelerated reduction.

Patients 18 years of age and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and macular edema that requires laser treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with the following tests and procedures:

* Medical history: to review past medical conditions and treatments.
* Physical examination: to measure vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature, breathing rate) and examine the head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, arms and legs.
* Eye examination: to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and examine pupils, lens, retina, and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops for this examination.
* Blood tests: to measure cholesterol, blood clotting time, hemoglobin A1C (a measure of diabetes control), and to evaluate liver and kidney function.
* Eye photography: to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur in the future. Special photographs of the inside of the eye are taken using a camera that flashes a bright light into the eye. From 2 to 20 pictures may be taken, depending on the eye condition.
* Fluorescein angiography: to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.

Participants will be randomly assigned to take celecoxib or placebo (an inactive, look-alike pill). Participants who have elevated cholesterol levels may return for a brief visit after 1 month. All patients will return for follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients who require laser treatment will be randomly assigned to one of the two laser treatments. For these procedures, eye drops are put in the eye to numb the surface and a contact lens is placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Several visits may be required for additional laser treatments. The maximum number of treatments depends on how well the treatment is working. Patients who respond well to the study medication may receive no laser treatments. After the first year, patients will be followed every 6 months until either the patient returns for a 3-year visit, the last enrolled patient returns for the 1-year visit, or the patient requests to leave the study. During the follow-up visits, patients' response to treatment will be evaluated with repeat tests of several of the screening exams.","This randomized pilot study is an important first step in planning a large multi-center clinical trial to evaluate medical and laser approaches that could improve the visual outcome for patients with diabetic retinopathy. This study will provide preliminary safety data on these therapies as well as allow for assessment of the performance of ocular outcomes and study design for use in subsequent trials. If there are no safety concerns, the results of this pilot will be helpful in the design of a large multicenter clinical trial by providing data on estimates of expected treatment effects.

Using a factorial design, this study will compare (1) diode (micropulse) laser photocoagulation to mild ETDRS style focal photocoagulation and, (2) treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib), or placebo prior to and following laser photocoagulation. The primary outcomes are a visual acuity drop or increase of 15 letters or more from baseline to year 3. The secondary outcome is a significant reduction in macular edema, defined as a 50% reduction in thickening as measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a two step reduction in macular thickness compared to standard stereoscopic fundus photographs, and a 50% reduction in the area of leakage as measured by fluorescein angiography. The University of Wisconsin Fundus Photography Reading Center will grade OCT, photographs, and angiograms and will be masked to treatment assignment. Other secondary outcomes will include the timing of the first required laser treatment, changes in visual acuity throughout the study, and the number of laser treatments required during the course of the study. In addition, all adverse events and abnormal laboratory values will be collected and tabulated. Specific objectives regarding safety and efficacy follow:

Safety

Is the risk of visual loss in patients with clinically significant diabetic macular edema potentially different across treatment groups?

Preliminary Assessment of Potential Outcomes

Is there evidence that any treatment combinations could be effective in reducing retinal thickening?

Is there evidence that celecoxib may inhibit or induce retinal thickening?

What are the estimated treatment effects on vision?

Is the number of laser treatments required to achieve a reduction in retinal thickening similar across treatment groups?

The tertiary objective of this study will be to examine the effects of dramatically reducing low-density lipoproteins cholesterol in patients with diabetic macular edema and elevated serum lipid levels. Change vision and retinal thickness will be compared across three groups; (1) patients without elevated serum lipids at baseline, (2) patients with elevated lipid levels at baseline and receive standard of care treatment, and (3) patients with elevated lipid levels at baseline and are aggressively treated pharmacologically.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Pierre and Marie Curie University,OTHER,NCT03650179,Influence of the Urine Stream Interruption Exercise on the Micturition,Influence of the Urine Stream Interruption Exercise on the Micturition,This study assess micturition characteristic during and after a urine stream interruption exercise in patient without neurological or urologic disease.,"Urine stream interruption during voluntary voiding is often performed by women as a pelvic floor muscle exercise to develop urinary strength and avoid urinary incontinence. To our knowledge, there is no recommendation for performing urine stream interruption. Without evidence based data, stooping the urinary flow is reported as a risk of post void residual and urinary infection. The experts did not recommended to practice urine stream interruption as a pelvic floor exercise in urinary incontinence. However, during pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence, exercises of urine stream interruption are often performed without knowledge of their consequences. The aim of this study is to assess micturition characteristic during and after a urine stream interruption exercise.

In this study, the investigators will compare the two uroflowmetries usually done in a Neuro-urology department of a University Hospital. Patient without neurological or urologic disease, consulting for a global evaluation of functional digestive disease and performing an urodynamic study will be included. During the urodynamic evaluation, two uroflowmetries are performed : one conventional uroflowmetry complying with the International Continence Society (ICS) recommendations and one uroflowmetry during exercise of urine stream interruption, as usually done in the department. Each uroflowmetry will be performed when the patient will feel a ''normal'' desire to void. For the urine stream interruption micturition, patients will be asked to ""begin the micturition, stop at 3 seconds of micturition, when the stream is interrupt, start again voiding, again stop at 3 seconds of micturition and repeat this maneuver until the end of the micturition"". As usual, sonographic estimation of post-void residual volume will complete each uroflowmetry.

The investigators will compare the voiding volume, the post-void residual volume, the maximal flow rate, the time to reach the maximal flow rate, the voiding time and the slope of the uroflowmetry (corresponding to the flow velocity acceleration) between the two uroflowmetries. For each voiding sequence of the urine stream interruption micturition the following parameters will be reported and compared: voiding volume and duration, maximal flow rate, time to reach the maximal flow rate, the latency to restart the micturition between each voiding sequence and the slope of the uroflowmetry.

Statistical analysis will be carried out using R 3.2.3 software (R Development Core Team, http://www.R-project.org) and R studio version 1.0.136. Differences between the two uroflowmetries will be evaluated using Student test. Correlation between the place of the voiding sequence in the urine stream interruption micturition and the different parameters will be evaluated using Pearson's correlations.","Inclusion Criteria:

The investigators will compare the voiding volume, the post-void residual volume, the maximal flow rate, the time to reach the maximal flow rate, the voiding time and the slope of the uroflowmetry (corresponding to the flow velocity acceleration) between the two uroflowmetries. For each voiding sequence of the urine stream interruption micturition the following parameters will be reported and compared: voiding volume and duration, maximal flow rate, time to reach the maximal flow rate, the latency to restart the micturition between each voiding sequence and the slope of the uroflowmetry. Statistical analysis will be carried out using R 3.2.3 software (R Development Core Team, http://www.R-project.org) and R studio version 1.0.136. Differences between the two uroflowmetries will be evaluated using Student test. Correlation between the place of the voiding sequence in the urine stream interruption micturition and the different parameters will be evaluated using Pearson's correlations.

Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,OTHER,NCT01748084,Rituximab in Systemic Sclerosis,Evaluation of Rituximab in Systemic Sclerosis Associated Polyarthritis,The purpose of this study is to determine whether rituximab is effective in the treatment of articular symptoms that occur in systemic sclerosis related polyarthritis,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare disease, characterized by microvascular and immunological changes promoting extra-cellular matrix synthesis and widespread fibrosis. No treatment has yet proven any ability to alter the disease fibrosing process. Specific auto-antibodies are commonly found in this disease, and B lymphocytes are detected in cutaneous and pulmonary infiltrates. Studies derived from murine models suggest a role for B lymphocyte blocking strategies.

This lead to observational trials of B-cell therapy using rituximab in SSc that provided encouraging results with no particular signal concerning tolerability. These trials included heterogeneous patients with variable disease stages and different involved organs, and were mostly unblinded, which preclude any definitive conclusion. However, they support the continuous development of this therapeutic approach.

Taking up the early phase of the diffuse form of the disease is complicated by its rarity and the heterogeneous progression of its visceral complications. This raises the question of selecting a homogeneous group of patients to evaluate. The most convincing results for the use of rituximab in autoimmune conditions have been found in rheumatoid arthritis. Joint involvement is common in SSc with 75% of patients complaining about joint stiffness and pain, and 30% presenting with synovitis, tenosynovitis, or flexion contractures. No specific treatment has already addressed this issue, and it is generally proposed to use small doses of oral corticosteroids in association with methotrexate, by analogy with rheumatoid arthritis. We propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab in SSc patients having active arthritis despite first line treatment. Improving the articular involvement would improve the quality of life f SSc patients and effectiveness of rituximab on skin and lung fibrotic involvements will be assessed as secondary outcomes to estimate the overall effects of this drug on SSc.","Inclusion Criteria:

Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, and certain chemotherapy drugs, helps stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. More chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of topotecan when given together with cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, melphalan, and cisplatin, followed by an autologous peripheral stem cell transplant in treating patients with stage III, stage IV, or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous infusion intravenous topotecan hydrochloride when administered with intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin and intravenous melphalan in patients with stage III, stage IV, or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.
* To describe the toxicities of each dose studied.
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of topotecan hydrochloride when administered at the maximum tolerated dose and cisplatin.
* To confirm the pharmacokinetic advantage of high-dose IP cisplatin and IP paclitaxel.
* To obtain tissue at the time of peritoneal catheter placement in order to evaluate the molecular determinants of apoptosis (including p53 status, p21 gene expression, bcl-2 gene expression, and bcl-2/bax ratio) and the extent of apoptosis by the TdT assay.
* To evaluate the molecular determinants of DNA damage and repair, including expression levels of ERCC1 and MDR1, and HER2/neu expression by immunohistochemistry.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of topotecan hydrochloride.

Patients undergo surgical placement of an intraperitoneal (IP) catheter. Tumor biopsies are obtained during surgery for laboratory analysis of molecular determinants of apoptosis (including p53 status, p21 gene expression, bcl-2 gene expression, bcl-2/bax ratio) and molecular determinants of DNA damage and repair (including expression levels of ERCC1 and MDR1, and HER2/neu expression by immunohistochemistry). The extent of apoptosis is also assessed using the TdT assay.

* Course 1: Patients receive paclitaxel IP on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV on day 2, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 3 and continuing until apheresis is completed. Patients undergo apheresis until ≥ 2.5 X 10\^6 CD34-positive cells/kg are collected. Two weeks later, patients proceed to course 2.
* Course 2: Patients receive cisplatin IP and melphalan IV on days -11 and -4 and topotecan hydrochloride by continuous infusion over 120 hours on days -10 to -6. Patients receive 25% of their peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) on day -3 and G-CSF IV beginning on day -3 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients receive their remaining PBSCs on day 0.

Patients undergo daily blood sample collection during topotecan hydrochloride administration for pharmacokinetic studies. Patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan hydrochloride undergo additional blood sample collections for pharmacokinetic studies.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.","DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

After working length determination, instrumentation, and irrigation of the root canals, apical plug will be done. in MTA Group, MTA will be placed into the apical 4 mm of root canals, then a moist cotton pellet will be placed and the access cavity will be restored with glass-ionomer-based restoration. Next day, glass-ionomer-based restoration and the cotton pellet will be removed, then the coronal restoration will be completed with GIC, composite. In the Premixed Bioceramic Putty group, Well-Root™ PT will be placed into the apical 4 mm of the canals. After 12 min, the coronal and middle third of the root canal will be filled with gutta-percha.
