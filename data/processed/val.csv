"University of Maryland, Baltimore",OTHER,NCT02095184,GCC 1366: Anti-Proliferative Response to NeoAdjuvant AIs in Overweight and Obese Patients,GCC 1366: A Prospective Study of Neoadjuvant Non-Steroidal Aromatase Inhibitors to Evaluate Anti-Proliferative Response in Obese and Overweight Patients,"More than three quarter of patients with breast cancer are treated by hormone pills called tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). AIs are drugs that stop female hormone production. This hormone production mostly happens in fat, muscle, and breast tissue in postmenopausal women. The female hormone estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer cells. Anastrozole (Arimidex®) and Letrozole (Femara®) are AIs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They have been used since 2005 to treat women with early stage breast cancer.

When given before surgery (neoadjuvant), both anastrozole and letrozole have been shown to successfully shrink breast cancer tumors in most patients. In over 50% of patients, anastrozole and letrozole when given for about 4 months also helped to improve surgery outcomes. On top of that, whether or not a patient responds to anastrozole and letrozole before surgery can help the doctor decide whether that patient needs additional chemotherapy.

One of the things may influence the level of hormone is body weight. It has been previously shown that postmenopausal women with higher body fat have higher level of female hormone as well as an increased risk of breast cancer. This is likely due to an increase in aromatase activity in the fatty tissue. However, at the current time AIs are used at the same doses in all women with breast cancer no matter whether they have different body weight. Currently, we do not know for certain whether the same doses of AIs work as well in patients with higher body fat compared to patients with less body fat.

The purpose of this study is to see if women with higher body fat respond differently to AI treatment compared to women with lower body fat.","GCC 1366 is a prospective randomized window trial to evaluate the anti-proliferative response in obese and overweight breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors. Post-menopausal women over the age of 18 years with estrogen receptor positive Her 2 neu negative stage II-III breast cancer are eligible. Participants will be randomized according to BMI to neoadjuvant treatment with Arimidex or Letrozole.

A total of 90 patients will be enrolled with 15 patients in each cohort below.

* Cohort 1: Patients with BMI \< 25.0 kg/m2 treating with anastrozole
* Cohort 2: Patients with BMI ≥ 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 treating with anastrozole
* Cohort 3: Patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 treating with anastrozole
* Cohort 4: Patients with BMI \< 25.0 kg/m2 treating with letrozole
* Cohort 5: Patients with BMI ≥ 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 treating with letrozole
* Cohort 6: Patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 treating with letrozole

Based on the patients' calculated BMI, patients in each BMI category (normal, overweight, and obese) will be enrolled in the different cohorts as described above. The first 15 patients in each BMI category will be treated with anastrozole. After completion of enrollment in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, subsequent patients will be treated with letrozole in cohorts 4, 5, and 6.

Anastrozole 1 mg or Letrozole 2.5 mg oral daily will be administered and continued for a minimum of 14 days and a maximum of 28 days (2-4 weeks). Surgery will be performed between weeks 2-3 of treatment unless there are compelling medical or personal reasons that prevent a patient from having surgery during this time. In those cases, patients may continue anastrozole or letrozole up to 4 weeks before surgery. Surgery should be performed within 36 hours of the last dose of anastrozole or letrozole.

Tumor tissue that is obtained for diagnosis or to assess response to initial AI therapy will be utilized for correlative studies. A patient may be continued on anastrozole or letrozole beyond 4 weeks (up to 18 weeks) if in the opinion of the treating physician, the patient will benefit from extended endocrine therapy. In this context, patients will have a core needle biopsy performed at 2-4 weeks after treatment to assess Ki67 response to AI therapy. Patients with an appropriate response to treatment as determined by a decrease in Ki67 levels (≤10%) will be continued on AI treatment. Patients without an appropriate decrease in Ki67 levels will be recommended to have immediate surgery or a switch to neoadjuvant chemotherapy if desired by the patient and treating physician.

Patients on extended AI neoadjuvant treatment having core biopsy at 2-4 weeks for Ki67 determination for clinical decision making will be approached and consented for additional research tissues to be taken at the same time as the biopsy for Ki67 determination. Blood samples will be collected prior to starting treatment and within 3 days or on the day of surgery. Additional blood samples will be obtained as clinically necessary.

Clinical assessment will be performed prior to enrollment and within 3 days or on the day of surgery. For patients who continue neoadjuvant endocrine therapy past 4 weeks, clinical assessment will be performed at the time of clinical biopsy and every 4-6 weeks thereafter. For clinical evidence of progression, patients will be offered immediate surgery or switch to neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician.

Radiological assessment including mammogram, ultrasound, and breast MRI will be performed as per standard of care.

Patients will be followed for 30 days on study after the last dose of anastrozole or letrozole prior to surgery. For patients who receive extended neoadjuvant therapy with anastrozole or letrozole and for patients who receive other primary treatment after anastrozole or letrozole administration prior to surgery, patients will be followed for 30 days on study after the last dose of anastrozole or letrozole. Patients continuing to experience adverse events attributable to anastrozole or letrozole will be followed as needed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse events. Patients who are either found to be ineligible or refuse to start treatment after consenting will not be followed and will be replaced. Their information will not be collected. After 30 days after the last dose of anastrozole or letrozole, if there are no continuing adverse events attributable to treatment, patients will be off study.","Inclusion Criteria:

Harokopio University,OTHER,NCT05396079,Effect of Tahini in Oxidative Stress and Endothelial Function in Diabetes,Effect of Tahini Consumption on Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Markers as Well as Endothelial Function and Arterial Stiffness in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD), a cluster of disorders that affect heart and blood vessels, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world and is responsible for 17.9 million deaths annually worldwide. CVD risk factors can be modifiable (nutrition, physical activity, obesity, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes) and non-modifiable (age, gender, ethnicity, family history and socioeconomic status). Chronic exposure to CVD risk factors induces oxidative stress and promotes inflammation. In addition, endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory reaction secrete growth factors, leading to the destruction of vascular endothelium and promoting atherogenesis.

Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant compounds, with predominance of the pro-oxidant ones. Reactive Oxygen Species overproduction has been implicated in pathogenesis and complications of numerous diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic kidney disease.

Moreover, endothelium consists of a single layer of endothelial cells; it is the natural barrier between blood and tissues and also an endocrine organ. It plays a key role in vascular homeostasis by maintaining a balance between vasodilation and vasoconstriction and is responsible for fluid filtration, blood vessel tone, hormone trafficking, hemostasis, regulation of blood flow and growth of blood vessels. Thus, reductions in endothelial function are detrimental and predict and precede the development of overt CVD.

Sesame belongs to Pedaliaceae family and can be consumed in different forms such as seeds, oil or tahini, i.e., a 100 % peeled, ground and roasted sesame paste. Tahini is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, proteins, vitamin E and lignans, such as sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol. Recent studies have indicated that tahini consumption can lower blood pressure and pulse rate and improve endothelial function and glycemic response in healthy males postprandially.

However, only two studies are available in the current literature concerning the effect on diabetes, one of them in patients with type 2 diabetes and one in diabetic animal model. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of tahini consumption on oxidative stress, blood pressure, endothelial function and arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes postprandially.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD), a cluster of disorders that affect heart and blood vessels, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world and is responsible for 17.9 million deaths annually worldwide. CVD includes coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. CVD risk factors can be modifiable (nutrition, physical activity, obesity, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes) and non-modifiable (age, gender, ethnicity, family history and socioeconomic status). Chronic exposure to CVD risk factors induces oxidative stress and promotes inflammation. In addition, endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory reaction secrete growth factors, leading to the destruction of vascular endothelium and promoting atherogenesis.

Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant compounds, with predominance of the pro-oxidant ones. These compounds are also called Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) or free radicals and are unstable atoms or molecules. Their generation, as products of normal cellular metabolism, occurs naturally by endogenous sources (e.g. mitochondria, peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum) through enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. Furthermore, exogenous sources implicated in free radical production are air pollution, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, ultraviolet light exposure, industrial solvents and others. Free radical production is regulated by the well-organized human endogenous enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant system, along with the exogenous antioxidants found in food. However, in some cases antioxidant system fails to eliminate ROS overproduction and can consequently induce serious damage to important for life biomolecules (DNA, lipids, proteins), leading to cell injury and death. Thus, ROS overproduction has been implicated in pathogenesis and complications of numerous diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic kidney disease.

Sesame belongs to Pedaliaceae family and can be consumed in different forms such as seeds, oil or tahini, i.e., a 100 % peeled, ground and roasted sesame paste. Sesame seeds are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), proteins, vitamin E and lignans, such as sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol. Recent studies have highlighted the antioxidant, antihypertensive, hypolipidemic and appetite control properties of sesame seeds and sesame oil. Moreover, few studies have investigated the effect of sesame consumption on blood pressure, endothelial function and arterial stiffness in human population. According to a metanalysis, sesame consumed in form of seed, oil, capsule or bar decreased both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), while sesame oil consumption was found to improve endothelial function both in the postprandial state and after long term consumption in hypertensive men.

Regarding the consumption of tahini and its effect on human health, only a few studies are available in the current literature. The most recent of them have indicated that tahini consumption can lower blood pressure and pulse rate and improve endothelial function and glycemic response in healthy males postprandially. However, only two studies are available in the current literature concerning the effect on diabetes, one of them in patients with type 2 diabetes and one in diabetic animal model.

NHS Lothian,OTHER_GOV,NCT02438579,Hypertonic Saline Nasal Irrigation and Gargling for the Common Cold.,"Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS). A Pilot Randomised Control Trial of Hypertonic Saline Nasal Irrigation and Gargling on Individuals With the Common Cold to Assess Recruitment, Retention, Side Effects & Effectiveness","Viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), one of the commonest infection faced by humans, have a significant impact on individuals, families, health service and economy. Though rhinoviruses are called the ""common cold virus"", numerous viruses can cause URTI. Hence virus specific remedy for URTI is impractical. There are currently no evidence-based interventions that reduce the severity, symptom duration or viral shedding. Preliminary evidence suggests that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) may reduce the duration of symptoms.

With this pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), the investigators aim to assess the feasibility of undertaking a definitive RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI. This pilot focuses on recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely effect size of the intervention.

This pilot RCT compares HSNIG vs. usual care in 60 adults. Serial self-collected mid-turbinate swabs will help assess change in viral shedding. Symptomatic relief is measured by a validated symptom score. A questionnaire based participant feedback will help assess intervention and trial procedures.

This mixed-methods pilot trial will help inform plans for a definitive RCT of this low-cost intervention that has the potential of substantial health and societal benefits.","1. Aims:

   To assess the feasibility of undertaking a RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI focusing on recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely effect size of the intervention.

   1.1. Research questions:
   1. What is the likely rate of recruitment and loss to follow-up?
   2. Are the study procedures acceptable to participants?
   3. Is there a likely reduction in duration of symptoms and viral shedding?
   4. What effect size is estimated for the definitive trial in relation to duration of symptoms and improvement in quality-of-life?
2. Subjects:

   2.1 Sample size: This is a pilot trial so no formal sample size calculations are indicated. However, with a sample size of 27 per group the investigators would be able to express the proportion of those who return the symptom score diary and samples within that group to within ±19% based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval around an expected proportion of 0.5. With the two groups combined \[i.e. a sample size of 54\] the investigators would be able to express a proportion to within ±13%. To allow for 10% dropouts the sample size has been increased to 30 per group.

   2.2 Recruitment: The investigators propose to enrol a total of 60 participants (30/arm) for this pilot. The investigators plan to recruit by advertising the study in the community by the following routes.
   * Sending flyers to parents through schools run by Edinburgh and Midlothian councils.
   * Study website (www.elvisstudy.com), National Health Service (NHS) Lothian, University of Edinburgh websites.
   * Local media coverage by way of interviews.
   * Flyers in workplaces with large numbers of staff (e.g. banks, supermarkets, councils).
   * Posters in pharmacies and General practitioner (GP) surgeries.

   Interested individuals will be asked to contact the trial nurse at the clinical research facility (CRF) situated at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) and Western General Hospital within 48 hours of symptom onset. The trial nurse will consent, randomise, and recruit volunteers. Participants will be advised to go to their GP as per norm if they become unwell and that they can withdraw from the study if they so wish for other reasons. At the end of their participation in the study, they will be given £30 as recompense for any inconvenience.
3. Research Methods:

   3.1 Randomisation: Participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive intervention or control, this has been done using an online randomisation minimised by sex (M/F) and smoking status (current/not a current smoker) and allocated to each treatment arm with a probability 0.9 to ensure a random allocation.

   3.2 Instructions to participants: 3.2.1 Both arms: Participants are taught to complete (online or paper) a modified short Wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey (WURSS-21-Scot) and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Baseline symptom scores are recorded by the participant.

   Participants are taught to collect nasal swabs. A baseline swab is collected under observation and sent to the virology laboratory at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE). Swabs, transport medium and Royal Mail Safebox will be provided to the participant to collect a nasal swab first thing in the morning (before HSNIG for the intervention arm) for four consecutive days and return to the laboratory.

   3.2.2 Intervention arm: The intervention group will be shown a video on preparing the hypertonic sea-salt solution and how to perform HSNIG. They will be asked to perform the procedure under supervision. The trial nurse will help them identify the highest concentration of saline they are comfortable with. Participants are advised to perform the intervention as frequently as required (expected frequency around 6 times/day for the first two days, reducing in frequency from day 3 as symptoms improve). A package containing instructions, digital-measuring spoon, sea-salt, and equipment for irrigation and flask (if they wish to prepare solution for multiple uses during the day) will then be handed over to the participant. Participants in the intervention arm will also document compliance and side effects daily

   3.2.3 Control arm: They are advised to manage the URTI as they normally do.

   3.3 Data collection: 3.3.1 ""WURSS-21-Scot"" diary and EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire: All participants will complete the ""WURSS-21-Scot"" diary at a set time during the day. Participants will answer the question ""how unwell do you feel today"". If they score \>0, then symptoms and functional ability are graded 0-7. They then answer the global change question. Total score/day is calculated by summing the scores of all 10 symptoms daily. All participants will also answer the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.

   The following information is collected at recruitment: where they heard about the study, influenza vaccination history, number of family members and whether sufficient information was provided.

   The intervention arm will also answer the following questions daily: how many times they performed HSNIG, if they performed one or both parts of HSNIG and if there were any side effects.

   Both arms will answer if they had to take any medications for the URTI and whether they needed to contact the GP for further management of their URTI.

   Diaries are maintained until participant records ""not unwell"" on two consecutive days or for a maximum of 14 days or until follow up is terminated because the individual needs further treatment.

   3.3.2 Virology: Swabs will be sent to the Department of Virology, RIE for testing. Baseline samples will be tested to identify individuals in whom an aetiology can be proven. If a viral aetiology is identified, all samples (day 0 - day 4) will be tested in parallel to identify change in viral shedding.

   3.3.3 Data collection procedures: The trial nurse will follow up participants who do not complete the diary or return samples (after 48 hours of expected return). Information on number of family members with URTI will be collected at the end of the study. Feedback will be collected from participants after the follow-up period. These will address acceptability, health service use, costs to the patient and suggestions for improving the study procedures for the main trial.
4. Data Analysis:

The number of participants returning swabs, completing diaries and following treatment as per protocol will be presented as percentages (with 95% confidence intervals). The investigators will present recruitment as an overall rate, but also graphically as there is likely to be seasonal variation. Using results from the swabs the investigators will determine when a person stops viral shedding and, using chi-square and chi-square test for trend, determine if there is a relationship between groups. Using two-sample t-tests or non-parametric equivalent as appropriate the investigators will determine if there is any evidence of a difference in the duration of symptoms and symptom severity \[as defined by the maximum WURSS-21-Scot score over treatment period\]. Feedback will be analysed using a conventional content analysis approach, with emerging findings discussed by the research team to aid interpretation of findings.","Inclusion Criteria:

Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study (ELVIS). A Pilot Randomised Control Trial of Hypertonic Saline Nasal Irrigation and Gargling on Individuals With the Common Cold to Assess Recruitment, Retention, Side Effects & Effectiveness Viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), one of the commonest infection faced by humans, have a significant impact on individuals, families, health service and economy. Though rhinoviruses are called the ""common cold virus"", numerous viruses can cause URTI. Hence virus specific remedy for URTI is impractical. There are currently no evidence-based interventions that reduce the severity, symptom duration or viral shedding. Preliminary evidence suggests that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling (HSNIG) may reduce the duration of symptoms. With this pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), the investigators aim to assess the feasibility of undertaking a definitive RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI. This pilot focuses on recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely effect size of the intervention. This pilot RCT compares HSNIG vs. usual care in 60 adults. Serial self-collected mid-turbinate swabs will help assess change in viral shedding. Symptomatic relief is measured by a validated symptom score. A questionnaire based participant feedback will help assess intervention and trial procedures. This mixed-methods pilot trial will help inform plans for a definitive RCT of this low-cost intervention that has the potential of substantial health and societal benefits. 1. Aims: To assess the feasibility of undertaking a RCT of HSNIG in adults with URTI focusing on recruitment rate, willingness to be randomised, acceptability, compliance and likely effect size of the intervention. 1.1. Research questions: 1. What is the likely rate of recruitment and loss to follow-up? 2. Are the study procedures acceptable to participants? 3. Is there a likely reduction in duration of symptoms and viral shedding? 4. What effect size is estimated for the definitive trial in relation to duration of symptoms and improvement in quality-of-life? 2. Subjects: 2.1 Sample size: This is a pilot trial so no formal sample size calculations are indicated. However, with a sample size of 27 per group the investigators would be able to express the proportion of those who return the symptom score diary and samples within that group to within ±19% based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval around an expected proportion of 0.5. With the two groups combined \[i.e. a sample size of 54\] the investigators would be able to express a proportion to within ±13%.

Mayo Clinic,OTHER,NCT05678179,The Feasibility and Acceptability of Utilizing Telehealth for Increasing Access to Bariatric Surgery,Randomized Pilot Study Investigating the Feasibility and Acceptability of Utilizing Telehealth for Increasing Access to Bariatric Surgery,"Bariatric surgery is recommended as the most efficacious treatment for patients living with obesity (body mass index \[BMI; kg/m2\] \> 40; or BMI 35-39.9 with related medical conditions). Adoption of telehealth services offers an opportunity to reduce barriers and expand access to high quality specialty care for patients considering bariatric surgery for treatment of obesity. Two important advances in telehealth services occurred during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Specifically, the patient's home is now the origin site for all services where patients are no longer required to travel to a designated telehealth location, and the use of telehealth has expanded to multidisciplinary health care teams. Our bariatric surgery care team has gained valuable experience using a combination of face-to-face (F2F) and telehealth visits for multidisciplinary evaluation in preparation for bariatric surgery since March 2020. Appointments that do not require a physical exam like nutrition, psychology, group education, and medical visits after completion of pre-operative testing are particularly amenable to telehealth services. Increased use of telehealth has the potential to reduce barriers to care (e.g., lack of access to accredited bariatric surgery treatment centers, extended travel time for multiple pre-surgery appointments), increase adherence to required program visits, and increase patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction variables may include reduced time away from work, flexibility in appointment scheduling, and reduced physical demands of multiple F2F visits. A necessary first step is to demonstrate that the protocol outlined below can be successfully implemented in a real-world clinical setting and is deemed acceptable by patients preparing for bariatric surgery.","Goals and Objectives

Study participants will be randomized to either a Telehealth treatment group where greater than 50% of visits are conducted via telehealth and testing is completed where the patient resides or to a F2F treatment group. Outcomes will include feasibility and patient acceptability of telehealth visits, adherence to required program visits, program retention, time to surgery, surgery completion, and payment parity data.

Specific aim 1 (primary): The primary aim is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of telehealth for increasing access to bariatric surgery and compare outcomes to patients who receive F2F visits. Feasibility and acceptability were selected as the primary outcomes for this pilot trial because the efficacy of any program is contingent on its ability to be implemented by providers and its acceptability to patients. Hypothesis: The Telehealth treatment group (\> 50% of pre-surgery visits telehealth and testing performed locally) will be feasible to implement as evidenced by our ability to recruit and retain participants and acceptable to participants as evidenced by self-report of satisfaction with the program, adherence to required visits, program retention, time to surgery, and completion of surgery. We hypothesize that when comparing the Telehealth and F2F treatment groups, there will be no clinically meaningful differences regarding outcome variables.

Specific aim 2 (secondary): A secondary aim is to compare payment parity between Telehealth and F2F treatment groups. Hypothesis: Telehealth and F2F visits will be similarly reimbursed for bariatric visits.

Study Participants:

Participants will be 50 patients referred for bariatric surgery and who meet medical necessity criteria for bariatric surgery. Potential participants will be contacted regarding participation in the study prior to their first scheduled appointments. Should a patient wish to volunteer for the study, the study coordinator will conduct the screening interview to determine eligibility based on inclusion criteria and review the study protocol. Potential participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions and then will be asked to provide written informed consent. The consent form will clearly explain that participation in the study is voluntary and will not affect current or future care at any Mayo Clinic.

Inclusion Criteria (1) Meet medical necessity criteria for primary bariatric surgery and reside in FL, (2) can participate fully in all aspects of the protocol and keep scheduled appointments, (3) have in home access to telehealth (4) provide written informed consent, (5) are willing to accept randomization, and (6) have a primary care doctor to facilitate local testing in preparation for bariatric surgery.

Procedures and Measures:

This study will employ an unblinded randomized parallel group design. Participants will be randomly assigned to the Telehealth treatment group (N= 25) or the F2F treatment group (N= 25), where the randomization schedule will be determined by the statistician. The protocol is designed to approximate real-world conditions which will enhance generalizability for expansion to all patients who desire bariatric surgery. Permission to collect basic demographic and medical information from participants who decline to participate in the study will be requested. This information will be used to compare the characteristics of individuals who agree to participate in the study versus those who decline participation. Individuals who discontinue study participation any time prior to having bariatric surgery will be contacted to obtain information regarding the reason for discontinuation.

Recruitment:

Patients will be identified consecutively on bariatric medical provider's calendar. The study coordinator will contact those who meet inclusion criteria by phone. If patients agree to participation in the study, oral consent will be obtained. The HIPPA disclosure form will be sent via email to the participant. Participants will return the signed form via email to the study the coordinator.

Outcome Measures:

Telehealth feasibility will be measured by whether \>50% of telehealth group visits are conducted virtually, and testing is performed locally. Patients who have complex medical problems may require F2F medical and surgeon visits to be determined by medical and surgical providers.

Patient acceptability will be measured by a questionnaire constructed by the authors to capture the acceptability of participation in the Telehealth treatment group compared to the F2F condition. Responses to Likert scale (5-points) items will be summarized as the mean of all items. The treatment will be considered acceptable if greater than 50% of participants rate satisfaction with a mean score of 4 or greater (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). The survey will be administered to all participants via email using Qualtics.

Program Adherence: Adherence will be measured by whether the patient completed of all visits required for bariatric surgery preparation. No show and reschedule data will be collected from the patient records.

Time to Surgery: The number of days will be from the date of the initial consultation to time of surgery will be counted to determine time to surgery.

Program retention and surgery completion will be compared across groups.

Insurance payer parity will be compared across groups.

Benefits:

Telehealth could potentially expand access to high quality specialty bariatric surgery care for patients living with obesity. This may include patients across Florida (and potentially Georgia with licensure strategy recommendations from the Center for Digital Health) who live in rural and/or underserved communities without access to accredited bariatric surgery programs. All bariatric surgery program licensed providers have been utilizing telehealth technology since March 2020, and these visits are now part of routine care. The bariatric surgery program could potentially be marketed as offering equally efficacious pathways to surgery including F2F or a hybrid schedule of telehealth and F2F visits. With positive results these, pathways could be extended to follow-up care (1, 3, 6, 12-months) in the first year after bariatric surgery.","Inclusion Criteria:

Meet medical necessity criteria for primary bariatric surgery and reside in FL, (2) can participate fully in all aspects of the protocol and keep scheduled appointments, (3) have in home access to telehealth (4) provide written informed consent, (5) are willing to accept randomization, and (6) have a primary care doctor to facilitate local testing in preparation for bariatric surgery.

Inclusion Criteria (1) Meet medical necessity criteria for primary bariatric surgery and reside in FL, (2) can participate fully in all aspects of the protocol and keep scheduled appointments, (3) have in home access to telehealth (4) provide written informed consent, (5) are willing to accept randomization, and (6) have a primary care doctor to facilitate local testing in preparation for bariatric surgery. Procedures and Measures: This study will employ an unblinded randomized parallel group design. Participants will be randomly assigned to the Telehealth treatment group (N= 25) or the F2F treatment group (N= 25), where the randomization schedule will be determined by the statistician. The protocol is designed to approximate real-world conditions which will enhance generalizability for expansion to all patients who desire bariatric surgery. Permission to collect basic demographic and medical information from participants who decline to participate in the study will be requested. This information will be used to compare the characteristics of individuals who agree to participate in the study versus those who decline participation. Individuals who discontinue study participation any time prior to having bariatric surgery will be contacted to obtain information regarding the reason for discontinuation. Recruitment: Patients will be identified consecutively on bariatric medical provider's calendar. The study coordinator will contact those who meet inclusion criteria by phone. If patients agree to participation in the study, oral consent will be obtained. The HIPPA disclosure form will be sent via email to the participant. Participants will return the signed form via email to the study the coordinator. Outcome Measures: Telehealth feasibility will be measured by whether \>50% of telehealth group visits are conducted virtually, and testing is performed locally. Patients who have complex medical problems may require F2F medical and surgeon visits to be determined by medical and surgical providers. Patient acceptability will be measured by a questionnaire constructed by the authors to capture the acceptability of participation in the Telehealth treatment group compared to the F2F condition. Responses to Likert scale (5-points) items will be summarized as the mean of all items. The treatment will be considered acceptable if greater than 50% of participants rate satisfaction with a mean score of 4 or greater (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). The survey will be administered to all participants via email using Qualtics. Program Adherence: Adherence will be measured by whether the patient completed of all visits required for bariatric surgery preparation. No show and reschedule data will be collected from the patient records. Time to Surgery: The number of days will be from the date of the initial consultation to time of surgery will be counted to determine time to surgery. Program retention and surgery completion will be compared across groups. Insurance payer parity will be compared across groups. Benefits: Telehealth could potentially expand access to high quality specialty bariatric surgery care for patients living with obesity. This may include patients across Florida (and potentially Georgia with licensure strategy recommendations from the Center for Digital Health) who live in rural and/or underserved communities without access to accredited bariatric surgery programs. All bariatric surgery program licensed providers have been utilizing telehealth technology since March 2020, and these visits are now part of routine care. The bariatric surgery program could potentially be marketed as offering equally efficacious pathways to surgery including F2F or a hybrid schedule of telehealth and F2F visits. With positive results these, pathways could be extended to follow-up care (1, 3, 6, 12-months) in the first year after bariatric surgery. Inclusion Criteria: Meet medical necessity criteria for primary bariatric surgery and reside in FL, (2) can participate fully in all aspects of the protocol and keep scheduled appointments, (3) have in home access to telehealth (4) provide written informed consent, (5) are willing to accept randomization, and (6) have a primary care doctor to facilitate local testing in preparation for bariatric surgery.

The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety of ETH-155008 and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives and endpoints will evaluate the PK and PD of ETH-155008 and preliminary clinical anti-tumor activity of ETH-155008 in subjects with R/R B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ Small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This Trial is a FIH, open-label, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ETH-155008 in subjects with R/R B-cell NHL, CLL/SLL and AML who previously received standard treatment or are ineligible for standard treatment options. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Part 1) and cohort expansion (Part 2). In the dose escalation, ETH-155008 will be administrated orally, once daily (QD) for 28 days at 6 dose levels ranging from 10 mg to 100 mg in 28-day cycles. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed during the first treatment cycle and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified. Addition subjects will be treated in the dose expansion at the commended phase 2 dose (RP2D). During the study, safety will be monitored by the data review committee (DRC) at each dose escalation step and at regular intervals during cohort expansion. Continuous reassessment for DLTs will help minimize the potential risks associated with the study drug. Cumulative data from subsequent treatment cycles will also be monitored for late-onset toxicities.

This illness is associated with long-term abdominal pain. In the 1980s it was proposed that chronic pancreatitis was due to a deficiency of protective ""antioxidants"" in the pancreas and on this basis antioxidant therapy was introduced. This therapy was highly controversial until a large randomised trial of antioxidant therapy in chronic pancreatitis, undertaken in Manchester showed that 6 months intervention with antioxidant therapy was not associated with any change in pain score or improvement in quality of life. Antioxidant therapy is no longer used in modern day pancreatic practice.

However, as with any study, the randomised trial raised some specific questions.

First, does treatment for more than 6 months provide benefit? Second, are there disease sub-types of chronic pancreatitis where antioxidant therapy may benefit?

Given the lack of contemporary use of antioxidant therapy, this question cannot be answered in a prospective study. However, the case records of the Manchester Royal Infirmary contain information on antioxidant treatment in patients who received this therapy over a prolonged period.

Thus the aim of the present study is to review the case notes of patients given a discharge code from the Manchester Royal Infirmary of chronic pancreatitis during the period 1st January 1990 to 1st January 1998 in order to assess whether there is a record of improvement in outcome. Only the case notes will be reviewed and patients will be given an opportunity to opt out.

UMC Utrecht,OTHER,NCT00821379,CoPPer Study - Complications of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Pregnancy: Evaluating Risk,Complications of PCOS Pregnancy: Evaluating Risk,The CoPPer study is a follow-up study of women diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Women will be included pre-conceptional and followed-up until after delivery. The investigators will design a multivariate prediction model of pregnancy outcome in women with PCOS with the intention to define intervention strategies for the future.,"Background of the study:

PCOS is a heterogeneous condition in which metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance are common. Pregnancies in women with PCOS are reported to have an increased chance of being complicated by gestational diabetes, pregnancy induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Subsequently their offspring are reported to have a lower birth weight and higher risk of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. However, the cause of increased complication rate is not yet identified.

The Action Observation (AO) evokes an internal, real-time motor simulation of the movements that the observer is perceiving visually. Both mental processes trigger the activation of the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie the planning and execution of voluntary movements in a manner that resembles how the action is performed in a real manner.

Both observation and imagination share a great number of common mental processes based primarily on sensory perception, and the information stored by memory systems. The activation of the motor command during a mental practice does not induce an active movement probably due to an inhibitory mechanism in the primary motor cortex on the descending corticospinal tract pathways. However, this inhibition is not complete, for it is well known that the training of mental practice involves a component of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).

It has been shown that both MI and AO lead to changes in the ANS that cause excitatory sympathetic responses, although the neurophysiological bases remain uncertain and are still based on hypotheses. The functional relations between both neurocognitive processes and the sympathetic-excitatory nervous system (SNS) could be based on a preparation phase in which, the activation of the SNS, happens to a near effort and, therefore, to a close energy expenditure in physiological processes (i.e., cardiorespiratory adaptationse) which will take place in order to face said metabolic changes produced by the voluntary movement itself. In addition, several hypotheses have been described regarding the notion that the SNS not only has the quantitative objective of providing energy to the muscle effectors, but that it also qualitatively and specifically designs and adapts the parameters on demand in an attempt to save the energy provided for each precise motor execution.

Taking into account that both MI and AO cause sympathetic-excitatory changes that induce an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, electrodermal activity , our hypothesis is that the combination of MI and AO induces an autonomic sympathetic-excitatory shift greater than MI does in isolation. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to compare the results obtained from intervention groups on the subject of the activation of the SNS in a program that combined MI with AO, in contrast to an isolated MI program on the one hand in asymptomatic subjects and in the other hand in patients with chronic low back pain.. The secondary objective of the present study was to explore whether there is any relationship between the sympathetic-excitatory response and the ability to generate motor imagery, the mental chronometry, and the level of physical activity.","Inclusion Criteria asymptomatic subjects:

Mansoura University,OTHER,NCT03323684,Quadratus Lumborum Block vs Transversus Abdominis Plane Block for Post-cholecystectomy Analgesia,Analgesic Efficacy of Ultrasound-guided Quadratus Lumborum Block Versus Transversus Abdominis Plane Block in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy,"In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, overall pain is a conglomerate of three different and clinically separate components: incisional pain (somatic pain) due to trocar insertion sites, visceral pain (deep intra abdominal pain), and shoulder pain due to peritoneal stretching and diaphragmatic irritation associated with carbon dioxide insufflation. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that intense acute pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy may predict development of chronic pain (e.g., postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy syndrome). Without effective treatment, this ongoing pain may delay recovery, mandate inpatient admission, and thereby increase the cost of such care.

Recently, the uses of peripheral axial blocks that deliver local anesthetic into the transversus abdominis fascial plane have become popular for operations that involve incision(s) of the abdominal wall. Thus, the Transversus Abdominis plane (TAP) block has been shown to reduce perioperative opioid use in elective abdominal surgery, including open appendicectomy, laparotomy, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the efficacy of the TAP block is reportedly only reliable in providing analgesia below the umbilicus. The ultrasound-guided subcostal transversus abdominis (STA) block is a recently described variation on the TAP block which produces reliable supraumbilical analgesia. Deposition of local anesthetic in this plane has shown to block dermatomes T6 to T10 with an occasional spread to T12. This variant will be discussed in our study.

Currently, the Quadratus Lumborum block (QL block) is performed as one of the perioperative pain management procedures for all generations (pediatrics, pregnant, and adult) undergoing abdominal surgery. The local anesthetic injected via the approach of the posterior QL block ( QL 2 block ) can more easily extend beyond the TAP to the thoracic paravertebral space or the thoracolumbar plane, the posterior QL block entails a broader sensory-level analgesic and may generate analgesia from T7 to L1. Use of posterior QL block in laparoscopic cholecystectomy has not been investigated before and it is the variant that will be discussed in our study.","The aim of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided posterior quadratus lumborum block and subcostal transversus abdominis plane block in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The primary outcome will be assessment of postoperative opioid analgesic requirements. The secondary outcomes will include assessing intraoperative analgesic requirements, stress of trocar insertion and insufflation, postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS), length of stay at post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), time of first request to analgesia, incidence of nausea, and vomiting.

The study will hypothesize that quadratus lumborum block will be more superior than or equal to transversus abdominis block because it could cover all the dermatome segments from caudally L1 to cranially till T6 segments as the drug is expected to travel from the QL to the higher paravertebral spaces.","Inclusion Criteria:

According to previous studies, anywhere from 20-60% of breast surgery patients report mastalgia as an adverse outcome of surgery (1, 2). Although the exact mechanism has not been well defined, the pain is generally neuropathic in nature and described as a burning sensation, electric and shock like, with a stabbing quality (2,3). The large majority of post-operative mastalgia is therefore believed to be secondary to nerve damage, particularly injury to the intercostobrachial nerve, and less commonly the long thoracic, medial and lateral pectoral, and/or the thoracodorsal nerves. Other reported causes of post-operative breast pain include scarring pain, lymphedema, radiation plexopathy, and hematomas (1-5).

Although patients typically present this disease as newborns and rarely in later infancy, there have been reports of patients presenting with CCHS in adulthood.

The present study reports a unique familial case in which the father (proband) presented late-onset CCHS with an expansion mutation of the Phox2B gene that was confirmed by genetic analysis. Surprisingly, the proband did not report any manifestation of the disease during childhood, and the disease progressed following an insidious course until adulthood. At the time of diagnosis, he did not present signs of pulmonary hypertension and right-side heart failure. The patient responded well to nocturnal invasive ventilation. In contrast, his son presented CCHS as a newborn with the full complement of symptoms while his daughter did not.

The present report shows that CCHS cases characterized by a mutated Phox2 gene can progress without many symptoms and that the treatment approach used here was efficient for controlling the course of the disease. Furthermore, this case indicates that incomplete penetrance can occur. Genetic screening of family members is mandatory to evaluate the reproductive risk of the disease, especially because asymptomatic mutation carriers may be at high risk to develop the disease and transmit it to the next generation.","Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disorder of respiratory control characterized by ventilatory impairment that results in arterial hypoxemia. This condition worse during sleep and occurs in patients with normal mechanical properties of the lung. It is diagnosed in the absence of primary neuromuscular disease, identifiable brainstem lesions, and other sleep disturbances or substance use.

Amiel et al. (2003) identified a mutation in the Phox2B gene associated with CCHS, characterized by 5 to 9 alanine expansions within a 20-residue polyalanine region in exon 3 of the Phox2B gene. Several reports confirmed the findings of Amiel et al., supporting the view that this gene is a master switch for the development of the autonomic nervous system network linked to respiratory control. Transgenic animals carrying the human Phox2B mutation develop a similar phenotype and lack glutamatergic neurons located in the parafacial region in the brainstem, which are involved in breathing control.

Although patients typically present with CCHS as newborns and rarely in later infancy, there have been reports of patients presenting with CCHS in adulthood. In cases of late-onset CCHS, most patients report having had some symptoms since childhood, and they have parents with a history of CCHS.

Adenoma is a precancerous lesion of colorectal cancer. Using colonoscopy to detect and remove the adenoma has a chance to prevent colorectal cancer development.

In the resection of colorectal polyps, for medium and large polyps that are more than one centimeter and less than two centimeters, because these polyps are at risk of cancer, they currently use hot-snaring polypectomy or more advanced endoscopic mucosal resection. Resection of such tumors ensures that a sufficient depth of resection and a high complete resection rate (R0 resection) are achieved.

Flat serrated adenoma (sessile serrated lesion) is a special adenoma that accounts for 10-12% of all colorectal polyps. Different from traditional adenomas, flat serrated adenomas within two centimeters in size have very little chance of becoming cancerous. And we know that on removal of medium and large polyps of 10-20mm, compared with the cold snaring polypectomy, the postoperative bleeding of the hot-snaring polypectomy technique is higher. Therefore, when removing low-risk polyps such as flat serrated adenomas, we may choose using a non-energized technique with low complications and we then would like to know whether the complete resection rate can be achieved by using the non-energized technique in the resection of a flat serrated adenoma of 10-20 mm, despite the large size, and compare the success rate and complications with traditional hot snaring polypectomy.","This study is a single-country, multi-center, randomized controlled study. The subjects of the case were patients who underwent colonoscopy for various indications and found flat serrated adenomas ranging in size from 10-20 mm during the procedure. Excluded criterias are patients who are younger than 20 years old and have contraindications for colonoscopy. All patients included in the study will sign the informed consent sheet at the outpatient clinic. Once a flat serrated adenoma with a size of 10-20 mm is found during colonoscopy, the subjects will be randomly assigned to Cold snaring polypectomy group, cold endoscopic mucosal resection group or hot endoscopic mucosal resection group.

The preoperative preparation for bowel cleansing and colonoscope insertion method for these three groups of patients are totally the same as those of general colonoscopy. The only difference is the resection method flat serrated glands of 10-20 mm. The tumor was resected by cold snaring polypectomy, one group was resected by cold endoscopic mucosal resection, and the other group was resected by hot endoscopic mucosal resection. The endoscopists participating in this research project have extensive experience in endoscopy and perform at least one hundred polypectomy operations every year. The excised tumor will be sent to the pathology department for pathological diagnosis, and the pathology doctor will judge the completeness of the tumor resection","Inclusion Criteria:

Adenoma is a precancerous lesion of colorectal cancer. Using colonoscopy to detect and remove the adenoma has a chance to prevent colorectal cancer development. In the resection of colorectal polyps, for medium and large polyps that are more than one centimeter and less than two centimeters, because these polyps are at risk of cancer, they currently use hot-snaring polypectomy or more advanced endoscopic mucosal resection. Resection of such tumors ensures that a sufficient depth of resection and a high complete resection rate (R0 resection) are achieved. Flat serrated adenoma (sessile serrated lesion) is a special adenoma that accounts for 10-12% of all colorectal polyps. Different from traditional adenomas, flat serrated adenomas within two centimeters in size have very little chance of becoming cancerous. And we know that on removal of medium and large polyps of 10-20mm, compared with the cold snaring polypectomy, the postoperative bleeding of the hot-snaring polypectomy technique is higher. Therefore, when removing low-risk polyps such as flat serrated adenomas, we may choose using a non-energized technique with low complications and we then would like to know whether the complete resection rate can be achieved by using the non-energized technique in the resection of a flat serrated adenoma of 10-20 mm, despite the large size, and compare the success rate and complications with traditional hot snaring polypectomy. This study is a single-country, multi-center, randomized controlled study. The subjects of the case were patients who underwent colonoscopy for various indications and found flat serrated adenomas ranging in size from 10-20 mm during the procedure. Excluded criterias are patients who are younger than 20 years old and have contraindications for colonoscopy. All patients included in the study will sign the informed consent sheet at the outpatient clinic. Once a flat serrated adenoma with a size of 10-20 mm is found during colonoscopy, the subjects will be randomly assigned to Cold snaring polypectomy group, cold endoscopic mucosal resection group or hot endoscopic mucosal resection group. The preoperative preparation for bowel cleansing and colonoscope insertion method for these three groups of patients are totally the same as those of general colonoscopy. The only difference is the resection method flat serrated glands of 10-20 mm. The tumor was resected by cold snaring polypectomy, one group was resected by cold endoscopic mucosal resection, and the other group was resected by hot endoscopic mucosal resection. The endoscopists participating in this research project have extensive experience in endoscopy and perform at least one hundred polypectomy operations every year. The excised tumor will be sent to the pathology department for pathological diagnosis, and the pathology doctor will judge the completeness of the tumor resection Inclusion Criteria: 1. Age older than 20 years old 2. Indicated for colonoscopy and willing to receive colonoscopy examination and polyp resection。 3.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),NIH,NCT04394884,Pathogenesis of BTK-mediated Hyper-Inflammatory Responses in COVID-19 (RESPOND),Pathogenesis of BTK-mediated Hyper-Inflammatory Responses in COVID-19,"Background:

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome. It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. People with severe COVID-19 infection have a hyper-inflammatory response. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays a role in the innate immune system. BTK inhibition can be used to target the innate immune system that appears to contribute to mortality. This could be an effective way to help the inflammatory responses in people with COVID-19.

Objective:

To learn more about the immunologic mechanisms by which BTK inhibition may decrease hyper-inflammatory responses in people with COVID-19.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older in one of the following groups:

* They are in the hospital with COVID-19. They will or will not be treated with a BTK inhibitor.
* They do not have COVID-19. They are or are not in the hospital. They will be treated with a BTK inhibitor for a reason other than COVID-19.

Design:

Participants will be screened with a review of their demographic and clinical information. Their medical history will be reviewed. If they have COVID-19, their symptoms will be assessed.

Participants will give 3-4 blood samples. These may be taken through a vein. They may also be taken through an existing central venous catheter.

Participants may give a stool sample. This will be collected by nursing staff. It will be collected using a stool collection vial. Stool collection is optional.

Participants samples will be collected over about 7 days. These will be used for research and genetic testing.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with a hyper-inflammatory response and evidence of innate immune cell activation. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays a central role in innate immune cell signaling and activation and BTK inhibition represents a promising therapeutic strategy for ameliorating excessive inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19. Understanding the mechanisms by which BTK inhibition modulates the host inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19 is critical in order to better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis.

In this multisite natural history laboratory study, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n=80) will be recruited at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Forty of these patients will be recipients of BTK inhibition, either as part of their standard clinical care or in another clinical trial. The other 40 will not be recipients of BTK inhibition and will serve as a control group. A third group of patients without COVID-19 (n=40) who will be recipients of BTK inhibition for other clinical indications will also be enrolled as a second control group.

Participants will have three or four longitudinal blood draws and may be asked to provide stool samples. All specimens and data will be coded and sent to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for research analysis. Only site investigators will have access to the code s key for their respective sites; the NIH investigators will not have the keys. Coded blood samples will be used for genetic testing, transcriptional analyses, deep immunological phenotyping, soluble biomarker analysis, and other research tests. Coded clinical and laboratory data from routine care (e.g., basic demographic information, vital signs, medications, clinical labs, and radiologic imaging findings) will also be captured. Coded stool samples may be collected as part of this study to determine whether viable SARS-CoV-2 is present in stool, which will help advance our understanding of pathogenesis and enteric transmission.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

The availability of recombinant gonadotropins obtained using genetically engineered techniques has meant a decisive and clear pharmacological advancement. Use of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) offers a greater effectiveness (greater number of follicles/ ovocytes and a higher pregnancy rate) and efficiency (fewer number of blisters, fewer stimulation days; fewer number of cancellations and complications) in programmed coitus and artificial insemination like in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)/intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) techniques. Further advances in obtaining better products for ovarian stimulation has led to production of a recombinant FSH (follitropin alpha) filled by mass preparation. This hormone becomes the most consistent and precise gonadotropin due to improvements in its quantification process.

Today, despite having accurate and modern tools for ovulation induction, in daily practice, doctors continue to ""fight"" against two old problems of assisted reproduction: multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Application of assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs) and the use of medication that induce ovulation, risk producing gestations and multiple births with a higher frequency than those observed in spontaneous gestations. One of the facts that result in the appearance of such problems is the high incidence of polycystic ovarian syndrome among the population of women who are infertile due to anovulation. These subjects are especially sensitive to ovarian stimulation, which leads to multiple follicular development, a higher risk of hyperstimulation and higher rates of multiple pregnancies.

Therefore, it seems clear that the search for developing mono or bifollicular cycles is important in ovarian induction cycles, for the purpose of preventing the above mentioned multiple pregnancy problems and the risk of OHSS. The intent of this study was to figure out the real mono-bifollicular development rate that is obtained under normal care conditions following OI treatment with follitropin alpha filled by mass prescribed in accordance with standard practice. Therefore, a measure of the efficiency of the product for achieving the development of one or two follicles. Data was collected from 56 centres of the Autonomous Communities that accepted this observational study, until achieving a total of 410 ovulation induction cycles.

OBJECTIVES

Primary objective:

* To find the real proportion of cycles with mono-bifollicular development during the provision of care involving OI with follitropin alpha filled by mass

Secondary objectives:

National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),NIH,NCT02225184,Impact of Delta Opioid Receptor Gene (OPRD1) Variations on Treatment Outcome in African Americans,The Impact of Delta Opioid Receptor Gene (OPRD1) Variations on Treatment Outcome in African Americans,"Background:

- Differences in peoples genes can make them respond to drugs in different ways. Methadone and buprenorphine are two drugs used to treat drug addiction. A study showed that African Americans with a certain genetic marker did better using one kind of drug treatment over the other. Researchers want to see if they can repeat these findings. They also want to study other things that affect how well people do in treatment.

Objective:

- To see if certain genetic markers and other facts about a person s life can predict how well they do in treatment for addiction to opioids and cocaine.

Eligibility:

- African American adults age 18 and over. They must be former or current participants in an Archway Treatment Clinic study. They must have been on a stable dose of either study drug for at least 12 weeks. They also must have given urine samples regularly for at least 10 weeks.

Design:

* Participants will come to the clinic for 1 visit lasting about 2 hours.
* Participants will give 1 teaspoon of blood for genetic testing. They will be asked if their sample can be used in future studies.
* If researchers cannot get enough blood, they will do a cheek swab. This will collect skin cells for genetic testing.
* Participants will fill out 3 questionnaires.
* Results of genetic testing and answers to questionnaires will be kept private.","The NIDA Clinical Trials Network s (CTN) START Study was designed to look at the pharmacogenetics of treatment response. The CTN investigators found that an intronic SNP (rs678849) in the gene for the opioid delta-1 receptor (OPRD1) strongly predicted treatment response in African-Americans. Specifically, during treatment with methadone, African-Americans with one variant of the SNP (CC) were less likely to use illicit opioids compared to African-Americans with other variants of the SNP (CT or TT) (relative risk = 0.53, 95% CI 0.46-0.60, p = 0.001). During treatment with buprenorphine, the association was reversed: African-Americans with the CC variant were more likely to use illicit opioids, compared to those with the CT or TT variants (relative risk = 2.13, 95% CI 1.81-2.45, p = 0.012). This pattern of findings was unexpected, both in terms of racial specificity and differential drug associations. Replication in a new sample is crucial to determining whether it represents a real effect.

Study objectives include: (1) To independently replicate the pharmacogenetic NIDA CTN findings by comparing urine drug screen opioid results for rs678849 genotype groups among opioid-addicted African-American individuals, treated with either buprenorphine or methadone; (2) To determine whether any effect of rs678849 genotype varies by demographic, drug use, mental health, and psychosocial characteristics; (3) To determine whether any effect of rs678849 genotype extends to cocaine use, and (4) To examine haplotype blocks in OPRD1 that might help explain the association.

We will recruit a sample of n=135 (to obtain 130 completers; 65 methadone, 65 buprenorphine) current and former participants in Archway treatment studies in order to have power of 0.80 to detect a difference of 0.5 standard deviations between rs678849 genotypes. To be eligible, participants must have received a stable dose (no taper \> 7 days in length) of buprenorphine or methadone for at least 12 weeks and had at least 10 weekly urine drug screens during that time. After informed consent, in an approximate 3-hour session, participants will undergo collection of blood or a buccal swab for DNA extraction and analysis (blood is preferred, but buccal extraction enables inclusion of participants with poor venous access) and will complete 3 questionnaires; the Addiction Severity Index, the Perceived Neighborhood Scale, and sections of the Diagnostic Instrument for Genetic Studies.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Both medications are currently used in standard practice to treat both acute and chronic pain and are options for pain management after RSE. Multiple studies exist showing ketamine to be both safe and effective for the treatment of acute pain, and to be as good as or better than opioids for this indication. The specific comparison of ketamine to fentanyl, however, has never been studied for the treatment of acute pain after rattlesnake envenomation in the United States. The investigators plan to measure pain scores after a single dose of ketamine or fentanyl in patients shortly after being envenomated, followed by continued treatment of pain guided by the treating doctor. There will be no restrictions on additional pain medications given and no other changes to the treatment of these patients during their hospitalization. This research is important because pain after RSE can be difficult to control and may require frequent, high doses of opioids for several days. An effective non-opioid medication would be helpful both to better-control pain and to reduce exposure to opioids in this patient population.

University of Illinois at Chicago,OTHER,NCT02337179,Male Circumcision Services for HIV Prevention in the Dominican Republic,A Pilot Study to Introduce Male Circumcision (MC) Services to Prevent HIV Infection in Two High Prevalence Areas of the Dominican Republic (DR),The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of introducing voluntary medical male circumcision as a form of HIV prevention in high HIV prevalence areas in the Dominican Republic.,"Voluntary Medical Male circumcision (VMMC) is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. Observational data and randomized controlled trails (RCTs) conducted in Africa(1,2,3) suggest that the procedure reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by 50-76% in heterosexual males. VMMC has also been shown to reduce the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections (STI), including herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papilloma virus (HPV) in men(4), and Chlamydia(5), trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and HPV in their female partners(6).

The results of the RCT's are generating increased demand for safe and affordable MC services in areas of moderate-to-high HIV prevalence where the MC rates are low. Latin America is a region where circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic (DR), which is the focus of this study, a 2007 nationwide household survey found that only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 were circumcised(8).

AIDS is the leading cause of death in the Caribbean basin among adults aged 15-44 years. There are approximately 240,000 people currently living with the disease, most of them residing in the Dominican Republic (DR) and Haiti(9). The prevalence of HIV infection in the DR is approximately 0.8% nationwide(8) but it is higher in selected high-risk populations, such as among people living in the ""bateyes"", the small towns surrounding sugar cane plantations, where the prevalence is 3.2%(10). In pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the Altagracia province HIV seroprevalence is 4.5 %(11). One of the areas of highest prevalence (1.2%) in the country is Region V of health, which includes the provinces of La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, La Romana and San Pedro de Macorís. Prevalence is also higher in the urban slums of the capital city, Santo Domingo.

The public health impact of introducing MC as a strategy to prevent HIV/STI transmission in areas of high HIV/STI prevalence and low MC rates can be significant. In addition to decreasing the rates of HIV and other STI, the intervention could indirectly help decrease the rates of HPV associated cervical cancer. The study proposed here is to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate pilot MC services in selected sites to assess the acceptability, uptake, safety and demand for these services, and to use these data to develop, in collaboration with the Dominican Ministry of Health (MoH), a proposal to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for support of operations research concerning the safety, uptake, and efficacy of MC interventions in the DR.

1. Specific Aims:

   Based on the results of numerous observational studies and the three RCTs the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have endorsed VMMC as a biomedical intervention for HIV prevention. As such, countries with a high prevalence of HIV in the population are encouraged to examine the feasibility of offering MC services as part of the portfolio of HIV prevention strategies at a national level. The specific aims for this project are:
   1. To develop culturally appropriate education materials about the benefits of VMMC for clients attending pilot healthcare centers.
   2. To train a core group of providers on proper surgical and counseling techniques to provide comprehensive VMMC services.
   3. To determine the acceptability, uptake and demand for MC services in key areas of high HIV prevalence.

      H1: The acceptability and uptake among high risk men will be around 60%.
   4. To assess the safety and adverse events of performing circumcision in resource constrained settings.

      H2: VMMC will result in a complication rate of less than 2%.
   5. To assess sexual risk behaviors, perceptions of sexual function and sexual pleasure in men before and after VMMC. H3: there will be no differences in risk behaviors, sexual function and pleasure after VMMC.
   6. Estimate point prevalence of most common STI in a subset of circumcised men and preserve a small sample of blood to test future scientific hypothesis and/or newer testing techniques as they become available.
   7. To build collaborations with the MoH and other partners in the DR and at UIC to develop a proposal to NIMH for operational research in the context of larger scale MC service provision.
2. Background and significance:

b.1. Male Circumcision to Prevent HIV Transmission Male circumcision is perhaps one of the oldest surgical procedures performed on humans. The millenary practice of removing the male foreskin has cultural, religious and medical dimensions that have been widely studied. Around the world, the procedure is mostly performed for religious reasons in persons of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Medical indications for MC include phimosis, paraphimosis and balanitis, among others(12). Early evidence of a relationship between MC and HIV infection came from a number of smaller, mostly observational studies, done in Africa(13). These historical data were validated with the completion of three large RCTs in South Africa, Kenya and Uganda, which have shown an overall decrease of 50-76% in the risk of acquiring HIV infection in circumcised males when compared to controls(1,2,3).

The pathogenesis of the initial infection at the level of the foreskin involves tissue macrophages, cell receptors and a moist, poorly keratinized inner prepuce. The first cellular target of the HIV virion on the human genitalia are the tissue dendritic cells in the lamina propria of the submucosa(14). These cells express surface CD4 receptors and CCR5 co-receptors for which HIV has high affinity. In intact human skin, the dendritic cells are shielded from the outer environment by the relatively thick layer of keratin covering the surface of the epithelia. Tissue studies of the human foreskin have shown that the inner lining of the prepuce, exposed during a penile erection, has a thin keratin layer that is very susceptible to microscopic abrasions and can expose the tissue macrophages making them vulnerable to infection by HIV(15).

b.2. MC for STI prevention: MC is an effective strategy to decrease the risk of infection with HIV and other STI in heterosexual males. A beneficial effect has also been observed in decreasing the risk of STI in females. The RCTs confirmed that VMMC decreases herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) acquisition by 29%, and HPV prevalence by 34% in men(4). Among female partners of circumcised men, bacterial vaginosis was reduced by 40%, and trichomonas vaginalis infection was reduced by 48%(6). Genital ulcer disease was also reduced among males and their female partners by approximately half(16).

b.3. HIV in the Caribbean and the Dominican Republic: The significant decrease in the rate of HIV acquisition observed among circumcised males who participated in the African RCT is generating an increased demand for safe and affordable VMMC services in areas of high HIV prevalence where the procedure is not routinely performed. Latin America is one of such areas where routine circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic, only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 years are circumcised(8). The Caribbean is the region of the world with the highest HIV prevalence outside of sub-Saharan Africa (1.0%)(9). Approximately 240,000 individuals are currently living with the disease. Among the Caribbean countries, the Dominican Republic and Haiti report the highest prevalence in the region. According to data from a recent In the DR, the prevalence of HIV infection is 0.8% nationwide(8), however, the numbers are higher in selected populations and in certain geographic locations.

The Dominican healthcare system is administratively divided in 9 regions, which include the country's 31 provinces. Region 0 of health includes the National District and the provinces of Santo Domingo and Monte Plata. The city of Santo Domingo is the capital and financial center of the DR. It has an estimated population of 2.7 million people spread in an area of about 1,400 KM2. 90% of the population lives in an urban setting in this province(17). The overall prevalence of HIV is around 0.7 % in the entire region but is higher in vulnerable groups such as commercial sex workers (CSW) (3.3%), Men who Have Sex with Men (MSM) (5.9%) and drug users (7.1%)(18).

Regions V and VII report the highest prevalence of HIV in the country, 1.2 % and 1.5% respectively(8). Specific populations within these provinces have rates of HIV considerably higher than the national average. For instance, prevalence is 3.2% in the bateyes, the small communities surrounding sugar cane plantations, where a mixed population of Dominicans and Haitian migrant workers cohabitate. Our team has conducted preliminary studies in the Altagracia Province, part of Region V, since it reports the highest province-specific HIV rates and the lowest circumcision rates in the country. A survey of pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the province found an HIV seroprevalence of 4.5 %11. The prevalence of HIV is 5.2% in CSW, 7.6% in MSM and 8.5 % among drug users(18).

c) Preliminary studies: The parent study for this project is a RCT of VMMC to reduce HIV incidence in Kisumu, Kenya whose principal investigator is Prof. Robert C. Bailey, a co-investigator in the current proposal(3). The main objective of that trial was to assess the effectiveness of VMMC in reducing HIV incidence in young, sexually active men. The protective effect found in an intent-to-treat analysis was 53% and in an as treated analysis adjusting for cross-overs and men found to be HIV seropositive at baseline estimated the protective effect to be 60%. Adverse events related to the surgical procedure were few, just 1.5%. Behavioral disinhibition (risk compensation) on the part of circumcised men was small and not significant.

Drs. Brito and Bailey conducted a feasibility study of healthcare facilities in the Altagracia province in the Dominican Republic during June and July of 2007. A total of 37 healthcare facilities were surveyed. The study found that most facilities lacked appropriate equipment to perform surgical procedures and only four (11%) had a surgical theater. 43 healthcare workers, the majority of them physicians (91%), were interviewed for the study. Only 23 % of the personnel had experience performing MC and a significant number of providers (76%) believed they needed comprehensive training in the procedure prior to starting a MC program. Quantitative and qualitative studies to assess the acceptability of MC among men, women and providers in the Altagracia Province were conducted in 2008. In these studies, 73% of men thought that MC improved hygiene and approximately one third knew that it reduces the risk of penile cancer or STI. Only a small percentage (21%) knew that MC helps prevent HIV infection. When first asked, 29% of participants reported that they would be willing to be circumcised if the procedure was offered to them. However, after an educational session detailing the benefits of the procedure for HIV and STI prevention, the acceptability increased to 67%. Such increment was also observed in previous studies done in Botswana(19) and Thailand(20)where acceptability increased from 61 % to 81% and from 14% to 66%, respectively, after a similar information session. In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of men's acceptability of circumcision, before the information session, were Haitian nationality (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.41), thinking that circumcision improves hygiene (OR=2.78, 95% CI 1.29-6.0) and not believing that having a circumcision decreases sexual pleasure (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.20-3.94). These results have been published (21, 22).

We also conducted 13 focus group discussions (FGD), 6 with women and 7 with men, each consisting of 6-10 participants (mean=7.9, SD=1.3). One additional FGD was conducted with six physicians, two males and four females, working in rural clinics around the province. Findings of this qualitative study showed that a significant number of participants might be willing to be circumcised, or agree with circumcision for their partners, to improve hygiene, prevent diseases and treat medical conditions, such as phimosis, which can result in pain during intercourse. These results are consistent with our quantitative study on men's acceptability of MC. Perhaps one of the most important findings of the FGD was the enthusiastic endorsement of MC by women, a fact that has potential implications for the successful implementation of a circumcision program in the country (22).

Overall, our preliminary data suggest that men are willing to be circumcised provided they receive information about the benefits of the procedure. Before recommending the introduction of VMMC services as part of a comprehensive package of HIV and other STI prevention strategies, these findings need to be confirmed by studying the uptake of VMMC among sexually active men in selected clinics that serve clients in high prevalence areas. In addition, there is need to identify potential barriers to offering MC services in high risk communities prior to proposing to implement a large-scale intervention. In order to properly address these concerns, we will conduct a pilot study that will provide the necessary preliminary data to design a proposal to the NIMH to conduct operational research around a large-scale implementation project.

d) Experimental design and methods: d.1. Pilot study design The study will be conducted at two sites: the STI clinic at Instituto Dermatologico and Cirugia de Piel (IDCP) in Santo Domingo and the Clínica de Familia in La Romana, Dominican Republic. These sites have been selected on the basis of: 1) high numbers of male clients at risk for HIV and STI infection in communities served by the clinics; 2) high level of acceptability of MC among men in the communities served by the clinics (bateyes of Altagracia); 3) the availability of service providers willing to be trained; 4) the availability of equipment; and 5) the availability of infrastructure, including a minor surgical theater, sterilization facilities and HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and STI management.

During the first phase of the study, culturally appropriate educational material will be created in Spanish by the principal investigator and local collaborators. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews will be conducted with members of the community to learn the educational needs of the community and to assess their opinions on how to best deliver the information on MC that will be contained in the educational materials.

We plan to conduct the FGD in the communities served by the Instituto Dermatologico and the Clinica de Familia, the two main study sites. The plan is to assemble groups of 6-12 participants from the population living in these communities. Community leaders, health promoters, teachers and primary care physicians will be asked to help identify and invite volunteers from their respective communities to participate in the study. There will be no difference in the recruitment process for men and women. They will be recruited from the same venues (schools, clubs, community centers) . Participants will be invited to participate by research personnel with the help of local leaders. These local leaders may be of both genders and will help recruit participants from either gender. The focus groups will be gender-specific. The moderator will explain the purpose of the study to participants. Verbal consent will be obtained from all participants and an information sheet outlining the objectives of the study, their privacy and confidentiality rights and our contact information will be distributed. The document will highlight the voluntary nature of the subject's participation and their right to leave the discussion at anytime if they so desire. The study meets the definition of ""minimal risk"", therefore, we are requesting a waiver of written consent. We believe this will further preserve the confidentiality of the participants. The goal is to conduct no more than 15 FGD. Participants in the FGD will be divided by gender. We plan to recruit approximately the same number of men and women for the FGD.

In addition to the FGD, several in-depth individual interviews may be conducted using the same guide than in the FGD. A script will be followed to conduct the FGD. The discussions will be stimulated by using a list of carefully crafted questions on the subject of MC. These questions are designed to obtain information on the following aspects relevant to our investigation:

1. Perception of the population about the frequency of MC in community men.
2. Opinions on the best way to educate men in the community about the benefits of circumcision.
3. Opinions about the content of the educational materials educational and how information should be delivered.
4. Where should these educational material be posted or distributed to capture the most number of men.
5. Opinions on the best venue to organize educational sessions featuring a circumcised man that would be available to answer question from men in the community about his satisfaction with his circumcision.
6. Perceptions about who would be a good person to educate men about the benefits of circumcision in the community.
7. Opinions on the best way to involve women in the community in a campaign to recruit men for circumcision.

The moderator and a research assistant (RA) will lead the discussions. All FGD will be audiotaped and detailed notes will be taken. The content of the recordings will be transcribed shortly after the end of the meeting. The PI, a native Spanish speaker, will be responsible for translating the recordings from Spanish to English. The English-version transcripts will be coded using the program ATLAS.ti vers. 5.2 based on template of topical categories drawn from questions and issues covered in the discussion guides and from themes emerging from the discussions themselves. The interviews will be conducted by one of the co-investigators. Verbal consent will be obtained and a document containing information about the study will be provided to the participants. All data obtained during this study, including recordings and notes will be de-indentified. The names of the participants will not be recorded to protect their confidentiality.

Data Management All notes, audio recordings and study material obtained during the FGD and interviews will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in an office at the Instituto Dermatologico, Dominican Republic and in the PI's office at the UIC campus upon the investigator's return to Chicago. All data will be de-identified to preserve confidentiality. Names will not be recorded. Verbal informed consent will be sought; there will be no signed consent forms to identify individuals. The participants have the right to review the audio recordings. If a participant requests to listen to the recordings, one of the co-investigators will schedule an appointment for the subject to come to the research site and, in an unoccupied office, will playback the recording for him/her and answer all the questions that the subject may have. If the participant wishes to erase part or all of his/her responses, it will be done on the spot, in his/her presence, using the digital recorder. The data obtained during these FGD and interviews will inform the design of the educational materials. Once created, these materials will be tested for clarity and appropriateness of language by soliciting input from community health promoters and peer advocates working at the IDCP. Once it is determined that the educational materials are suitable to distribute to clients, we will submit to the Institutional Review Board for approval. Once approved, pamphlets and posters will be printed and distributed at the site clinics and the surrounding communities.

During the second phase, selected providers will be trained. This will include counselors in HIV counseling and testing, and medical doctors by an experienced urologist on the appropriate technique for VMMC using the ""Manual for Male Circumcision Under Local Anesthesia"" published by WHO, UNAIDS. Supervision and evaluation of trainees will be conducted following the protocol used during the parent RCT.

Study subjects will be recruited in a variety of ways. In Santo Domingo, fliers will be posted in bars and night clubs frequented by men at high risk for HIV/STI acquisition. A group of volunteer commercial sex workers working on an HIV vaccine trial will be asked to refer their clients for the study. Men seeking care for STI at the clinic will also be invited to participate. In La Romana, men attending the Clínica de Familia will be invited to participate. In addition, a group of outreach workers will visit the ""bateyes"", the communities surrounding sugar cane fields where migrant laborers live, to educate men about MC and invite them to participate in the study.

Men between 18-40 years will be provided with information about the study and will be invited to participate. If they express an interest in participating, informed consent will be obtained. The participant will go over the consent form with the counselor, who will assess his level of understanding and answer any questions. If there are no temporary or permanent excluding conditions, the participant will be asked to give informed consent for enrollment in the study. Men who elect to be circumcised will be fully informed about the benefits and risks of the procedure, as well as the surgical method to be used. After the informed consent is signed, a ""Locator Information Form"" containing confidential data such as subject's name and address will be completed. Only selected research staff will have access to this information, which will be filed separate from the rest of the study forms. A de-identified ""demographic information form and behavioral questionnaire"" will be completed next.

Testing for HIV infection will be carried out using a rapid test. The test kits to be used are the synthetic peptide test, Determine HIV 1/2, and the recombinant antigen test Unigold HIV 1/2 Recombinant. Results are provided to the clients, with appropriate counseling, at the same visit. Participants are taught to observe, read and interpret the tests for themselves in the company of the counselor. Men with positive results will be informed of their HIV status and will be followed-up at the study clinic and referred for a confirmatory HIV-ELISA and, if confirmed, for HIV treatment. Serologic testing for HSV-2, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV), and hepatitis C antibody (HCV) will be performed using an ELISA test. A serum Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR) will be performed to test for syphilis. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing will be performed in urine using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. All participants who test positive for Chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea will be offered treatment free of charge. Participants who test positive for HSV-2 and have active genital lesions will be offered treatment free of charge. Those who test positive but have no active lesions will be counseled on safe sex practices and the risk of transmission to their partners as there is no recommended treatment for asymptomatic individuals infected with HSV-2. HIV, HBV, and HCV positive participants will be referred for evaluation and treatment at Clinica de la Familia in La Romana as these are chronic diseases that require long term treatment usually covered under government programs. If a participant is found to have a treatable STD and he does not return to the site, he will be called by the study investigators using the phone number provided by the participant at enrolment to ensure treatment is provided. If there is a temporary, medically curable condition present, such that it would be advisable to defer potential surgery, then the participant will be treated and asked to return for re-evaluation for study eligibility when he is cured. Men found to have an STD or to be HIV-positive will be referred for immediate care. Once enrollment is completed, participants will be given an appointment for the surgery.

Circumcision will be performed soon after informed consent, preferably within a few days. All surgeries will be done under local anesthesia in a clinic by trained clinicians, using the standardized forceps-guided method described by Krieger and colleagues and contained in the WHO MC manual(23). Circumcised men will be counseled to refrain from sex for six weeks post-surgery and counseled about risk of HIV infection through open wounds during the healing process. They will be checked for complications and asked about their sexual activity seven days after the procedure. Men without complications will be followed six months after surgery with behavioral risk assessment, HIV testing and counseling. Men may come to the study sites for unscheduled visits at any time during the 6 month follow-up. All men will be counseled at enrollment and all follow-up visits to reduce their risk for HIV infection by consistent condom use and, where applicable, reductions in numbers of sex partners. Counselling on condom use and sexual risk reduction will be provided by trained, experienced, native-speaking counsellors.

MC services will be offered at the selected two sites for 1 year. The estimated cost per circumcision is $40. We expect to recruit five clients per week at each site for a total convenience sample of 575 subjects in one year. During the second year of the project, we will continue to assess behavioral risk factors for the first six months and work on analyzing the data during the last semester of the project.

Circumcision Procedure Prior to surgery, the clinician will obtain a complete medical history and perform a physical exam.

A brief description of the procedure follows. The patient lies on his back in a comfortable position. The pubic area is shaved clean with a disposable razor and the hair is picked up with a dressing tape. The surgeon scrubs up and puts on 2 pairs of sterile gloves. The client's skin is prepared with Betadine solution, making sure that the inner surface of the prepuce and the glans are clean and the skin is dry. The outer pair of gloves is then removed. The client is draped with two drapes and a center ""O"" towel, and then, using 2% lidocaine without epinephrine, a dorsal nerve block and a field block with special attention to the ventral nerve, is performed. Normally, no more than 10ml of 2% lidocaine will be used. The anesthetic effect of the nerve block is checked, and revised if necessary. The prepuce is held with two mosquito forceps, one on each lateral aspect, then a curved mark is made with sterile disposable marking pens, outlining the planned surgical cut. The mark is made one cm proximal to the coronal sulcus all round, and parallel to the coronal sulcus. The prepuce is clamped along the mark with a Kocher clamp while retracting the glans, ensuring that the glans itself is not clamped. The prepuce is excised using a surgical blade along the mark. Bleeders are identified, clamped and tied. They are sutured, and if necessary ligated, using 3/0 plain catgut. After ligating all the bleeders, the area is irrigated with normal saline and then inspected for more bleeders, which are identified and tied. Using 3/0 chromic catgut on a taper 4/8 circle needle, a U-shaped horizontal mattress stitch is made on the ventral side of the penis (frenulum) to join the skin at the ""V"" shaped cut, which is then tied and tagged with a mosquito forceps. Using vertical mattress stitches, four quarters are tagged, and a vertical mattress stitch added, after which a simple stitch is put at the center of every two mattress stitches (a total of at least 16 stitches). The area is irrigated with normal saline and other simple stitches added as required. The wound is dressed with Sofratulle, then with a regular dressing bandage and a strapping. The client is advised to rest for 30 minutes, and if stable, discharged home on mild analgesics. Upon completion of the procedure the surgeon completes a procedure form. The excised foreskin tissue is taken to the laboratory with no identifiers, discarded with other laboratory waste, and incinerated with other biological waste within three days. Participants will be given verbal and written instructions on postoperative wound care and counseled to refrain from sexual activity for at least six weeks after the procedure. They will also be encouraged to come to the clinic or contact a clinician at any time with medical problems.

Day 7 Post Circumcision Visit: Circumcised men will be asked to return to the clinic 7 days after the procedure to check the wound, to see if it is healing properly, to check for complications, and to ask about their sexual activity, their level of pain, resumption of work or other activities, and their satisfaction with the procedure and care at the clinic. As with all visits, any adverse events will be recorded. Blood and urine will be collected for STD testing at this visit.

Six month post operative visit: During this visit a brief exam to confirmed proper wound healing will be performed. A behavioral and satisfaction questionnaire will be administered.

Unscheduled Follow-up Visits: Ad hoc clinic visits will be encouraged to check and treat for complications of the procedure. At such visits, medical examinations and laboratory testing will be conducted as indicated, and appropriate treatment provided free of charge. Medical referral will be made if required.

d.2. Data analysis Each enrolled participant will be assigned a confidential code, which will be used in all study forms. Only the principal investigators and research assistants will have access to the ""locator information form"" containing personal information. This form, which links the subject's confidential code to his name, will be stored in separate locked filing cabinets at the local principal investigator's offices. The locator information forms, which contain the personal information on the subjects, will be kept for 1.5 years in case we need to contact one of the subjects for an unexpected occurrence or with a question. After the end of that period, these locator forms will be destroyed at the research offices at the respective study sites using a micro cut shredder. Data will be coded and entered into computer datasets by trained personnel. Data extracted from questionnaires will be tabulated and analyzed using SAS statistical software version 9.1. and will be analyzed at the University of Illinois, College of Medicine, in Chicago by the principal investigator A questionnaire asking specific demographic information will be administered. The following variables will be recorded: age, religion, place of residence (urban/rural), education level, occupation and marital status. Simple descriptive statistics will be calculated and the effect of these variables on the willingness, uptake and rate of adverse events of VMMC will be estimated. In addition, we plan to estimate the effect of demographic characteristics on sexual behavior and disinhibition after the procedure.","Inclusion Criteria:

Voluntary Medical Male circumcision (VMMC) is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. Observational data and randomized controlled trails (RCTs) conducted in Africa(1,2,3) suggest that the procedure reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by 50-76% in heterosexual males. VMMC has also been shown to reduce the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections (STI), including herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human papilloma virus (HPV) in men(4), and Chlamydia(5), trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and HPV in their female partners(6). The results of the RCT's are generating increased demand for safe and affordable MC services in areas of moderate-to-high HIV prevalence where the MC rates are low. Latin America is a region where circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic (DR), which is the focus of this study, a 2007 nationwide household survey found that only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 were circumcised(8). AIDS is the leading cause of death in the Caribbean basin among adults aged 15-44 years. There are approximately 240,000 people currently living with the disease, most of them residing in the Dominican Republic (DR) and Haiti(9). The prevalence of HIV infection in the DR is approximately 0.8% nationwide(8) but it is higher in selected high-risk populations, such as among people living in the ""bateyes"", the small towns surrounding sugar cane plantations, where the prevalence is 3.2%(10). In pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the Altagracia province HIV seroprevalence is 4.5 %(11). One of the areas of highest prevalence (1.2%) in the country is Region V of health, which includes the provinces of La Altagracia, El Seibo, Hato Mayor, La Romana and San Pedro de Macorís. Prevalence is also higher in the urban slums of the capital city, Santo Domingo. The public health impact of introducing MC as a strategy to prevent HIV/STI transmission in areas of high HIV/STI prevalence and low MC rates can be significant. In addition to decreasing the rates of HIV and other STI, the intervention could indirectly help decrease the rates of HPV associated cervical cancer. The study proposed here is to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate pilot MC services in selected sites to assess the acceptability, uptake, safety and demand for these services, and to use these data to develop, in collaboration with the Dominican Ministry of Health (MoH), a proposal to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for support of operations research concerning the safety, uptake, and efficacy of MC interventions in the DR. 1. Specific Aims: Based on the results of numerous observational studies and the three RCTs the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have endorsed VMMC as a biomedical intervention for HIV prevention. As such, countries with a high prevalence of HIV in the population are encouraged to examine the feasibility of offering MC services as part of the portfolio of HIV prevention strategies at a national level. The specific aims for this project are: 1. To develop culturally appropriate education materials about the benefits of VMMC for clients attending pilot healthcare centers. 2. To train a core group of providers on proper surgical and counseling techniques to provide comprehensive VMMC services. 3. To determine the acceptability, uptake and demand for MC services in key areas of high HIV prevalence. H1: The acceptability and uptake among high risk men will be around 60%. 4. To assess the safety and adverse events of performing circumcision in resource constrained settings. H2: VMMC will result in a complication rate of less than 2%. 5. To assess sexual risk behaviors, perceptions of sexual function and sexual pleasure in men before and after VMMC. H3: there will be no differences in risk behaviors, sexual function and pleasure after VMMC. 6. Estimate point prevalence of most common STI in a subset of circumcised men and preserve a small sample of blood to test future scientific hypothesis and/or newer testing techniques as they become available. 7. To build collaborations with the MoH and other partners in the DR and at UIC to develop a proposal to NIMH for operational research in the context of larger scale MC service provision. 2. Background and significance: b.1. Male Circumcision to Prevent HIV Transmission Male circumcision is perhaps one of the oldest surgical procedures performed on humans. The millenary practice of removing the male foreskin has cultural, religious and medical dimensions that have been widely studied. Around the world, the procedure is mostly performed for religious reasons in persons of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Medical indications for MC include phimosis, paraphimosis and balanitis, among others(12). Early evidence of a relationship between MC and HIV infection came from a number of smaller, mostly observational studies, done in Africa(13). These historical data were validated with the completion of three large RCTs in South Africa, Kenya and Uganda, which have shown an overall decrease of 50-76% in the risk of acquiring HIV infection in circumcised males when compared to controls(1,2,3). The pathogenesis of the initial infection at the level of the foreskin involves tissue macrophages, cell receptors and a moist, poorly keratinized inner prepuce. The first cellular target of the HIV virion on the human genitalia are the tissue dendritic cells in the lamina propria of the submucosa(14). These cells express surface CD4 receptors and CCR5 co-receptors for which HIV has high affinity. In intact human skin, the dendritic cells are shielded from the outer environment by the relatively thick layer of keratin covering the surface of the epithelia. Tissue studies of the human foreskin have shown that the inner lining of the prepuce, exposed during a penile erection, has a thin keratin layer that is very susceptible to microscopic abrasions and can expose the tissue macrophages making them vulnerable to infection by HIV(15). b.2. MC for STI prevention: MC is an effective strategy to decrease the risk of infection with HIV and other STI in heterosexual males. A beneficial effect has also been observed in decreasing the risk of STI in females. The RCTs confirmed that VMMC decreases herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) acquisition by 29%, and HPV prevalence by 34% in men(4). Among female partners of circumcised men, bacterial vaginosis was reduced by 40%, and trichomonas vaginalis infection was reduced by 48%(6). Genital ulcer disease was also reduced among males and their female partners by approximately half(16). b.3. HIV in the Caribbean and the Dominican Republic: The significant decrease in the rate of HIV acquisition observed among circumcised males who participated in the African RCT is generating an increased demand for safe and affordable VMMC services in areas of high HIV prevalence where the procedure is not routinely performed. Latin America is one of such areas where routine circumcision of males is uncommon(7). In the Dominican Republic, only 13.7% of men between the ages of 15-59 years are circumcised(8). The Caribbean is the region of the world with the highest HIV prevalence outside of sub-Saharan Africa (1.0%)(9). Approximately 240,000 individuals are currently living with the disease. Among the Caribbean countries, the Dominican Republic and Haiti report the highest prevalence in the region. According to data from a recent In the DR, the prevalence of HIV infection is 0.8% nationwide(8), however, the numbers are higher in selected populations and in certain geographic locations. The Dominican healthcare system is administratively divided in 9 regions, which include the country's 31 provinces. Region 0 of health includes the National District and the provinces of Santo Domingo and Monte Plata. The city of Santo Domingo is the capital and financial center of the DR. It has an estimated population of 2.7 million people spread in an area of about 1,400 KM2. 90% of the population lives in an urban setting in this province(17). The overall prevalence of HIV is around 0.7 % in the entire region but is higher in vulnerable groups such as commercial sex workers (CSW) (3.3%), Men who Have Sex with Men (MSM) (5.9%) and drug users (7.1%)(18). Regions V and VII report the highest prevalence of HIV in the country, 1.2 % and 1.5% respectively(8). Specific populations within these provinces have rates of HIV considerably higher than the national average. For instance, prevalence is 3.2% in the bateyes, the small communities surrounding sugar cane plantations, where a mixed population of Dominicans and Haitian migrant workers cohabitate. Our team has conducted preliminary studies in the Altagracia Province, part of Region V, since it reports the highest province-specific HIV rates and the lowest circumcision rates in the country. A survey of pregnant women seeking prenatal care at the main hospital in the province found an HIV seroprevalence of 4.5 %11. The prevalence of HIV is 5.2% in CSW, 7.6% in MSM and 8.5 % among drug users(18). c) Preliminary studies: The parent study for this project is a RCT of VMMC to reduce HIV incidence in Kisumu, Kenya whose principal investigator is Prof. Robert C. Bailey, a co-investigator in the current proposal(3). The main objective of that trial was to assess the effectiveness of VMMC in reducing HIV incidence in young, sexually active men. The protective effect found in an intent-to-treat analysis was 53% and in an as treated analysis adjusting for cross-overs and men found to be HIV seropositive at baseline estimated the protective effect to be 60%. Adverse events related to the surgical procedure were few, just 1.5%. Behavioral disinhibition (risk compensation) on the part of circumcised men was small and not significant. Drs. Brito and Bailey conducted a feasibility study of healthcare facilities in the Altagracia province in the Dominican Republic during June and July of 2007. A total of 37 healthcare facilities were surveyed. The study found that most facilities lacked appropriate equipment to perform surgical procedures and only four (11%) had a surgical theater. 43 healthcare workers, the majority of them physicians (91%), were interviewed for the study. Only 23 % of the personnel had experience performing MC and a significant number of providers (76%) believed they needed comprehensive training in the procedure prior to starting a MC program. Quantitative and qualitative studies to assess the acceptability of MC among men, women and providers in the Altagracia Province were conducted in 2008. In these studies, 73% of men thought that MC improved hygiene and approximately one third knew that it reduces the risk of penile cancer or STI. Only a small percentage (21%) knew that MC helps prevent HIV infection. When first asked, 29% of participants reported that they would be willing to be circumcised if the procedure was offered to them. However, after an educational session detailing the benefits of the procedure for HIV and STI prevention, the acceptability increased to 67%. Such increment was also observed in previous studies done in Botswana(19) and Thailand(20)where acceptability increased from 61 % to 81% and from 14% to 66%, respectively, after a similar information session. In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of men's acceptability of circumcision, before the information session, were Haitian nationality (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.41), thinking that circumcision improves hygiene (OR=2.78, 95% CI 1.29-6.0) and not believing that having a circumcision decreases sexual pleasure (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.20-3.94). These results have been published (21, 22). We also conducted 13 focus group discussions (FGD), 6 with women and 7 with men, each consisting of 6-10 participants (mean=7.9, SD=1.3). One additional FGD was conducted with six physicians, two males and four females, working in rural clinics around the province. Findings of this qualitative study showed that a significant number of participants might be willing to be circumcised, or agree with circumcision for their partners, to improve hygiene, prevent diseases and treat medical conditions, such as phimosis, which can result in pain during intercourse. These results are consistent with our quantitative study on men's acceptability of MC. Perhaps one of the most important findings of the FGD was the enthusiastic endorsement of MC by women, a fact that has potential implications for the successful implementation of a circumcision program in the country (22). Overall, our preliminary data suggest that men are willing to be circumcised provided they receive information about the benefits of the procedure. Before recommending the introduction of VMMC services as part of a comprehensive package of HIV and other STI prevention strategies, these findings need to be confirmed by studying the uptake of VMMC among sexually active men in selected clinics that serve clients in high prevalence areas. In addition, there is need to identify potential barriers to offering MC services in high risk communities prior to proposing to implement a large-scale intervention. In order to properly address these concerns, we will conduct a pilot study that will provide the necessary preliminary data to design a proposal to the NIMH to conduct operational research around a large-scale implementation project. d) Experimental design and methods: d.1. Pilot study design The study will be conducted at two sites: the STI clinic at Instituto Dermatologico and Cirugia de Piel (IDCP) in Santo Domingo and the Clínica de Familia in La Romana, Dominican Republic. These sites have been selected on the basis of: 1) high numbers of male clients at risk for HIV and STI infection in communities served by the clinics; 2) high level of acceptability of MC among men in the communities served by the clinics (bateyes of Altagracia); 3) the availability of service providers willing to be trained; 4) the availability of equipment; and 5) the availability of infrastructure, including a minor surgical theater, sterilization facilities and HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and STI management. During the first phase of the study, culturally appropriate educational material will be created in Spanish by the principal investigator and local collaborators. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews will be conducted with members of the community to learn the educational needs of the community and to assess their opinions on how to best deliver the information on MC that will be contained in the educational materials. We plan to conduct the FGD in the communities served by the Instituto Dermatologico and the Clinica de Familia, the two main study sites. The plan is to assemble groups of 6-12 participants from the population living in these communities. Community leaders, health promoters, teachers and primary care physicians will be asked to help identify and invite volunteers from their respective communities to participate in the study. There will be no difference in the recruitment process for men and women. They will be recruited from the same venues (schools, clubs, community centers) . Participants will be invited to participate by research personnel with the help of local leaders. These local leaders may be of both genders and will help recruit participants from either gender. The focus groups will be gender-specific. The moderator will explain the purpose of the study to participants. Verbal consent will be obtained from all participants and an information sheet outlining the objectives of the study, their privacy and confidentiality rights and our contact information will be distributed. The document will highlight the voluntary nature of the subject's participation and their right to leave the discussion at anytime if they so desire. The study meets the definition of ""minimal risk"", therefore, we are requesting a waiver of written consent. We believe this will further preserve the confidentiality of the participants. The goal is to conduct no more than 15 FGD. Participants in the FGD will be divided by gender. We plan to recruit approximately the same number of men and women for the FGD. In addition to the FGD, several in-depth individual interviews may be conducted using the same guide than in the FGD. A script will be followed to conduct the FGD. The discussions will be stimulated by using a list of carefully crafted questions on the subject of MC. These questions are designed to obtain information on the following aspects relevant to our investigation: 1. Perception of the population about the frequency of MC in community men. 2. Opinions on the best way to educate men in the community about the benefits of circumcision. 3. Opinions about the content of the educational materials educational and how information should be delivered. 4. Where should these educational material be posted or distributed to capture the most number of men. 5. Opinions on the best venue to organize educational sessions featuring a circumcised man that would be available to answer question from men in the community about his satisfaction with his circumcision. 6. Perceptions about who would be a good person to educate men about the benefits of circumcision in the community. 7. Opinions on the best way to involve women in the community in a campaign to recruit men for circumcision. The moderator and a research assistant (RA) will lead the discussions. All FGD will be audiotaped and detailed notes will be taken. The content of the recordings will be transcribed shortly after the end of the meeting. The PI, a native Spanish speaker, will be responsible for translating the recordings from Spanish to English. The English-version transcripts will be coded using the program ATLAS.ti vers. 5.2 based on template of topical categories drawn from questions and issues covered in the discussion guides and from themes emerging from the discussions themselves. The interviews will be conducted by one of the co-investigators. Verbal consent will be obtained and a document containing information about the study will be provided to the participants. All data obtained during this study, including recordings and notes will be de-indentified. The names of the participants will not be recorded to protect their confidentiality. Data Management All notes, audio recordings and study material obtained during the FGD and interviews will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in an office at the Instituto Dermatologico, Dominican Republic and in the PI's office at the UIC campus upon the investigator's return to Chicago. All data will be de-identified to preserve confidentiality. Names will not be recorded. Verbal informed consent will be sought; there will be no signed consent forms to identify individuals. The participants have the right to review the audio recordings. If a participant requests to listen to the recordings, one of the co-investigators will schedule an appointment for the subject to come to the research site and, in an unoccupied office, will playback the recording for him/her and answer all the questions that the subject may have. If the participant wishes to erase part or all of his/her responses, it will be done on the spot, in his/her presence, using the digital recorder. The data obtained during these FGD and interviews will inform the design of the educational materials. Once created, these materials will be tested for clarity and appropriateness of language by soliciting input from community health promoters and peer advocates working at the IDCP. Once it is determined that the educational materials are suitable to distribute to clients, we will submit to the Institutional Review Board for approval. Once approved, pamphlets and posters will be printed and distributed at the site clinics and the surrounding communities. During the second phase, selected providers will be trained. This will include counselors in HIV counseling and testing, and medical doctors by an experienced urologist on the appropriate technique for VMMC using the ""Manual for Male Circumcision Under Local Anesthesia"" published by WHO, UNAIDS. Supervision and evaluation of trainees will be conducted following the protocol used during the parent RCT. Study subjects will be recruited in a variety of ways. In Santo Domingo, fliers will be posted in bars and night clubs frequented by men at high risk for HIV/STI acquisition. A group of volunteer commercial sex workers working on an HIV vaccine trial will be asked to refer their clients for the study. Men seeking care for STI at the clinic will also be invited to participate. In La Romana, men attending the Clínica de Familia will be invited to participate. In addition, a group of outreach workers will visit the ""bateyes"", the communities surrounding sugar cane fields where migrant laborers live, to educate men about MC and invite them to participate in the study. Men between 18-40 years will be provided with information about the study and will be invited to participate. If they express an interest in participating, informed consent will be obtained. The participant will go over the consent form with the counselor, who will assess his level of understanding and answer any questions. If there are no temporary or permanent excluding conditions, the participant will be asked to give informed consent for enrollment in the study. Men who elect to be circumcised will be fully informed about the benefits and risks of the procedure, as well as the surgical method to be used. After the informed consent is signed, a ""Locator Information Form"" containing confidential data such as subject's name and address will be completed. Only selected research staff will have access to this information, which will be filed separate from the rest of the study forms. A de-identified ""demographic information form and behavioral questionnaire"" will be completed next. Testing for HIV infection will be carried out using a rapid test. The test kits to be used are the synthetic peptide test, Determine HIV 1/2, and the recombinant antigen test Unigold HIV 1/2 Recombinant. Results are provided to the clients, with appropriate counseling, at the same visit. Participants are taught to observe, read and interpret the tests for themselves in the company of the counselor. Men with positive results will be informed of their HIV status and will be followed-up at the study clinic and referred for a confirmatory HIV-ELISA and, if confirmed, for HIV treatment. Serologic testing for HSV-2, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV), and hepatitis C antibody (HCV) will be performed using an ELISA test. A serum Rapid Plasma Reagin test (RPR) will be performed to test for syphilis. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing will be performed in urine using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. All participants who test positive for Chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea will be offered treatment free of charge. Participants who test positive for HSV-2 and have active genital lesions will be offered treatment free of charge. Those who test positive but have no active lesions will be counseled on safe sex practices and the risk of transmission to their partners as there is no recommended treatment for asymptomatic individuals infected with HSV-2. HIV, HBV, and HCV positive participants will be referred for evaluation and treatment at Clinica de la Familia in La Romana as these are chronic diseases that require long term treatment usually covered under government programs. If a participant is found to have a treatable STD and he does not return to the site, he will be called by the study investigators using the phone number provided by the participant at enrolment to ensure treatment is provided. If there is a temporary, medically curable condition present, such that it would be advisable to defer potential surgery, then the participant will be treated and asked to return for re-evaluation for study eligibility when he is cured. Men found to have an STD or to be HIV-positive will be referred for immediate care. Once enrollment is completed, participants will be given an appointment for the surgery. Circumcision will be performed soon after informed consent, preferably within a few days. All surgeries will be done under local anesthesia in a clinic by trained clinicians, using the standardized forceps-guided method described by Krieger and colleagues and contained in the WHO MC manual(23). Circumcised men will be counseled to refrain from sex for six weeks post-surgery and counseled about risk of HIV infection through open wounds during the healing process. They will be checked for complications and asked about their sexual activity seven days after the procedure. Men without complications will be followed six months after surgery with behavioral risk assessment, HIV testing and counseling. Men may come to the study sites for unscheduled visits at any time during the 6 month follow-up. All men will be counseled at enrollment and all follow-up visits to reduce their risk for HIV infection by consistent condom use and, where applicable, reductions in numbers of sex partners. Counselling on condom use and sexual risk reduction will be provided by trained, experienced, native-speaking counsellors. MC services will be offered at the selected two sites for 1 year. The estimated cost per circumcision is $40. We expect to recruit five clients per week at each site for a total convenience sample of 575 subjects in one year. During the second year of the project, we will continue to assess behavioral risk factors for the first six months and work on analyzing the data during the last semester of the project. Circumcision Procedure Prior to surgery, the clinician will obtain a complete medical history and perform a physical exam. A brief description of the procedure follows. The patient lies on his back in a comfortable position. The pubic area is shaved clean with a disposable razor and the hair is picked up with a dressing tape. The surgeon scrubs up and puts on 2 pairs of sterile gloves. The client's skin is prepared with Betadine solution, making sure that the inner surface of the prepuce and the glans are clean and the skin is dry. The outer pair of gloves is then removed. The client is draped with two drapes and a center ""O"" towel, and then, using 2% lidocaine without epinephrine, a dorsal nerve block and a field block with special attention to the ventral nerve, is performed. Normally, no more than 10ml of 2% lidocaine will be used. The anesthetic effect of the nerve block is checked, and revised if necessary. The prepuce is held with two mosquito forceps, one on each lateral aspect, then a curved mark is made with sterile disposable marking pens, outlining the planned surgical cut. The mark is made one cm proximal to the coronal sulcus all round, and parallel to the coronal sulcus. The prepuce is clamped along the mark with a Kocher clamp while retracting the glans, ensuring that the glans itself is not clamped. The prepuce is excised using a surgical blade along the mark. Bleeders are identified, clamped and tied. They are sutured, and if necessary ligated, using 3/0 plain catgut. After ligating all the bleeders, the area is irrigated with normal saline and then inspected for more bleeders, which are identified and tied. Using 3/0 chromic catgut on a taper 4/8 circle needle, a U-shaped horizontal mattress stitch is made on the ventral side of the penis (frenulum) to join the skin at the ""V"" shaped cut, which is then tied and tagged with a mosquito forceps. Using vertical mattress stitches, four quarters are tagged, and a vertical mattress stitch added, after which a simple stitch is put at the center of every two mattress stitches (a total of at least 16 stitches). The area is irrigated with normal saline and other simple stitches added as required. The wound is dressed with Sofratulle, then with a regular dressing bandage and a strapping. The client is advised to rest for 30 minutes, and if stable, discharged home on mild analgesics. Upon completion of the procedure the surgeon completes a procedure form. The excised foreskin tissue is taken to the laboratory with no identifiers, discarded with other laboratory waste, and incinerated with other biological waste within three days. Participants will be given verbal and written instructions on postoperative wound care and counseled to refrain from sexual activity for at least six weeks after the procedure. They will also be encouraged to come to the clinic or contact a clinician at any time with medical problems. Day 7 Post Circumcision Visit: Circumcised men will be asked to return to the clinic 7 days after the procedure to check the wound, to see if it is healing properly, to check for complications, and to ask about their sexual activity, their level of pain, resumption of work or other activities, and their satisfaction with the procedure and care at the clinic. As with all visits, any adverse events will be recorded. Blood and urine will be collected for STD testing at this visit. Six month post operative visit: During this visit a brief exam to confirmed proper wound healing will be performed. A behavioral and satisfaction questionnaire will be administered. Unscheduled Follow-up Visits: Ad hoc clinic visits will be encouraged to check and treat for complications of the procedure. At such visits, medical examinations and laboratory testing will be conducted as indicated, and appropriate treatment provided free of charge. Medical referral will be made if required. d.2. Data analysis Each enrolled participant will be assigned a confidential code, which will be used in all study forms. Only the principal investigators and research assistants will have access to the ""locator information form"" containing personal information. This form, which links the subject's confidential code to his name, will be stored in separate locked filing cabinets at the local principal investigator's offices. The locator information forms, which contain the personal information on the subjects, will be kept for 1.5 years in case we need to contact one of the subjects for an unexpected occurrence or with a question. After the end of that period, these locator forms will be destroyed at the research offices at the respective study sites using a micro cut shredder. Data will be coded and entered into computer datasets by trained personnel. Data extracted from questionnaires will be tabulated and analyzed using SAS statistical software version 9.1. and will be analyzed at the University of Illinois, College of Medicine, in Chicago by the principal investigator A questionnaire asking specific demographic information will be administered. The following variables will be recorded: age, religion, place of residence (urban/rural), education level, occupation and marital status. Simple descriptive statistics will be calculated and the effect of these variables on the willingness, uptake and rate of adverse events of VMMC will be estimated. In addition, we plan to estimate the effect of demographic characteristics on sexual behavior and disinhibition after the procedure. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Uncircumcised men; 2. Aged 18-40 years Exclusion Criteria: 1. Foreskin covering less than half of the glans; 2. Bleeding disorders; 3. Keloid formation; 4. Other conditions that might unduly increase the risks of elective surgery."

"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",OTHER,NCT03508479,Study of Airway Inflammatory Responses to Experimental Rhinovirus Infection,Study of Airway Inflammatory Responses to Experimental Rhinovirus Infection,"This study is designed to characterize in detail the clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory features of Human Rhinovirus (HRV) infection in healthy volunteers without underlying lung disease while also evaluating the safety of HRV administrations.","The majority of severe exacerbations of asthma and need for hospitalizations are triggered by infection with respiratory viruses. Of these, rhinovirus is the most commonly implicated virus. Furthermore, there is evidence that viral infections exert synergistic effects with other stimuli to provoke asthma symptoms such as exposure to allergens and air pollutants. Experimental HRV infection studies have yielded important insights into the underlying disease mechanisms of viral-induced asthma exacerbations, and have been integral to identifying candidates for the development of new therapies. These studies have been safely conducted in both healthy and susceptible populations (those with underlying airway disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), for more than 60 years.

Much of the understanding of the clinical course of HRV infection is derived from experimental infections of healthy human volunteers. In these studies, subjects were inoculated intranasally with up to 10,000 \[tissue culture infectious dose (TCID)\] TCID50 of HRV, the most commonly used strains being HRV-16 and HRV-39. Experimental HRV infection produces the hallmark clinical features of the common cold including rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction. Respiratory symptoms typically develop 1-2 days after inoculation. Cold symptom scores generally peak 2-4 days post infection and return to baseline within 1 week in most infected subjects. HRV infection induces changes in inflammatory cell recruitment, nasal cytokine levels, and gene expression, which occur concurrently with clinical symptoms.

While the symptoms of HRV infection are typically limited to the upper respiratory tract in healthy subjects, those with underlying airway disease such asthma and COPD are more likely to exhibit an augmented and prolonged response to HRV infection with lower airway involvement. HRV is the leading viral cause of exacerbations of asthma and COPD; therefore, the response of these populations to HRV infection has been the focus of a number of studies. Although most studies in asthmatics have been performed in inhaled corticosteroid-naïve subjects, a recent study performed in subjects whose asthma was well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids demonstrates the safety of experimental HRV infection in this population. This model has also been employed in conjunction with other exposure models such as allergen challenge and pollutant exposure. There are several ongoing and recently completed clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize the HRV infection model. Of these, several employ the HRV-16 strain (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT01769573, NCT01466738, NCT01823640, NCT03073837, NCT03296917, NCT01704040, NCT02910401) being used in this study. Both healthy and asthmatic volunteers are represented in these clinical trials.

In summary, the experimental HRV infection model has proven to be a safe and valuable tool for examining various aspects of HRV biology. Due to the limitations associated with animal models of asthma and COPD, and the lack of animal species that are permissive for HRVs, experimental infection of humans with HRV has been integral for examining the pathophysiology of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD. Although experimental HRV-infection results in a reduction in lung function for some asthmatics and COPD patients, no serious adverse events have been reported using this model.

The goal of this study is to establish the experimental HRV-infection model in this research center using a viral inoculum referred to as RG-HRV-16. This strain was used in a recently-completed safety and dosing study (NCT01769573). Our study would provide the pilot data needed for the design of subsequent studies evaluating innate immune responses to HRV infection in asthmatics, modulation of HRV-induced responses by inhaled pollutants, and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents.","Inclusion Criteria:

Although Fluoroscopy guided technique is the most widely accepted method in lumbar selective nerve root injection, but recently ultrasound technique has gained acceptance among physicians due its reliability, efficacy, real-time guidance of injection and reduction of radiation exposure. Real-time guidance of injection provided by ultrasonography allows for good identification of the spinous process and adjacent structures such as lamina, zygapophyseal articulations and transverse process allowing for safer and potentially equally effective injection technique. The patients are randomly allocated into two groups; one group will receive injection under fluoroscopy guidance and the other group will receive injection under ultrasound guidance. The two groups are compared in terms of pain relief, accuracy and safety and radiation exposure. Inclusion Criteria: * adult patients aged 18-60 years . * Both sexes . * With unilateral chronic lumbar radicular pain for more than 3 months. * Cooperative and oriented patients. * All patients are diagnosed by a neurologist for radicular low back pain through clinical presentation, medical examinations, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Dr. Soetomo General Hospital,OTHER_GOV,NCT06139679,Improvement In Left Ventricular Diameter After Closure Of ASD With Fenestrated Patch: A Cross-sectional Study,Improvement In Left Ventricular Diameter After Closure Of Atrial Septal Defect With Fenestrated Patch: A Cross-sectional Study,"Introduction: The presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in atrial septal defect (ASD) poses a clinical challenge on whether or not to close the defect. Closing the defect increases the risk of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), while leaving the defect open may eventually lead to irreparable shunt reversal, hypoxemia, and death. The implementation of a fenestrated patch may halt LCOS while adding volume to the left heart.

Methods: this is an analytical observational study involving patients with ostium secundum defect with PH who were operated on in Dr. Soetomo Hospital between January 2017 and October 2021. The aim of this study is to evaluate the improvement in left ventricular size during both systole and diastole.","Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases. It is typically characterized by a left-to-right shunt which results in volume overload of the right ventricle and overcirculation of the pulmonary vascularization (le Gloan et al., 2018). This may further result in arrhythmia, right ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pulmonary hypertension is caused by endothelial dysfunction, remodelling of the pulmonary vascularization, which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventually causes shunt reversal into right-to-left (Eisenmenger's syndrome). At this point, closure of the defect is contraindicated.

Small LV, although less extensively studied than dilated LV, also implies impaired LV function. Small LV means less tolerance to volume overload, which in turn impairs cardiac output and presents higher risk of heart failure and mortality (Saito et al., 2021).

ASD closure in cases with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) presents a clinical challenge. Complete closure may cause pulmonary hypertensive crisis and low cardiac output syndrome; however, if left untreated, the disease progresses, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases, which may also lead to Eisenmenger's syndrome and shunt reversal. Today, this condition is treated with fenestrated closure, either with patch or fenestrated septal occluder. The fenestration is hypothesized to provide protective effect against pulmonary hypertensive crisis because it allows blood to flow from right to left heart. The added volume into the left heart is then, hypothesized, to provide volume training for the left heart, mainly in the case of small LV. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of fenestrated closure compared to non- fenestrated closure to the left ventricular size at systole and diastole.","Inclusion Criteria:

US Department of Veterans Affairs,FED,NCT00333879,Virtual Reality Mobility Training System for Veterans With Vision Loss,Virtual Reality Mobility Training System for Veterans With Vision Loss,"This is a two-year proof-of-concept study to evaluate a new Virtual Reality (VR) ""holographic"" sound system for use as an audiological Orientation and Mobility (O\&M) training tool","This is a two-year proof-of-concept study to evaluate a new Virtual Reality (VR) ""holographic"" sound system for use as an audiological Orientation and Mobility (O\&M) training tool. This new system avoids the limitations of other technologies (i.e., binaural recordings and existing VR sound systems) that have been employed with limited success for audiological training. Four advancements in the state-of-the-art represented by this new holographic system provide new promise for audiological O\&M training. First, unlike binaural systems, the new system allows the person to move their head in a natural fashion to localize sounds. Second, a spherical microphone array is used to record sound environments so as to retain the direction from which each ambient sound originated. When these recorded sound environments are later presented through head-tracking headphones in a VR environment, real-time software maintains the directionality of the sound so that it remains true no matter how the person moves or turns their head. Third, this new system models the actual physical acoustic structure of each person's head and ears to present sounds as they would be heard by that particular person in the recorded setting. Fourth, this system uses software algorithms to isolate specific sounds (i.e., of a moving vehicle) so that during virtual playback, these sounds can be inserted into the virtual sound field at will and in a customizable fashion to create truly unique and flexible virtual sound presentations.

There are two study hypotheses. First, when using sounds to negotiate traffic intersections, skills employed by experienced travelers in real environments will readily transfer to the proposed VR environment to the extent that audiological tasks performed in real environments are just as easily performed in the VR environment. Second, when the VR environment is enhanced to emphasize critical sound cues and eliminate distracting or confusing noises and sounds, performance by skilled travelers in the VR environment will be significantly better than in the actual environment.

The objectives are to: (1) adapt the existing spherical microphone array and digital recording software algorithms to best suit the capture of critical intersection sounds used for intersection negotiations; (2) develop software algorithms to deconstruct intersection sounds, isolating each sound for the VR construction of specific environments of varying complexity; (3) determine the level of sound detail necessary for negotiating intersections successfully; (4) expand the existing system to obtain the desired level of detail; (5) develop software to provide the ability to control the relative emphasis of a variety of sound elements being presented so as to simplify the auditory task; and (6) employ study participants to compare performance in the VR environment with outdoor performance.

Once validated, this system should be able to: (1) leverage instructor time by providing students with an effective means of practicing audiological skills on their own, (2) provide instructors with a means of introducing concepts in a graduated learning sequence that is not dependent on the happenstance availability of specific sounds and conditions found in real environments, and (3) provide audiological training for environments not located in the vicinity of the training site, but which do represent the veteran's home community.

Research will be conducted in collaboration with investigators in the Perceptual Interfaces and Reality Laboratory (PIRL) at the University of Maryland who initially conceived and developed this holographic VR sound system.

Polaris Health Directions,INDUSTRY,NCT02622984,Remote Brief Intervention and Referrals to Treatment Service for Alcohol,Remote Brief Intervention and Referrals to Treatment Service for Alcohol,"The traditional paradigm that relies upon training physicians and nurses or uses on-site interventionists to perform screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol has proven unsustainable in most clinical settings. The Remote Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (R-BIRT) for alcohol is an innovative telehealth service model with potential to improve public health through evidence based counseling for patients who exceed the NIAAA low risk drinking limits or have evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder with professional and self-help treatment. For those that are appropriate, the R-BIRT service will provide facilitated referrals to specialized alcohol abuse treatment. The service model is being studied in the emergency department (ED) setting to demonstrate its utility in a medical setting with a very high prevalence of risky alcohol use and Alcohol Use Disorders; however, the model is relevant and will be accessible to a broad array of healthcare settings, including primary care practices. Our new model, the R-BIRT, challenges the prevailing paradigm and offers the promise of not only clinical efficacy but increased cost effectiveness as well.","Significance: The USPHSTF, SAMHSA, CDC, and NIAAA have affirmed the importance of screening in medical settings for alcohol consumption that exceeds the NIAAA low risk limits, brief educational and motivational counseling for those who screen positive or have other evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder, and, when appropriate, referral to treatment (SBIRT). However, translation to clinical practice continues to be elusive. Polaris Health Directions (Small Business) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Research Institute) have partnered to solve this problem by creating the Remote Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment service for alcohol (R-BIRT), a telehealth service for delivering evidence based alcohol brief interventions and referral to treatment during a medical encounter in a cost-effective, sustainable way.

Investigators: The investigators have extensive expertise in SBIRT for alcohol (Boudreaux, Bernstein); telehealth (Boudreaux); development, testing, and marketing of behavioral intervention technologies (Boudreaux, Harralson); comparative effectiveness trial design and analysis (Barton); and health economics (Sachs). Combined, the team has over 100 publications related to SBIRT and constituent technology domains.

Innovation: This Phase 2 STTR will pioneer telehealth delivery of SBIRT for alcohol. It will be flexible enough for a variety of medical settings, and will develop and expand software capable of facilitating both telehealth and in-person SBIRT delivery models. It will further innovate SBIRT research and clinical practice by exploring mechanisms of action, an objective rarely incorporated into SBIRT studies.

Approach: The design is a two arm, single blind (outcomes assessor), randomized, non-inferiority trial. Emergency department (ED) patients (n=356) who drink above the NIAAA low risk limits or have evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder will be randomized to the telehealth model (R-BIRT) or a gold-standard in-person intervention (SBIRT) and followed for 6 months post-visit using a multi-method outcomes attainment plan. The study will establish the non-inferiority of the telehealth model compared to the in-person model in reducing alcohol use and alcohol related consequences, while showing that the telehealth model is the more cost effective of the two. Mechanisms of action, including patient knowledge of low risk drinking limits, motivation, self-efficacy, substance abuse treatment initiation, and self-help program engagement, will be examined.

Environment: With the success of the R-BIRT Phase 1 and other relevant projects, including previous large scale Phase 2 STTR clinical trials, Polaris and UMass have clearly established their capability of successfully carrying out this study, disseminating its results, and marketing the final product.

Impact: Because alcohol misuse, abuse, and dependence carries an enormous burden in both human suffering and healthcare costs, a strategy that provides high quality, evidence based care in a manner that is more cost effective and easier than existing models has potential to exert a substantial impact on public health.","Inclusion Criteria:

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,OTHER,NCT01852279,BCI and FES for Hand Therapy in Spinal Cord Injury,Brain Computer Interface Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation for a Hand Therapy in Tetraplegic Patients,This study will assess whether functional recovery of the hand muscles in patients with spinal cord injury is enhanced when electrical stimulation of the muscles is delivered actively by means of using the electroencephalography wave patterns arising from the patient imagining moving their hand to operate the stimulator. A control group will obtain the electrical stimulation treatment passively by a therapist operating the machine.,"Injuries of the higher levels of the spinal cord, called tetraplegia, result in a complete or partial paralysis of both legs and arms, making the person dependent on their caregivers for elementary activities of daily living (ADL) such as drinking and feeding. About 60% of tetraplegics have an incomplete injury and can partially recover their movement and sensation. The success of a recovery greatly depends on the therapy within the first year after the injury. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a relatively novel therapy of the hand. In FES therapy electrodes are attached on the surface the patients's forearms and electrical current is delivered through them. A disadvantage of the current FES therapy is that a therapist has to switch the stimulator on and off because patients cannot use either of their hands. In our previous pilot study performed on two acute tetraplegic patients we tested feasibility of using brain-computer interface (BCI) to control FES on patient's will. BCI is based on recording the patient's brain activity. BCI can detect the patient's intention to move the hand even if they are not able to physically move it. Using BCI, patients control the FES by thinking to move their hand.

A BCI-FES therapy will provide a simultaneous training of neural pathways from the brain to the hand muscle (motor imagination/attempt) and from the muscle to the brain (electrical stimulation of muscles). This form of therapy could promote faster and more complete recovery

In this controlled study we aim to provide a BCI-FES therapy to both chronic and subacute tetraplegic patients over a period of 20 sessions and to access the functional and neurological outcome of the therapy. Five chronic patients (more than a year after the injury) will participate in a cross-over study as we do not expect that they will recover spontaneously without BCI-FES. Subacute patients will be receiving both a conventional therapy and BCI-FES so recovery can be caused by either of these two therapies. Therefore it is necessary to have a treatment and a control group. Each group will have 10 patients, age and injury matched. Both groups will receive the same amount of electrical stimulation but only the treatment group will voluntarily control the electrical stimulator using BCI. A control group will receive passive electrical stimulation of the same hand muscles but without using BCI.","Inclusion Criteria:

Moritz Oberndorfer,OTHER,NCT04125784,Lipid Profile and Diabetes Mellitus in People With HIV,Lipid Profile and Diabetes Risk of HIV Patients Treated by Austrian HIV -Physicians: a 7 Year Follow up Study,"Traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases have been shown to have an even higher impact in the HIV infected population. The original study from 2014 was a cross sectional study into the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (namely, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus) in people living with HIV (PLWHIV) in Austria. The aim of this follow up study is to see the progression of our study sample and to see what prevalence levels may be found after 7 years. This epidemiological evaluation is conceptualized to document real life major cardiovascular risk factors of HIV-infected patients, focusing on lipid profiles and diabetes mellitus risk and to compare with the baseline values from the original study.","Background: In developed countries, an increase in cardiovascular events and related mortality has been seen; even more prominent in people living with HIV (PLWHIV) as compared to non-HIV control groups. Studies have shown dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus type 2 as important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in PLWHIV.

The original study by this group in 2014 was a cross sectional study into the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus) in PLWHIV in Austria and identified characteristics associated with these two risk factors. In that previous study dyslipidaemia was diagnosed in 46.3% of cases and half of all the study participants showed an increased insulin resistance. Eight persons (1.6%) fulfilled the criteria for diabetes mellitus type 2.

Purpose: The aim of this follow up study is to see the progression of our study sample and to see what prevalence levels may be found after 7 years. Additionally, a look into previously identified characteristics associated with dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus type may provide valuable insight into the temporal effects. Finally, examining resource use this population in terms of medications can provide insights into current practice and its associated costs in Austria, as well as an estimate of the added medication cost of dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus type 2 in this population.

It is our aim to close the existing knowledge gap on the role of dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus on cardiovascular risk among PLWHIV in Austria. Therefore, the investigation will be carried out by using routine data within minimum additional effort to the study team. The data obtained may serve as a base for future decisions on treatment of the Austrian HIV population.

Study details: Our epidemiologic evaluation documents real life major cardiovascular risk factors of HIV-infected patients, focusing on lipid profiles and diabetes mellitus risk. The gathered data from approximately 450 originally enrolled patients will be compared with the baseline values analysed in the original study in 2014.

Data collection: Dataset definitions and the minimum dataset will be determined by the study authors. Parameters used and documented must match those that were taken in the original study. These were specified in the case report form (CRF). The data collection and preparation will be done by a student of the Medical University of Vienna (Department of Social and Preventive Medicine) as a part of the graduate thesis.

Enrolment Strategy: Patients will be recruited through the original study sites (2 extramural HIV clinics in Vienna). Original patient lists will be screened through the official Mortality Register of the Statistics Austria, where patients who have died during the follow up period will be identified. Additionally, other patients who decline participation will be asked to give reasons of declining participation.

Data Validation and Data quality: Accurate data are crucial contributors to informative statistical analyses. Missing data will not be systematized.

Quality Control: Source documentation and data accuracy will be verified by site visit(s) in 1 randomly selected site after termination of the enrolment period. 10% of case report forms of the reviewed site will be randomly selected for monitoring.","Inclusion Criteria:

This decrease of T3 levels was observed after congenital heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Previous largest study,Triiodothyronine for Infants and Children Undergoing Cardiopulmonary bypass (TRICC) study showed T3 supplementation decreased time to extubation for infants less than 5 months undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Intravenous regiment was known effective in maintaining T3 levels during pediatric cardiac surgery. This drug preparation however is not commonly used in many countries due to the relatively high costs and/or the simple lack of availability. The use of oral T3 to treat postoperative low T3 levels in pediatric patients has not been reported so far, although recent adult studies showed benefit in using oral T3 after cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine if oral T3 supplementation could prevent the decline of serum T3 in children less than 2 years of age undergoing congenital heart surgery using CPB.","The Research Ethics Board at the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita approved this study and written, informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians before randomization. Randomization by block permutation was performed to determine treatment group assignment. Randomization occured on the day before surgery by a nurse investigator. A pharmacist who was not involved in the study prepared the study medication. Investigators and participants were blinded to the assigned group until after the end of the study.

Thyroid hormonal levels were analyzed by standard 3rd generation thyrotropic-stimulating hormone (TSH), serum free T4 (FT4), free T3 (FT3), and total T3 (TT3) Micro particle Enzyme Immunoassays (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, USA). The serum total T4 (TT4) assay used a Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, USA). Hormone levels were measured on induction of anesthesia, before the study drug was given (T0) and at 1, 6, 18, 36 and 72 hours after removal of the aortic-cross-clamp.

Baseline clinical data collected included age, gender, birth weight, type of operation, and Aristotle score. Diagnosis and operative procedures were classified as high or low risk with an Aristotle score cut off of ≥ 9 as high risk. As modifying factors, we measured duration of surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, cross-clamp time, ultrafiltration during CPB and degree of hypothermia during CPB, and the use of amiodarone. Non-pulsatile perfusion technique was used during CPB. Steroid (methyl prednisolone 35-50 mg/kg) was given before CPB. We used povidone-iodine for skin disinfection in all subjects. Although this study was not powered to detect clinical differences between the treatment groups, clinical outcome parameters were measured as a potential guide to subsequent adequately powered larger treatment studies. Serum lactate was measured at 1 hour, 4 hours and day 1 post surgery. Hemodynamic monitoring included heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure which were recorded hourly for the first 6 hours then every 6 hours until 72 hours after surgery. Overt symptoms of hyperthyroidism were grounds for immediate removal of the subjects from the study. Time to extubation and length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital were recorded.

Statistical analysis and sample size: The primary efficacy analysis assessed the difference between the treatment (high-dose, low-dose) and control groups with regard to the effect of T3 supplementation on the measured TT3 and FT3 serum levels. We anticipated a difference of 2.0 pg/ml in FT3 with a standard deviation of 0.8 pg/ml between groups. For a statistical power of 80% to identify a treatment effect and at a level of significance of 0.05 ( 2-sided), the target total sample size was 45 subjects, with 15 in each treatment group. Demographic data, safety and clinical outcomes were compared using the X2 test. Continuous variables for characteristics and outcomes were analyzed using one way ANOVA for data with normal distribution or the Kruskal Wallis test for not normally distributed data. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze all thyroid hormone levels and clinical outcomes for those variables that were measured repeatedly over time. Paired Student's t-test for parametric or Wilcoxon signed rank test for non-parametric tests were used to evaluate the mean difference of hormone levels and clinical outcomes over time in each treatment group.

Comparisons to results from a similar project in methadone-exposed pregnancies will be made. This proposal seeks to advance the way the investigators inform the treatment of the opioid dependent woman during pregnancy and her infant after birth.","There is an increase in the prevalence of illicit opiate use among women of childbearing age in many countries today. Methadone is the treatment of choice for opioid dependency during pregnancy in the US because it markedly diminishes withdrawal symptoms and craving and blocks opioid effects, however, in utero exposure results in significant depression of fetal neurobehaviors such as fetal heart rate and heart rate variability and fetal motor activity, and significant neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the majority of exposed infants. Since its approval in 2002, the prescription of buprenorphine for opioid dependence has increased dramatically but, as with methadone, this mediation is not approved for use during pregnancy. Currently, women treated with buprenorphine prior to pregnancy are transitioned to methadone treatment due to a lack of information regarding the effects of buprenorphine on the developing fetus and infant. Pilot work by this research team suggests that buprenorphine- as compared to methadone-exposed fetuses display more optimal neurobehavioral functioning in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Although these results are encouraging, there is a critical need to explore fully the effects of this medication on the fetus and infant to adequately advise care providers and patients regarding its use. This is particularly true given the imminent publication of a pivotal study comparing buprenorphine to methadone treatment during pregnancy which has suggested the optimality of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence during pregnancy, and is likely to result in increasing numbers of women being treated with off-label buprenorphine during pregnancy. This proposal seeks to explore the effect of buprenorphine on maternal physiology and fetal neurobehavioral functioning longitudinally as a measure of the development of the fetal nervous system. Additionally, the neurobehavioral profile and NAS of the buprenorphine-exposed infant up to one month will be delineated in an effort to provide information necessary to provide optimal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment of NAS. Furthermore, this group has previously explored similar parameters in methadone-exposed fetuses and infants, and results of this study can be compared to those historical data.

"National University Health System, Singapore",OTHER,NCT01974479,Pilot Study of Redirected Haploidentical Natural Killer Cell Infusions for B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,Pilot Study of Redirected Haploidentical Natural Killer Cell Infusions for B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Modern therapy for patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is based on intensive administration of multiple drugs. In patients with relapsed disease, treatment response is generally poor; for most patients, particularly those who relapse while still receiving frontline therapy, the only therapeutic option is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). There is no proven curative therapy for patients who relapse after transplant.

Natural killer (NK) cells have powerful anti-leukemia activity. In patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, several studies have demonstrated NK-mediated anti-leukemic activity. NK cell infusions in patients with leukemia have been shown to be well tolerated and void of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) effects.

NK cell cytotoxicity is most powerful against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, whereas their capacity to lyse ALL cells is generally low. We have developed a novel method to expand and redirect NK cells towards CD19, a molecule highly expressed on the surface of B-lineage ALL cells but not expressed on normal cells other than B-lymphocytes. In this method, donor NK cells are first expanded by co-culture with the cell line K562-mb15-41BBL and interleukin (IL)-2. Then, the expanded NK cells are transduced with a signaling receptor that binds to CD19 (anti-CD19-BB-zeta). NK cells expressing these receptors showed powerful anti-leukemic activity against CD19+ ALL cells in vitro and in an animal model of leukemia.

This study will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of infusing expanded, activated redirected NK cells into research participants with B-lineage ALL who have persistent disease after intensive chemotherapy . In this same cohort, we will study the in vivo lifespan and phenotype of these redirected NK cells.","1.0. Rationale

In contrast to the well-established cytotoxicity of NK cells against AML cells, their capacity to lyse ALL cells is generally low and difficult to predict. We sought to overcome this intrinsic resistance by transducing CD56+ CD3- NK cells with chimeric receptors directed against CD19, a molecule widely expressed by malignant B cells. Expression of anti-CD19 receptors linked to CD3zeta overcame NK resistance and markedly enhanced NK cell-mediated killing of leukemic cells. This result was significantly improved by adding the 4-1BB costimulatory molecule to the chimeric anti-CD19-CD3zeta receptor: the cytotoxicity produced by NK cells expressing this construct uniformly exceeded that of NK cells whose signaling receptors lacked 4-1BB, even when natural cytotoxicity was apparent (Imai et al., Blood 2005). NK cells expressing anti-CD19 receptors also exerted vigorous anti-ALL activity in a murine model of leukemia (Shimasaki et al., Cytotherapy 2012). Our findings indicate that enforced expression of signaling receptors by NK cells might circumvent inhibitory signals, providing a novel means to enhance the effectiveness of anti-ALL NK cell therapy.

The great anti-leukemic efficacy of genetically modified NK cells shown in our preclinical studies, together with the demonstrated feasibility of infusing durable haploidentical NK cells in a non-HSCT setting and the established expertise by the NUH team in cell therapy (the only center in Asia accredited by Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy, FACT), form a compelling rationale for the clinical testing of these NK cells.

The preparation of the key reagent (anti-CD19-BB-zeta mRNA) is finalized in the Tissue Engineering \& Cell Therapy (TECT) Laboratory at NUH, where the GMP-compliant MaxCyte electroporator is located. The feasibility of large-scale expansion of NK cells has been demonstrated (Shimasaki et al. Cytotherapy 2012), and the feasibility of large-scale electroporation validated in the TECT laboratory.

We will use flow cytometric and MRD technologies, to determine the presence of persistent disease , and will include in this study only patients with a limited amount of residual disease (\<1% leukemic lymphoblasts among normal bone marrow cells). We will use the same MRD methods to monitor the effects of treatment infusions. We do not expect that the conditioning regimen will have much effect by itself on leukemic cell counts, as the patients eligible for the study will have disease that is resistant to many anti-leukemic drugs. Nevertheless, because the conditioning regimen itself may have some salutary effects, it will be important to screen the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow for the presence of leukemic blast cells through all stages of the procedure, i.e., before, during, and after conditioning and after the NK cell infusion. The presence of leukemic cells in will be closely monitored by flow cytometry or PCR amplification of antigen-receptor genes (sensitivity for either method: 1 leukemic cell in 10,000) to shed some light on the relative effect of each intervention.

2.0. Hypothesis and Objectives

The main hypothesis to be tested in this study is that infusion of NK cells expressing anti-CD19-BB-zeta receptors by electroporation can produce measurable clinical responses in patients with resistant B-lineage ALL.

3.0. Primary Objectives

* To determine the feasibility and safety of redirecting NK cells with an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor by mRNA electroporation in a clinical setting.
* To determine the efficacy of anti-CD19 redirected NK cells in research participants with B-lineage ALL who have persistent disease as determined by MRD methods after intensive chemotherapy.

4.0. Secondary Objectives

* To study the persistence and phenotype of redirected NK cells in research participants with B-lineage ALL who have residual disease after intensive chemotherapy.

5.0. Endpoints

In this study, treatment response will be measured by comparing MRD levels before and at several intervals after NK cell infusion.Achievement of MRD negativity in bone marrow, i.e., \< 0.01% blasts by flow cytometry or PCR, will be regarded as a complete response. Partial response will be defined as ≥ 1 log decrease in MRD levels, while \< 1 log decrease in MRD levels will be regarded as a no response.

Based on previous studies, donor NK cells will be eliminated in most cases by the resurgent cellular immunity of the haploidentical recipient after the effects of the transient immunosuppression caused by the conditioning regimen have ceased (typically within 1 month of infusion). Conceivably, however, NK cell engraftment may persist for a longer period with the possible risk of prolonged pancytopenia owing to NK cell killing on normal hematopoietic cells. Because of this possibility, we will plan for HSCT rescue in patients receiving redirected NK cell infusions. Indeed, for most of the patients eligible for this study, HSCT would be the treatment intervention regardless of whether they receive NK cell infusions or not. Because of these considerations, the potential benefits of NK cell therapy should outweigh its risks for those patients eligible for this study, i.e., patients with persistent leukemia for whom no other proven effective treatment is available.

Because CD19 is universally expressed on B cells including early B cell precursors, normal recipient B cell will also be a target for the donor NK cells transduced with the anti-CD19 chimeric receptors. Therefore, transient B-cell lymphopenia and hypogammaglobinemia are expected. We will monitor the CD19+ blood cell count and measure the Ig levels once a month and will give the participants intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) if their IgG level is lower than age-specific ranges.

6.0. Summary of Study Design

Peripheral blood cell will be collected by apheresis from donors. After ex vivo expansion for 10 days by coculture with irradiated K562-mb15-41BBL cells (Fujisaki et al, Cancer Res 2009; Lapteva et al. Cytotherapy 2012) and T-cell depletion, haploidentical NK cells will be electroporated with anti-CD19-BB-zeta mRNA. Before infusion, patients will receive immunosuppressive therapy to promote temporary engraftment of NK cells. After infusion, they will receive IL-2 to support NK cell viability and expansion in vivo. The effects of NK cell infusion will be determine by comparing MRD levels before and after treatment.

Receptor expression after electroporation is transient and typically declines after 48 hours becoming undetectable after 96 hours. Because the aim of NK cell therapy is not to induce durable immunity but to rapidly reduce tumor cell burden, and the infused NK cells are rejected by the host immune system after approximately 2 weeks of infusion, the transient nature of the expression should not significantly affect anti-tumor potential. Moreover, by using this strategy, safety concerns regarding insertional mutagenesis and long-term persistence of transduced residual T cells do not apply. In any case, we will minimize the number of residual T cells in the final product as much as possible by depleting the expanded product of T cells by using the CliniMACS device, and by limiting the number of T cells in the graft to \<0.05 x 10\^6/kg.","Inclusion Criteria:

Moreover, by using this strategy, safety concerns regarding insertional mutagenesis and long-term persistence of transduced residual T cells do not apply. In any case, we will minimize the number of residual T cells in the final product as much as possible by depleting the expanded product of T cells by using the CliniMACS device, and by limiting the number of T cells in the graft to \<0.05 x 10\^6/kg.

Children's Hospital Los Angeles,OTHER,NCT02512679,Related Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) for Genetic Diseases of Blood Cells,Protocol for Related Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) for Treatment of Symptomatic Genetic Lymphohematological Diseases,"Many genetic diseases of lymphohematopoietic cells (such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Combined Immune Deficiency (CID), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, and metabolic diseases affecting hematopoiesis) are sublethal diseases caused by mutations that adversely affect the development or function of different types of blood cells. Although pathophysiologically diverse, these genetic diseases share a similar clinical course of significant progressive morbidity, overall poor quality of life, and ultimate death from complications of the disease or its palliative treatment. Supportive care for these diseases includes chronic transfusion, iron chelation, and surgery (splenectomy or cholecystectomy) for the hemoglobinopathies; prophylactic antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, and immunomodulator therapies for the immune deficiencies; and enzyme replacement injections and dietary restriction for some of the metabolic diseases. The suboptimal results of such supportive care measures have led to efforts to implement more aggressive therapeutic interventions to cure these lymphohematopoietic diseases. The most logical strategies for cure of these diseases have been either replacement of the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with those derived from a normal donor allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), or to genetically modify the patient's own stem cells to replace the defective gene (gene therapy).","The present study is to evaluate de-escalation of the cyclophosphamide (CY) dose in an innovative conditioning regimen with fludarabine and alemtuzumab as additional agents to achieve immunoablation, in combination with Busulfan (BU) to achieve myeloablation. Replacement of at least part of the cyclophosphamide dose by fludarabine in the conditioning regimen would be expected to maintain immunosuppression (and, therefore, engraftment) while reducing transplant-related complications (mucositis, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hemorrhagic cystitis, mucositis, and possibly GVHD), thereby improving disease-free survival rates. Similarly, the potential benefits of alemtuzumab in the proposed conditioning regimen are increased rates of hematopoietic engraftment with less toxicity than that observed with cyclophosphamide, ultimately resulting in improved immune function and enhanced quality of life (12,13). A fludarabine/alemtuzumab-based, less intensive conditioning regimen with adequate immunosuppressive activity could conceivably allow more successful engraftment of stem cells from related donors in patients with genetic lymphohematological diseases, as well as lower rates of transplant-related mortality.

Regimen-related toxicity is also believed to be a major contributing factor to GVHD (14). Therefore, conditioning regimens that cause less tissue injury may also lead to reduced GVHD. In the present study, the use of alemtuzumab in the conditioning regimen may be an added benefit, as this antibody causes T-cell depletion, thus, the risk of GVHD may also be reduced (15). The overall goal of the study is to improve the therapeutic index of HSCT by decreasing and, if possible, eliminating cyclophosphamide as a component of the pre-transplant conditioning for patients with genetic diseases of lymphohematopoiesis. The investigation will explore the risks and benefits of the proposed novel-conditioning regimen using a decreased dose of cyclophosphamide and additional immunosuppression with fludarabine and alemtuzumab to prevent graft rejection and recurrence of disease. The investigators will evaluate this regimen's impact on conditioning-related morbidity and mortality, and measure the success of the transplant procedure by engraftment and disease-free survival. If this regimen is able to successfully permit engraftment and reduce regimen-related toxicity, the next phase of treatment will test a further dose de-escalation for cyclophosphamide. It is anticipated that there will be four dose levels of cyclophosphamide in the overall study: 1) 105 mg/kg; 2) 70 mg/kg; 3) 35 mg/kg; and then finally, 4) 0 mg/kg. This study design was chosen to minimize study risks possibly associated with substitution of fludarabine and alemtuzumab for CY as immunoablation. The present protocol represents Level 1 in the study design; an amended protocol will be prepared prior to further de-escalation of the cyclophosphamide dose.","Inclusion Criteria:

* All patients with lethal or sublethal genetic lymphohematological disease (such as Hemaphagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) / Familial Erythrophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (FEL), Hurler's Syndrome, Hunter's Syndrome, Kostmann's Syndrome, Blackfan-Diamond Anemia, Chronic granulomatous Disease (CGD), Red Cell Aplasia, CID, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia, Adreno-leukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, X-Linked Lymphoproliferative Disease (XLD), Metabolic diseases affecting hematopoiesis, but not limited to), who are candidates for allogeneic transplantation for their disease and have a histocompatible sibling or related donor, ages 0 to 21 years, will be candidates for this study protocol. The suitable related donor is a 10/10 or 9/10 allele Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) match with the patient. All patients who have previously had serious life- threatening events due to disease process may be included in the study. Patients must have adequate physical function and vital organ function to tolerate transplant procedure, as measured by:

* Evaluation of iron status in patients who have received more than 12 red cell transfusions. Measurements of serum ferritin levels and MRI of the liver and heart tissue will evaluate the iron stores. If high iron load is identified in these organs further evaluation will be done to determine the suitability as transplant recipient. Should these studies indicate that chelation is necessary the following should apply: That the treating hematologist will provide the specific chelation type and timing. Evaluation of organ iron load will be part of the HSCT work-up and if high iron load is identified then the BMT team will work with the hematologist attending in developing a plan for the patient.

Columbia University,OTHER,NCT01938079,Pharmacokinetic Alterations During ECMO,Pharmacokinetic Alterations During ECMO (Ketamine and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation),"In a healthy patient, the lungs provide oxygen to the blood and remove carbon dioxide. However, in patients with severe lung failure, blood may not adequately be delivered to the lungs, or the lungs may not adequately supply blood with oxygen. In this case, patients may require assistance from a machine to help provide this oxygen. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a device that acts as an artificial lung, allowing the patient to recover from their illness. Patients receiving support from ECMO are often put in a medically induced coma while their lungs heal. Certain drugs may stick to the internal surfaces of the machine; therefore leading to decreased concentrations. Patients receiving ECMO often require high doses of both pain medications and sedatives in order to provide comfort. Low doses of a drug, ketamine, may help to provide additive effects to pain relief and allow lower doses of other pain medications. The hypothesis is that patients treated with continuous intravenous ketamine, will have lower requirements of other pain medications while receiving ECMO for acute respiratory failure while achieving the desired level of sedation.","The administration of analgesia and sedation is common practice for patients receiving mechanical ventilation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Maintaining patient comfort and safety, while not oversedating and thereby risking prolonged mechanical ventilation and delirium, is an ongoing balancing act which presents a daily challenge for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) clinicians. Medication selection should be based on the patient's needs with titration to a predetermined goal in accordance with published guidelines.

However, there are major pharmacokinetic changes that occur with the use of ECMO, including sequestration of medications within the circuit, increased volume of distribution, and in some cases decreased clearance. As a result patient's receiving ECMO often require very high doses of both analgesics and sedatives in order to provide comfort and ventilator synchrony. In patients not receiving ECMO, excess sedative exposure, especially with benzodiazepines, leads to increased mechanical ventilation time, prolonged ICU stay, short and long term neurocognitive impairments, and increased mortality. No studies address these outcomes in patients receiving ECMO.

Ketamine, a non-barbiturate phencyclidine derivative, provides analgesia with relative hemodynamic stability and maintained airway reflexes. However, its popularity waned because of an undesirable side effect profile: Hallucinations, delirium, lacrimation, tachycardia, and potential for an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and coronary ischemia. Recent research, however, suggests that low doses of ketamine infusions in combination with opiates may not be associated with adverse sequelae and may improve outcomes in the critically ill population. To date, there are no studies that have compared clinical outcomes in ICU patients sedated with ketamine as compared with other sedative agents.

Supplemental sedation with intravenous ketamine infusion may decrease opioid and sedative requirements for patients receiving mechanical ventilation and ECMO. The benefits of decreased opioid and sedative requirements may translate to fewer gastrointestinal side effects, decreased withdrawal syndromes, and a reduced rate of delirium.

Deep levels of sedation are often required at the commencement of ECMO for acute respiratory failure, which correlates to a Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) of -5. Supplemental low doses of ketamine infusions may help the prescriber achieve this goal without having to use very high doses of fentanyl or hydromorphone and midazolam.","Inclusion Criteria:

However, there are major pharmacokinetic changes that occur with the use of ECMO, including sequestration of medications within the circuit, increased volume of distribution, and in some cases decreased clearance. As a result patient's receiving ECMO often require very high doses of both analgesics and sedatives in order to provide comfort and ventilator synchrony. In patients not receiving ECMO, excess sedative exposure, especially with benzodiazepines, leads to increased mechanical ventilation time, prolonged ICU stay, short and long term neurocognitive impairments, and increased mortality. No studies address these outcomes in patients receiving ECMO. Ketamine, a non-barbiturate phencyclidine derivative, provides analgesia with relative hemodynamic stability and maintained airway reflexes. However, its popularity waned because of an undesirable side effect profile: Hallucinations, delirium, lacrimation, tachycardia, and potential for an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and coronary ischemia. Recent research, however, suggests that low doses of ketamine infusions in combination with opiates may not be associated with adverse sequelae and may improve outcomes in the critically ill population. To date, there are no studies that have compared clinical outcomes in ICU patients sedated with ketamine as compared with other sedative agents. Supplemental sedation with intravenous ketamine infusion may decrease opioid and sedative requirements for patients receiving mechanical ventilation and ECMO. The benefits of decreased opioid and sedative requirements may translate to fewer gastrointestinal side effects, decreased withdrawal syndromes, and a reduced rate of delirium. Deep levels of sedation are often required at the commencement of ECMO for acute respiratory failure, which correlates to a Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) of -5. Supplemental low doses of ketamine infusions may help the prescriber achieve this goal without having to use very high doses of fentanyl or hydromorphone and midazolam. Inclusion Criteria: * Receiving ECMO for acute respiratory failure * Requiring deep sedation (RASS -5) Exclusion Criteria: * Allergy to ketamine"

This study will explore the clinical impact of a customized cognitive stimulation program, using Musiquence.","Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive and irreversible deterioration of cognitive functioning that impairs behavioral and functional domains. Within non-pharmacological approaches, Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the most studied and well-established intervention for individuals with mild to moderate dementia. The underlying assumptions behind cognitive-based interventions of CST are:

1. IwD can benefit from cognitive stimulation if mobilized relatively preserved cognitive functions (e.g., crystallized abilities such as semantic memory and verbal skills), and;
2. Even in advanced age, exposure to enriched environments (i.e., socially and cognitively challenging) can enhance cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity.

Concerning the first assumption of cognitive-based interventions (a1), it is known that even in moderate to advanced stages of dementia, musical memory is one of the abilities that remain intact. It is hypothesized that music processing abilities precede the development of lexical language functions. This hypothesis is corroborated by findings that demonstrate that IwD are still responsive to music even when unable to communicate verbally or recognize words. Additionally, music is frequently associated with life experiences. Also, literature has reported that memories associated with specific music would be recollected longer than memories with no association to music; this suggests that using music as a reminiscence element on cognitive stimulation programs can have a promising effect on cognition. According to the second assumption of CST (a2), facilitating an enriching environment for IwD using, for , music and reminiscence elements could impact cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity.

In this context, Ferreira et al. developed a platform - Musiquence - that incorporates music and reminiscence in cognitive stimulation activities for IwD. Musiquence allows the gamification and personalization of 6 types of activities:

* Reality Orientation - a quiz-like activity that includes date and time information.
* Creative Drawings - a puzzle-like game in which the participant draws the missing pieces.
* Activities of Daily Living (ADL) - a puzzle-like game in which the participants have to perform a set of chores (i.e., brush the teeth), and the missing pieces are completed with real physical objects (i.e., toothpaste).
* Search Objects activity - exploration game in which the participants must find hidden images (e.g., cats) that are only visible through a virtual magnifying glass.
* Knowledge Quiz - participants must select the correct answer to a question among incorrect ones.
* Association activity - participants must categorize the items according to the instructions. For example, separate cars from motorcycles and locate them in the correct container.

"University Hospital, Montpellier",OTHER,NCT03098784,"Nanoparticles Emitted by Aircraft Engines, Impact on Respiratory Function","Nanoparticles Emitted by Aircraft Engines, Impact on Respiratory Function","The goal of this study is to assess the respiratory health of the Air France company's employees working in the Marseilles and Paris airports (flight line and administrative employees). This study was promoted by the Montpellier CHRU, Regional University Hospital Centre (ANSM identification number 2011-A00646-35). It allowes voluntary employees to be involved. They answer a lifestyle survey and perform a spirometry, an exhaled CO measurement and a sampling of exhaled air condensate (EAC). A metrological study of particles emitted by aircraft engines and found in the airport environment will be conducted and the elementary chemical composition analysis, as well a sieve analysis of particles present in the EAC will be conducted.","Air traffic is increasing, raising concern about local pollution and its adverse health effects on the people living in the vicinity of large airports. However, the highest risk is probably occupational exposure due to proximity. Jet exhaust is one of the main concerns at an airport and may have a health impact, particularly on the respiratory tract. Current studies are neither numerous enough nor strong enough to prove this kind of association. Yet, more and more people work in airports, and occupational exposure to jet exhaust is a fact. In 1999, the effect of occupational exposure to aircraft fuel and jet exhaust on pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms in Birmingham International Airport (Birmingham, UK) workers was reported. This work suggested that there was a link between high occupational exposure to aviation fuel or jet exhaust and excess respiratory tract symptoms, consistent with the presence of a respiratory irritant. It was a cross-sectional survey using a questionnaire filled out by the participants themselves. Respiratory and immunological function assessments and an exhaled carbon monoxide measurement were conducted with male full-time airport workers classified into three groups according to their exposure level.

The study will be presented to the volunteering subjects during an occupational medical appointment concerning their company. The information letter will be provided as well as the informed consent form to be filled for the study. Once the subjects have agreed to participate, self-surveys on their lifestyle habits will be filled and EACand urine samplings will be taken during one same consultation, in addition to exhaled CO and No measurements. This consultation will also include a spirometry test. The employees' workstation data will be collected. Therefore, the volunteers' participation is limited to one single visit including non-invasive examinations and self-surveys.

Method details:

* Survey: The survey breaks down into 2 parts, with a total of 94 items. The first part bears on the employees' respiratory health condition, essentially grounded on the validated EGEA survey. The rest focuses on employees' lifestyle habits, both professionally (outdoor and indoor working time, trade, type of exposure, etc.) and personally (geographical situation of the home, type of town or community, heating system, usual mode of cooking, etc.). The survey is anonymised and the answers are automatically read by datascan process.
* Spirometry: This method allows a non-invasive, simple and repeatable assessment of the respiratory function. It is indispensable to clearly explain the process to the patient. The patient sits with his or her back straight during the process. Once the subject and the device are ready, the subject deeply breathes in to fill the lungs then fully expires into the spirometer. Then the subject breathes in fully and forcedly in order to obtain the inspiratory curve. The spirometry results are compared with theoretical or predicted values determined based on patient's age, gender, size and ethnic group. Consequently, according to the subject's breathing speed and force intensity, measurements of vital capacity (VC) or forced vital capacity (FVC) are obtained. The curves will allow the other variables to be deduced, such as maximum expiratory volume per second (MEVS) or peak expiratory flow (PEF), or mean expiratory flows (MEF 25-75).
* Exhaled CO measurement (confounding factors of the respiratory function, in order to reflect the smoking status):the employee blows into the device's single-use cardboard mouthpiece after a deep inspiration followed by a fifteen-second apnea computed by the device. The measurement in part per million (ppm) is immediately displayed on the device to quantify the severity of CO intoxication. This measurement is simple and repeatable.
* Exhaled air condensate:for EAC acquisition. In fact, the RTube device is well adapted to non-invasion collection on the companies' sites. It will be used according to the recommendations from the American Thoracic Society and the EuropeanRespiratory Society. The R tube will be pre-treated as in the first study (intensive washing in order to abate background noise) and ""white"" R tubeswill be collected all through the study to check the method's detection limit. Briefly, the collection with nose blocked lasts for 15 minutes during which the subject breathes normally through the device. The mouth is rinsed with water before collection and the subject is asked to refrain from drinking or eating during the previous hour. This will allow ca. 1.4 ml to be collected (mean EACvolume collected during the first study over a 15-minute breathing time).
* Metrology:as this is a recent subject, there is no consensus so far on the most representative unit of measurement for employee exposure. Similarly, no current device allows all parameters to be obtained:quantitative data (particle content/cm3, sieve distribution, developed surface area of the alveolar fraction likely to be exposed in the breathing apparatus) and qualitative data (morphology, aggregation/agglomeration status, listof constitutive chemical elements). These experts' surveys require the implementation of different equipment. The method is based on personal metrology, use of portable and individual systems, as well as fixed installation metrology, organised into a single sampling by means of a cane to which the various measuring instruments are connected (Condensation ParticleCounter, ElectrostaticLow Pressure Impactor, Scanning MobilityParticleSizer, FastMobilityParticleSizer, Nanometer Surface Area Monitor, Alveolar Sensor, Alveolar Inhalable Thoracic sensor).An independent counter (Condensation ParticleCounter) allows background evolution to be monitored. Membrane sensors (such as the Giliansampling pump with membrane support) will also complement the process. They will be used as portable systems, on the employees involved in the study. Finally, the samples will be analysed by means of a SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope),model 5500 from Hitachi, associated with an energy-dispersive EDX system (X analysis system - Noranmodel from the Thermocompany).","Inclusion Criteria:

Bozok University,OTHER,NCT05368779,Online Psychosocial Intervention for Nursing Students Who Experienced Intimate Partner Abuse in Turkey,Online Psychosocial Intervention for Nursing Students Who Experienced Intimate Partner Abuse in Turkey: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Intimate partner abuse is very common among university students. Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse.The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse.,"Background: Intimate partner abuse is very common among university students. Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse. An intervention with evidence-based applications to post-traumatic stress caused by intimate partner abuse and posttraumatic growth, using web-based applications that young people are familiar with, is considered important in order to protect the physical-mental health of university students, to increase their academic success, and to ensure that they establish healthy intimate partner relationships in the future.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse.

Methods: The randomized controlled study that did not use blinding employed a 2x5 split-plot design. The universe of the study consisted of 371 student nurses. Students who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: experimental (n=17) and control (n=18). The internet-based psychosocial intervention, which was based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, was delivered individually and electronically to the students in the experimental group in eight sessions, each lasting up to 120 minutes, using videoconferencing. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PGTI) were used to measure the outcomes at the pre-test, post-test, 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up.

Discussion: The internet-based psychosocial intervention was found to be effective in reducing post-traumatic stress and experiencing post-traumatic growth in student nurses who had been exposed to partner violence with these positive effects lasting for six months. This study is one of the first web-based randomized controlled studies to address post-traumatic stress and growth together in university students who were exposed to intimate partner violence. It is hoped that the results of the study will guide the research to be carried out in this context by internet intervention in the future.

Leiden University Medical Center,OTHER,NCT01379079,Aspirin in Reduction of Tension II Study,Aspirin AM or PM in Reduction of Tension: a Randomized Cross-over Trial,"Aspirin is a cornerstone in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is usually taken on awakening, although evidence regarding optimal time of intake is lacking. Recent studies in healthy subjects with mild hypertension showed that aspirin at bedtime decreases blood pressure (-7/5mmHg), whereas intake of aspirin on awakening does not. Additionally, the investigators found that aspirin at bedtime decreases plasma renin activity, catecholamines and cortisol over 24hrs. Time-dependent effects of aspirin have never been studied in patients with CVD, who may use concomitant antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, platelet reactivity has a circadian rhythm, and intake of aspirin at bedtime may attenuate the morning peak in platelet reactivity. The investigators hypothesize that aspirin intake at bedtime compared with on awakening decreases both blood pressure and platelet reactivity over 24h.

A randomized open-label blinded endpoint crossover trial in which 250 patients, recruited from primary care, will be included who use aspirin for secondary prevention of CVD and have a stable blood pressure of 149/94mmHg or lower. Study subjects will randomly use both aspirin on awakening and at bedtime during two intervention periods of three months. Blood pressure will be recorded for 24hrs at the end of each treatment period in the patients' normal daily situation. To assess effects on platelet inhibition, thromboxane-B2 levels will be measured in a 24h urine sample at the end of both treatment periods. The investigators will asses differential effects according to time of intake on gastrointestinal complaints and potential minor bleeding events, as well as compliance.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of aspirin taken at bedtime compared with on awakening on blood pressure of subjects with stable CVD. In addition, it will generate insights into the effect of aspirin on platelet reactivity over 24hrs, potential side effects and compliance.","Aspirin is a cornerstone in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease because of its inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation. It reduces the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events with about a quarter. Although not supported by evidence, aspirin is usually taken at morning. There are several reasons why it may be more beneficial to take aspirin at bedtime instead of on awakening. First, one of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease is arterial hypertension. Aspirin is usually assumed to have no effects on blood pressure. However, in two randomized clinical trials of Hermida et al. among (otherwise healthy) grade I hypertensive subjects (140/90-159/99 mmHg), aspirin intake at bedtime decreased 24h blood pressure with 6.8/4.6 and 7.2/4.9 mmHg, whereas use of aspirin at morning slightly increased blood pressure (2.6/1.6 and 1.3/0.8 mmHg). The investigators have demonstrated that aspirin at bedtime decreases both plasma renin activity over 24h and excretion of catecholamines and cortisol in 24h urine compared to morning intake. Decreased activity of these pressor systems forms a biologically plausible explanation for the finding that aspirin at bedtime may reduce blood pressure whereas aspirin at morning does not. The effect of aspirin at bedtime versus on awakening on blood pressure has never been studied in a clinically relevant group of patients, i.e. patients already using aspirin for the secondary prevention of recurrent atherothrombotic events who mostly use also a wide variety of concomitant (antihypertensive) drugs. If time of intake has an effect, this could lead to a very simple improvement of therapy at no extra cost. Second, it has been convincingly shown that there is a morning peak in platelet reactivity, which might partly explain the increase in cardiovascular events in the early morning (highest incidence between 6 and 12 AM). Coming in an upright posture can lead to increased platelet activity and platelets can also be stimulated by the early morning increase of sympathetic activity (which starts few hours before awakening). Since platelet reactivity has a circadian rhythm, time of intake of aspirin may influence its inhibitory effect on platelets. It has been argued that intake of aspirin at bedtime could better prevent the early morning increase in platelet reactivity than intake at morning assuming that intake at morning would be too late.

The aim of our project is to study whether treatment with aspirin at bedtime compared with intake at morning has additional benefits in patients using aspirin to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events. Our primary objective is to study the effect of 100 mg aspirin intake at bedtime compared with 100 mg aspirin intake at morning on blood pressure (24h ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM)) in patients who use aspirin for secondary prevention of recurrent atherothrombotic events. As a secondary objective, the investigators will study the effect of aspirin intake at bedtime compared with at morning on platelet function. Furthermore, the investigators will address differential effects on potential side effects and compliance, as well as potential effect modification of the effect on blood pressure by genes involved in blood pressure regulation.","Inclusion Criteria:

Background:

* Parents and families of children with chronic illnesses have stressors, including financial stress, role strains, separations, and interruptions in daily routines and plans for the future. All of these experiences may lead directly and indirectly to parental stress.
* The number of families headed by single or lone parents is increasing. Little work has been done to better understand if the needs of parents who are providing care for a child on their own differ from parents who do not classify themselves as lone. Identifying parents who may need additional support within a pediatric oncology setting is very important so that appropriate support is provided.

Objectives:

- To better understand the social, emotional, and practical effects of lone parents on children with cancer.

Eligibility:

* All parents whose child has been diagnosed with cancer between 6 and 18 months before enrolling on the study.
* Participants must be able to speak and read English

Design:

* Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire during one of their child s clinic or hospital visits.
* The questionnaire will ask about the parenting experience since the child was diagnosed with cancer. It will ask about the support the parent has received from family and friends since the diagnosis.
* The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.","Background:

* Research examining the potential impact of childhood chronic illness on parents and families has delineated a myriad of stressors that parents may experience, including financial stress, role strains, separations, interruptions in daily routines and plans for the future, and general uncertainty regarding the child s prognosis.
* All of these possible experiences may lead directly and indirectly to anxiety, depression, posttraumatic-stress, hopelessness, and feelings of loss of control in parents and families.
* The number of families headed by single, or lone parents has increased significantly, with 3 in 10 children now living in single parent homes.
* It is not known whether distress is greater for parents who are lone parents.
* Lone-parent families earn on average only 55% of what married-parent families earn, and are four times more likely to live in poverty.
* It is unclear how lone parents trying to navigate the complex needs of maintaining a home, family, and a chronically ill child adapt to these challenges.
* It is also unclear how many parents who check single on a standardized forced choice questionnaire format consider themselves to be lone when it comes to the experience of caring for their child with cancer.

Objective:

\<TAB\>

* Aim 1: To define and characterize lone parents
* Aim 2: To describe perceptions of social support and how they relate to lone and non-lone parenting
* Aim 3: To identify distress outcomes in parents of children with cancer who identify themselves as being lone when it comes to the experience of caring for a child with cancer

Study Population:

English and Spanish speaking parents of a child (1through 17 years) with a malignancy, diagnosed 6-18 months before recruitment will be invited to participate in this study.

Design:

-This is a pilot, exploratory study designed to describe the perceptions of support and distress outcomes of single/lone parents of a child with cancer. Participants will be administered a Lone Parent Support Questionnaire designed for this study. The study will be completed in one visit (\<30mins).","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Little work has been done to better understand if the needs of parents who are providing care for a child on their own differ from parents who do not classify themselves as lone. Identifying parents who may need additional support within a pediatric oncology setting is very important so that appropriate support is provided. Objectives: - To better understand the social, emotional, and practical effects of lone parents on children with cancer. Eligibility: * All parents whose child has been diagnosed with cancer between 6 and 18 months before enrolling on the study. * Participants must be able to speak and read English Design: * Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire during one of their child s clinic or hospital visits. * The questionnaire will ask about the parenting experience since the child was diagnosed with cancer. It will ask about the support the parent has received from family and friends since the diagnosis. * The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. Background: * Research examining the potential impact of childhood chronic illness on parents and families has delineated a myriad of stressors that parents may experience, including financial stress, role strains, separations, interruptions in daily routines and plans for the future, and general uncertainty regarding the child s prognosis. * All of these possible experiences may lead directly and indirectly to anxiety, depression, posttraumatic-stress, hopelessness, and feelings of loss of control in parents and families. * The number of families headed by single, or lone parents has increased significantly, with 3 in 10 children now living in single parent homes. * It is not known whether distress is greater for parents who are lone parents. * Lone-parent families earn on average only 55% of what married-parent families earn, and are four times more likely to live in poverty. * It is unclear how lone parents trying to navigate the complex needs of maintaining a home, family, and a chronically ill child adapt to these challenges. * It is also unclear how many parents who check single on a standardized forced choice questionnaire format consider themselves to be lone when it comes to the experience of caring for their child with cancer. Objective: \<TAB\> * Aim 1: To define and characterize lone parents * Aim 2: To describe perceptions of social support and how they relate to lone and non-lone parenting * Aim 3: To identify distress outcomes in parents of children with cancer who identify themselves as being lone when it comes to the experience of caring for a child with cancer Study Population: English and Spanish speaking parents of a child (1through 17 years) with a malignancy, diagnosed 6-18 months before recruitment will be invited to participate in this study. Design: -This is a pilot, exploratory study designed to describe the perceptions of support and distress outcomes of single/lone parents of a child with cancer. Participants will be administered a Lone Parent Support Questionnaire designed for this study. The study will be completed in one visit (\<30mins). * INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Parents or primary guardians of children (ages 6 months through 17 years) with any malignancy whose child is 6-18 months post-diagnosis. 2. Ability to give informed consent. 3. English or Spanish speaking EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Severe psychological distress which - in the judgment of the Principal or Associate Investigators at each respective collection site- would compromise the participant s ability to understand the questionnaire or is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results. 2. Relapse of malignancy"
Stefano Colagrande,OTHER,NCT01411579,Use of DwI-MR to Predict Chemotherapy Response of Liver Metastases and Hepatocarcinoma,Assessment of Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging to Predict Chemotherapy Outcome in Liver Metastases and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC),"One of the most recent and interesting field of diagnostic imaging is diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DW-MRI). Various studies evaluated the application of DW-MRI to diffuse liver disease and focal liver lesions providing controversial results, probably due to the difficult reproducibility of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements. It is conceivable that a wide inter/intra-individual variability actually exists in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-values, and that each apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-value presents an higher reliability in measuring the temporal changes of water diffusion within the same individual (longitudinal-evaluation), than in characterizing tissues between different patients (transverse-evaluation). For these reasons, some previous studies assessed the application of DW-MRI in predicting the chemotherapy (CHT) outcome in liver metastases. The rationale of these studies was the overt biochemical changes shown by the neoplastic cells after CHT and the sensitivity of DW-MRI in the identification of such changes. The same authors noticed that the metastatic lesions with the lowest ADC-values present also the best outcome after CHT. Moreover, these studies suggest that it could be possible to assess if each single patient will respond (R) or not (NR) to the CHT through liver DW-MRI performed from 3 days to 3 weeks after the beginning of CHT.","In R patients an increase of the mean diameter of the neoplastic cells should be present from the first week of CHT with a consequent reduction of the ADC-value. Then, the ADC-value should increase after 2-3 weeks due to the reduction of the cellular volume and to the increase of the membrane permeability. In NR patients, these biochemical changes should not be present with a consequent constant ADC-value before/after CHT. Our multicentre study will allow the recruitment of a higher number of patients vs. previous studies. Moreover, presently the outcome of CHT in liver metastases is evaluated only after 2-3 cycles of CHT according to the RECIST (Response-Evaluation-Criteria-In-Solid-Tumors) and then merely on a dimensional basis. Anyway, frequently liver metastases in R patients, can not show any significant dimensional change, while they present several biochemical/metabolic changes, not included in the RECIST, but probably detectable by DW-MRI.

The principal objective of the study is the early assessment of CHT outcome in liver metastases and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with liver metastasis will be stratified as R and NR on the basis of the contrast-enhanced CT examination performed 20 days after the beginning of the second cycle of CHT; patients with HCC undergoing therapy with Sorafenib will be stratified as R and NR on the basis of the contrast-enhanced CT examination performed 90 days after the beginning of the therapy. The ADC-values obtained before and after the first CHT cycle will be compared between each patient category to assess the grade of agreement between the dimensional and functional parameters. Moreover, the investigators' aim is to assess whether those liver metastases or HCCs presenting a lower ADC-value before CHT are actually more responsive to CHT in comparison to liver metastases and HCCs presenting a higher ADC-value.

Secondary objectives: to propose some additional functional criteria to the RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST (for HCC) criteria based on water diffusion and biochemical changes of the neoplastic cells. As a further objective it is possible to hypothesize a different response to CHT of the different tumor histotypes detectable from the different ADC changes induced by CHT.

Patient population

Inclusion criteria:

* of age, compliant, patients enrolled for CHT, without major contraindications to the MR examination;
* non-confluent liver metastases, from every primary carcinoma histotype biopsy/surgical-proven, without intralesional necrosis/calcification involving \>30% of their volume;
* multiple confluent hepatocellular carcinomas, histotype biopsy/surgical-proven in prevision of treatment with Sorafenib;
* at least one marker lesion allowing reproducible ADC measurements, i.e. placed at the level of the lower right liver segments;
* detection/enrolment by contrast-enhanced CT before CHT that allow to define the lesion size or the gross parenchymal involvement (if HCC).

Each patient will sign an informed consent, after the procedure will be completely explained.

For the metastasis: three diameter of each marker lesion will be measured, and the mean/minimal/maximal ADC±standard deviation will be quantified by region-of-interests (ROIs) placed within the lesion avoiding lesion margins and the necrotic/intratumoral calcification areas. All measurements will be repeated for three times even at the level of the adjacent liver parenchyma (within 3 cm from the lesion margins, keeping a ROI diameter \>2 cm). Consequently, the absolute values (s/mm2) of ADC, and the ADC percentages vs. the adjacent liver parenchyma measured at the different times will be compared.

For HCC: three diameter of gross parenchymal involvement will be measured, and the mean/minimal/maximal ADC±standard deviation will be quantified by large region-of-interests (ROIs) placed within the liver lobe containing the involvement. All measurements will be repeated for three times even at the level of the adjacent normal liver parenchyma (within 3 cm from the lesion margins, keeping a ROI diameter \>2 cm). Consequently, the absolute values (s/mm2) of ADC, and the ADC percentages vs. the adjacent liver parenchyma measured at the different times will be compared.

Imaging

For metastasis: patients will be scanned by DW-MRI and contrast-enhanced CT before the beginning of CHT (Time 0). The time between the initial MRI and contrast-enhanced CT should not be superior to one week. MRI examination will be repeated within one week (Time 1) and 20 days from the beginning of the first cycle of CHT (Time 2), and 20 days from the beginning of the second cycle of CHT (Time 3).

For HCC: patients will be scanned by DW-MRI and contrast-enhanced CT before the beginning of CHT (Time 0). The time between the initial MRI and contrast-enhanced CT should not be superior to one week. MRI examination will be repeated after 30 days (Time 1), 60 days and 90 days (Time 3) from the beginning of the CHT.

Contrast-enhanced CT will be performed contemporarily or within one week after the last MRI examination.

Contrast-enhanced CT examination will be performed according to an established protocol by using a 16/64-row equipment according to the centre involved, contrast bolus-track technology, slice- thickness reconstruction of 3 mm, before/after ev. injection of iodinated contrast agent (3 mL/s), during arterial/portal phase.

All MR examinations will be carried out using the following 1.5-T units:

* Gyroscan ACS NT Intera Release 12 (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) (Trieste and Florence), gradient strength, 30 mT/m; slew rate, 120 T/m/s; six-channel phased array multicoil;
* Magnetom Avanto (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) (Treviso and Napoli), gradient strength, 45 mT/m; slew rate, 200 T/m/s; 2 phased-array coils with 18 elements. The different MR equipments employed by the different centers will be calibrated by a dedicated phantom.

The phased array multicoil will be adequately positioned to cover the upper abdomen of the subject lying in a supine position, the arms extended over the head to avoid artifacts. Patients, fasting from 4 hours, will be instructed to maintain a constant respiration depth, even with the possibility to use exogenous oxygen delivery to avoid deep respiration. All acquisitions will be obtained by single-shot sequence to obtain immediately/automatically the ADC-values.

The protocol included the following acquisitions:

1. T2-weighted half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) free-breath sequence; transverse/coronal plane; TR/TE, 810/80 ms; echo-train length, 69; slice number, 40; slice thickness, 5 mm; intersection gap, 10%; field of view, 300-420 mm; effective matrix size, 256 x 165; number signal averages (NSA), 1; total acquisition time, 2-3 min;
2. T1-weighted 2D gradient echo in/out phase breath-hold sequence; transverse plane; TR/TE, 231-121/ 14.6-2.3 ms; slice thickness, 5 mm; slice number, 24; intersection gap,10%; flip angle, 80°; sense factor, 1.5; field of view, 300-420 mm; effective matrix size, 256 x 165; NSA, 1; total acquisition time, 18 s;
3. D-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) single-shot free-breath sequences will be acquired on transverse plane with variable EPI factor and the following parameters. Fat suppression will be obtained by spectral pre-saturation inversion recovery. Isotropic motion probing gradients will be applied for each DwI acquisition and for each b-value will be obtained images and corresponding ADC map.

The investigators presently define as R those patients who show a reduction of the liver metastasis or HCC diameter ≥30% on contrast-enhanced CT at three weeks after the beginning of the second CHT cycle; if not, it was considered NR. Changes in tumor size after treatment were calculated by using the formula % Vend =(VB -Vend)/VBx100, where VB was lesion size before treatment (maximum transverse diameter) and Vend was lesion size 20 days after the second administration.

On the basis of the dimensional reduction of liver metastases and parenchymal involvement (for HCC) on contrast-enhanced CT on Time 3 vs. Time 0 scan, each patient will be classified as R or NR according to the RECIST and mRECIST criteria. Afterwards, on the basis of the ADC-values measured during the different MR examinations, the inter/intra-individual ADC-values will be compared to the results of contrast-enhanced CT to assess the relation between reduction of the liver metastasis diameter and:

* increase of the ADC-value on Time 3 (after the end of CHT);
* reduction of the ADC-value on Time 1 (very early assessment);
* increase of the ADC-value on Time 2 (early assessment); and to assess whether the lesions with the highest pre-treatment ADC-value present also the highest dimensional reduction and the highest ADC-value at the end of CHT; In each center each evaluation will be performed three times by two blinded observers (all trained how to place the ROI by an inter-centre conference) to assess the reproducibility of all measurements. The observers who will assess the MR images will be different from the observers assessing the CT images and will not be aware about the size changes after CHT. The investigators will perform data mathematical fitting on multi-b DW-MRI data sets to calculate the true diffusion and the perfusion fraction.

Statistical analysis will employ linear regression analysis to assess the association between the ADC-value changes and the CHT outcome.

The transferability of the results of the present study to the clinical practice will be possible after the achievement of the primary objective, corresponding to the possibility of stratifying patients as R and NR to CHT through DW-MRI just after one week of treatment and/or with the pre-treatment ADC assessment. Nowadays, it is necessary to wait 20-30 days after the end of the second or third CHT cycle to know the individual outcome of CHT. This determines 2-3 months of ineffective therapy with consequent avoidable pain for the patients related to drug administration, and unusable costs. The possibility to know the response of each patient to CHT well in advance will allow avoiding vain drug administration to patients who could attempt a different treatment or drug combinations reducing treatment costs.

The clinical transferability of the present study will be performed after the achievement of one or both the secondary objectives, corresponding to the identification of functional criteria based on water diffusion and biochemical features of the neoplastic cells which can be proposed as additional or alternative criteria to the RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, and to the identification of a different response to CHT of different tumor histotypes. If only one of these objectives will be reached this study will achieve an important result, allowing a more correct assessment of individual response to CHT.","Inclusion criteria:

Sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq was performed, followed by analysis of alpha and beta diversity.","The study was conducted over 10 months, from March to December 2019, with patients recruited from Al Bashir public hospital,A convenient sample of 54 participants were approached (27 asthmatic patients and 27 healthy subjects). All the asthmatic patients were recruited from an outpatient clinic at Al Bashir hospital. Study participants were informed about the nature of the study and were included only after obtaining their consent verbally and voluntary. Sociodemographic characteristics were collected from all study participants.

Specimens were collected according to the CDC guidelines for collecting respiratory diseases' samples. All participants were asked to expectorate a sputum sample in special sterile tubes indicated for sputum collection. Particular care was taken to avoid contamination of the sputum sample with the saliva and post-nasal drip by asking the participants to rinse their mouth with sterile water before inducing the sputum sample. Then the expectorated sputum specimen was immediately homogenized and stored in the deep freezer (-80°C) for DNA extraction for microbial gene sequencing and sequence analysis.

located in Amman, the capital city of Jordan. DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing DNA extraction using QIAamp® DNA mini kit (QIAGEN) was done under aseptic techniques in the sterile room for all samples according to the manufacturer instructions. The DNA extracts for the 54 samples collected (27 from asthmatic patients and 27 from healthy subjects) were stored at -80° C in a sterile Eppendorf tubes until they were sent to the Molecular Research (MR DNA) Lab (Molecular Research LP, Shallowater, TX, USA) for sequencing. Briefly, PCR amplification of the 16s rRNA gene and its subsequent sequencing was done using Illumina. The 16s rRNA gene V4 variable region PCR primers ill27Fmod (AGRGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) /ill519Rmod (GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG) with barcode on the forward primer were used in 30 cycles using the HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, USA). After amplification, PCR products were checked in 2% agarose gel to determine the success of amplification and the relative intensity of bands.

The pooled and purified PCR product was then used to prepare the Illumina DNA library. Sequencing was performed on a MiSeq following the manufacturer's guidelines. Sequence data were processed using the MR DNA analysis pipeline (MR DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA). In summary, the sequences were joined, depleted of barcodes then sequences \<150bp removed, sequences with ambiguous base calls were removed. Sequences were denoised, Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated and chimeras removed. The OTUs were defined by clustering at 3% divergence (97% similarity). Final OTUs were taxonomically classified using BLASTn against a curated database derived from RDPII and NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu). For alpha diversity index, namely, Shannon index H, it was carried out in ""Past Program"" for data analysis version 4.02, after filtering out the reading with relative abundance of \<1%.

The study was conducted over 10 months, from March to December 2019, with patients recruited from Al Bashir public hospital,A convenient sample of 54 participants were approached (27 asthmatic patients and 27 healthy subjects). All the asthmatic patients were recruited from an outpatient clinic at Al Bashir hospital. Study participants were informed about the nature of the study and were included only after obtaining their consent verbally and voluntary. Sociodemographic characteristics were collected from all study participants. Specimens were collected according to the CDC guidelines for collecting respiratory diseases' samples. All participants were asked to expectorate a sputum sample in special sterile tubes indicated for sputum collection. Particular care was taken to avoid contamination of the sputum sample with the saliva and post-nasal drip by asking the participants to rinse their mouth with sterile water before inducing the sputum sample. Then the expectorated sputum specimen was immediately homogenized and stored in the deep freezer (-80°C) for DNA extraction for microbial gene sequencing and sequence analysis. located in Amman, the capital city of Jordan.

In this context, the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group (GhPSJ) very early on wanted to implement an institutional approach aimed, on the one hand, at enabling each of its employees at its two sites (Hôpital Paris Saint-Joseph (HPSJ), Paris 14ème and Hôpital Marie Lannelongue (HML), Le Plessis Robinson, 92) to access their serological status with regard to SARS-CoV-2 and, on the other hand, to identify the risk factors for contracting COVID-19.

This collective approach consisted of an evaluation of its professional practices aimed at assessing the protective measures put in place to protect hospital personnel and identifying sources of potential improvement in the management of the infectious risk required to put in place in case of upcoming COVID-19 cases or any other epidemics in the future.","This institutional process had been validated by senior management and staff representative bodies. It was based on voluntary work, anonymity, the confidential aspect of the employees' analyses with the establishment of a follow-up and an individual counselling organized by the Occupational Health Service (SST) team and a team of COVID-19 Serology referents appointed to carry out and coordinate this process. Among the 3,600 GhPSJ employees, 3,062 (85%) samples were taken (and 404 employees from partner establishments in the hospital complex) for an initial serology test between April, 20th and May,15th and a second test one month later (M1) between May 18th and June 12th. The purpose of this second sampling was to get rid of the fear of another infection that might have occurred on the date of the first serology, and to observe the evolution between the two samples at the end of the epidemic phase.

The first results identified 310 people (231 from the HPSJ site and 56 from the HML site) (10.1%) with a positive serology for SARS CoV-2. However, it was observed that the people infected by the COVID-19, had highly variable IgG antibody titers and these titers changed unexpectedly. In fact, the majority of cases (89%) showed a drop in antibody titers as early as the first month and 20 of them (6.4%) even showed a negativation based on the index of quantitative ELISAs performed.

After only 5 months of hindsight in the face of this new pandemic, there are a few robust and specific data on the immune response following the COVID-19 and its involvement in the clinical impact on infected patients. In addition to the epidemiological interest and potential protection, the use of the immune response is an important therapeutic issue that is currently being evaluated, whether for passive immunization or primary prevention, with highly anticipated prospects for vaccination of populations.

It should be noted that the severely infected patients present characteristics unique to COVID-19 that are rarely seen in other respiratory viral infections, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, pneumonia and extensive lung damage, cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multisystem failure, and numerous atypical presentations (ENT, digestive, mucocutaneous, etc.). A high viral load at the time of first infection and/or repeated exposures to the virus, particularly for healthcare professionals, may be an important factor in the evolution of the disease (severe clinical forms, delayed clinical signs and particular serological kinetics).

A non-union is a lack of bone healing (bone growth where the break in the bone occurred) after 3 months after the operation. The diaphyseal is an area of a specific bone (usually near the middle) where the fracture occurred. The bones we are interested in are the clavicle (collar bone), tibia (lower leg), femur (upper leg), humerus (upper arm) and forearm (lower arm). Treatment goals for these types of fractures are to minimize later surgeries, to assist the healing process, and to decrease the time to healing. The ability of a patient with non-union (lack of bone healing after 3 months post operation) to return to the work force and to normal activities more quickly not only has a good financial impact on society (community), but also improves over-all physical and mental well-being of the patients.

""Infuse"" is a synthetic bone morphogenic protein which means it has the ability to help your bone to form and heal if inserted in the fracture site. ""Infuse"" may be the first commercially available product approved by Health Canada to accelerate the healing of long bone non-unions requiring surgical intervention.

Although the safety and efficacy of Infuse has been demonstrated through numerous pre-clinical studies, further human clinical trial is needed to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of this product particularly with respect to non unions of long bones. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of Infuse implanted during treatment of long bone non unions to reduce later surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.

Given this, the orthopaedic community has planned this study in order to scientifically establish the most effective treatment method to restore function after this type of injury.","We propose a multi-centre Canadian randomized Study wherein 80 patients are randomized (put in groups by no standard pattern ie. flipping a coin) to receive both autograft (sample of your own bone: iliac crest) and allograft (bone chips from bone bank) or ""infuse"" (synthetic bone morphogenic protein) and allograft using locked plates. Locked plates are surgical plates placed on the fracture in which the screws lock into the plate when they have been completely screwed into the bone through holes on the plate. Our objective is to assess the total cost of the patients treated in both study group and the benefits of the Infuse by comparing the new bone formation in the fracture site.

Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,OTHER,NCT00841984,In Vitro NMR Spectroscopy in Neurological Diseases,Evaluation of in Vitro NMR Spectroscopy to Identify Inborn Errors of Metabolism in Patients With Complex Neurological Diseases,"The search for metabolic abnormalities in patients with neurological disorders represents an important challenge 1) to identify new potentially treatable inherited metabolic diseases, and 2) to identify biomarkers or new treatments in more common neurodegenerative or neurogenetic disorders.

This approach is currently limited by the fact that techniques aiming at identifying abnormal metabolites in human fluids (metabolomics) only detect subsets of molecules and that no general assays is available to detect abnormalities in the metabolism of complex molecules that takes place within cell organelles. As a consequence, only limited parts of the metabolism can be studied simultaneously.

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether NRM spectroscopy of body fluids (urines, cerebrospinal fluid) could allow to detect new metabolic abnormalities in patients with complex neurological diseases.","It is now established that most inborn errors of metabolism may present in adulthood as a neurological disorder. The diagnosis of these diseases is essential because, unlike the so-called neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases are often accessible to specific treatments.

Conversely, many patients are followed for a complex neurological disease of unknown cause. We hypothesize that a significant proportion of these patients carry yet undetected inborn error of metabolism.

Recently, the use of Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) has uncovered new metabolic diseases leading sometimes to specific treatments. However, the place of this technique in the investigation of patients with complex neurological diseases remains to be determined.

The primary goal of this project is to assess the interest of NMRS in urine and CSF to search metabolic abnormalities, not detected by conventional biochemical techniques. It is an open study.

This approach is currently limited by the fact that techniques aiming at identifying abnormal metabolites in human fluids (metabolomics) only detect subsets of molecules and that no general assays is available to detect abnormalities in the metabolism of complex molecules that takes place within cell organelles. As a consequence, only limited parts of the metabolism can be studied simultaneously. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether NRM spectroscopy of body fluids (urines, cerebrospinal fluid) could allow to detect new metabolic abnormalities in patients with complex neurological diseases. It is now established that most inborn errors of metabolism may present in adulthood as a neurological disorder. The diagnosis of these diseases is essential because, unlike the so-called neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases are often accessible to specific treatments. Conversely, many patients are followed for a complex neurological disease of unknown cause. We hypothesize that a significant proportion of these patients carry yet undetected inborn error of metabolism. Recently, the use of Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) has uncovered new metabolic diseases leading sometimes to specific treatments.

* In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a device creates a short-lasting magnetic field which induces an electric current in the brain leading to a change in the activity of brain cells. There are different effects on the brain with different rates of stimulation. In a previous study in people with Parkinson's disease, repetitive TMS (rTMS) given at a particular rate temporarily improved their ability to walk. A faster rate of rTMS may be more effective in treating symptoms than the rate originally used.
* This study will compare active rTMS to inactive (sham or Placebo) rTMS. Half of the people in this study will have active rTMS; the other half will have no brain stimulation with rTMS.

Objectives:

- To see if a faster rate of transcranial magnetic stimulation is a more effective treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease than the slower rates that have been studied.

Eligibility:

* Individuals between 40 and 80 years of age who have been diagnosed with mild or moderate Parkinson's disease.
* Participants must currently be taking Sinemet or dopamine agonists drugs (e.g., bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, apomorophine, and rotigotine), and are willing to continue their same treatments for the duration of the study.

Design:

* This study requires 11 outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center over 6 weeks. Participants can also be admitted and stay as an inpatient in the NIH Clinical Center for the entire study period (for the 10 visits during the first weeks and the follow-up visit a month later).
* Initial visit will consist of a physical examination; a test of participants' time to walk 10 meters; and questions about memory, mood, and quality of life. Participants should not take Parkinson's disease medications for 12 hours before this visit; once the examinations and tests are complete, participants will be able to take the medications. Researchers will repeat the tests 1 hour after participants take the medication.
* TMS sessions: 8 TMS sessions (4 sessions per week) over 2 weeks. Each stimulation session will last half an hour. Half of the participants will receive active TMS; the other half will receive sham TMS.
* The first 10 participants will have additional tests to study the safety of rapid TMS in patients with Parkinson's disease.
* A day after completing the last TMS session, participants will repeat the same tests as the first visit before and after taking their medication as in the first assessment and respond to questions about mood, memory, and quality of life.
* One month after completing the last TMS session, participants will repeat the same tests as the first visit before and after taking their medication.","Objective:

Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust,OTHER_GOV,NCT04713579,Timing of Stoma Closure in Neonates,Timing of Stoma Closure in Neonates (ToSCiN),"Some babies require emergency surgery on their tummy in the first few months of life. This is most commonly because they were born prematurely and developed a bowel problem (called NEC) or a blockage of the bowel. As part of this surgery, the ends of the bowel may be brought to the skin surface (called a stoma) to divert stool into a bag. The stoma allows time for the bowel to rest and recover and is intended to be temporary with reversal later on. The best time to reverse or ""close"" the stoma is unknown. Stomas may cause dehydration, poor growth and skin problems so earlier closure may be better; however surgery is safer when babies are older and bigger so later closure may be better.

This study aims to answer the question, 'is it feasible to conduct a clinical trial comparing 'early' vs. 'late' stoma closure in neonates?' It has a series of specific objectives which incorporate: (i) describing current UK practice; (ii) establishing whether or not a clinical trial (and exactly what form of trial) is acceptable to parents and clinicians; and (iii) establishing the design of a potential trial, including defining the intervention ('early vs. late') and the population of infants to be included, how infants should be recruited and what information should be collected (outcomes).

The investigators will ask parents and health professionals for their views and whether they would take part in a future trial and information about babies who have recently had a stoma to find out which factors influence the timing of closure. They will also analyse 6 years of data from an existing database, the National Neonatal Research Database to estimate the numbers of babies affected, understand current practice and outcomes for these babies to help decide whether a clinical trial is possible.","Neonates undergoing emergency abdominal surgery frequently require stoma formation. Reversing (closing) these stomas with a second operation is an essential part of the infant's recovery. The timing of this closure is highly variable around the United Kingdom (UK) and the best time remains unclear. Current evidence is of low methodological quality and presents mixed conclusions: determining the best time has significant potential benefits for: (i) infant health outcomes (short-term e.g. avoiding complications and long-term e.g. growth and neurodevelopment); ii) families (e.g. reduced Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay); and iii) healthcare providers (e.g. reduced costs). Ideally, a clinical trial to compare early and late closure would be conducted but this is likely to be challenging and may not be feasible or acceptable to parents and clinicians.

Aims and objectives:

This study aims to answer the question, 'is it feasible to conduct a clinical trial comparing 'early' vs. 'late' stoma closure in neonates?' It has a series of specific objectives which incorporate: (i) describing current UK practice; (ii) establishing whether or not a clinical trial (and exactly what form of trial) is acceptable to parents and clinicians; and (iii) establishing the design of a potential trial, including defining the intervention ('early vs. late') and the population of infants to be included, how infants should be recruited and what information should be collected (outcomes).

Methods:

The study will use a mixed-methods approach comprising three parallel workstreams (WS). WS 1 will be a national survey of clinician perspectives of neonatal stoma closure. WS 2 will use an observational cohort study, interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. WS 3 will analyse three existing large databases (National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD), Health Episode Statistics (HES) and British Association of Paediatric Surgeons Congenital Anomalies Surveillance System (BAPS-CASS)).

The findings of these WS will be combined and presented at a final, trial design meeting where conclusions about trial feasibility will be reached and if appropriate, an outline of a trial protocol agreed.

Anticipated impact and dissemination:

The principal impact will be determining whether or not a definitive trial can go ahead: if the study demonstrates that a trial is feasible then the investigators will use their findings to design a trial that is acceptable to parents and clinicians; that includes the most appropriate infants; that measures outcomes important to parents and clinicians and ultimately, answers the question: when is the best time to close an infant's stoma? Findings will be disseminated at national meetings of relevant professionals, through social media (including patient groups), to funding bodies and in open access publications.","Workstream 1

Kaiser Permanente,OTHER,NCT05359679,Can Value Champions Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing for People With Dementia?,Impact Collaboratory Transforming Dementia Care - Can Value Champions Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing for People With Dementia?,"The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of training a clinician to be a 'value champion' within clinical settings to decrease the use of three classes of potentially inappropriate prescription medications (PIMs) among people living with dementia (PLWD). Secondary objectives include determining if the intervention is associated with a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations due to a fall, and examining five implementation outcomes: appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and equity.

This study is a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial to test the effectiveness of a primary care clinician value champion for de-implementing PIMs among patients 65 years of age and older with a diagnosis of dementia. Medicare Part D pharmacy claims data will be analyzed at the end of the 12-month intervention for the primary outcome, the medication possession rates (MPR) for three groups of potentially inappropriate medications: antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, and hypoglycemic medications (sulfonylureas and insulin). In a similar fashion, a hospital admission, or an emergency department visit for a fall will be assessed at the end of the intervention using Medicare claims data. Finally, the five implementation outcomes will be evaluated at the end of the intervention from notes entered by the value champions in project workbooks.

Primary care clinics within each of the two participating ACOs will be randomized to either the intervention or control arms of the study. Prior to random assignment, the investigators will stratify practices based on high versus low historic prescribing rates. A primary care clinician from each clinic selected for the trial in the intervention arm (n=30 across the two ACOs) will be recruited as a clinician value champion for each intervention clinic. The clinician value champion will participate in twice monthly value champion web-based training sessions for six months and then launch a 12-month initiative within the clinician value champions' clinics to reduce PIM prescribing among PLWD. Study outcomes will be assessed 12 months after the clinician value champions launch the initiative.

The hypothesis is that for each medication class, the intervention will produce clinically relevant decreases in mean possession rates of 10% of a standard deviation in patients seen in intervention clinics compared to those who are seen in control group clinics.","Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus:

For people living with dementia (PLWD) the overuse of Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIMs), those for which the potential for harm outweighs benefit, remains a persistent problem despite evidence-based guidelines supporting de-adoption. A group of geriatric experts convened by the Choosing Wisely initiative identified three classes of PIMs for PLWD: antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and hypoglycemics (sulfonylureas and insulin) with adequate glycemic control. In a systematic review the prevalence of PIMs when cognitive impairment was reported ranged from 20.6% to 80.5%. Approximately 14.3% of Medicare Part D enrollees with dementia residing in the general community are prescribed an antipsychotic. The prevalence of potentially inappropriate benzodiazepine prescriptions has been reported to be as high as 20% among elderly persons with dementia living in the community. The proportion of elderly patients with an A1c \< 7% who received a prescription for sulfonylurea, insulin or combined insulin and sulfonylurea therapies was 35.2%, 24.2% and 16.3% respectively and was as prevalent in those with dementia as in those without. Park and colleagues compared rates of prescribing low-value medications in the elderly from 2006-2015 in both traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Not only was there no difference in rates between the two groups, there was also no evidence of any decline in rates of prescribing over time, including use of benzodiazepines in PLWD.

Study Rationale:

The rationale for decreasing the use of PIMs is that use in this population of patients results in a greater likelihood of harm than benefit. Documented harms in the medical literature includes falls, worsening cognitive impairment, hospital admission, functional impairment, and death.

Name and Description of the Intervention:

One clinician value champion from each clinic randomized to the intervention arm will complete a value champion training program led by the P.I. and then implement care redesign activities in the clinical practice setting to reduce the use of low value prescribing in older adults with dementia. The 6-month training phase will consist of twice monthly web-based training sessions. A recently completed Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)-funded Value Champion Fellowship program resulted in the development of a training curriculum comprised of 10 learning modules for the training phase of the intervention and a project workbook to guide clinician value champions during the 12-month project phase. Following the 6 months of training, clinician value champions will participate in a monthly 1-hour shared learning sessions via video conference to share successes, challenges, and brainstorm solutions for 12 months (months 10-22 of the study). The investigators will invite former value champion fellows and faculty from the RWJF fellowship to participate in these meetings to support this new cohort of value champions.","Inclusion Criteria - clinician practices:

Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins,OTHER,NCT01728779,Stereotactic Body Radiation With Nelfinavir for Oligometastases,Single-Arm Phase II Study of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Concurrent With Nelfinavir for Oligometastases,"Patients with metastatic lesions of the lung, liver, or bone will be candidates for treatment. Within three weeks of the initial treatment planning, a 15 Gy dose (per lesion site) of SBRT will be administered. Prior to SBRT, patients will initiate Nelfinavir oral therapy twice daily for 7 days. Once SBRT is completed, the patient will repeat the same Nelfinavir therapy for an additional 7 days for a total of 14 days of treatment.","The use of radiation therapy to treat metastatic tumors is well established and promising data are emerging with the use of SBRT for metastatic disease. However, the use of a single large fraction concurrent with a radiosensitizer as is being proposed is not of proven benefit. This investigation aims to confirm the safety and efficacy for SBRT used concurrently with a radiosensitizer in the setting of oligometastatic disease. The dose selected has been chosen with the belief that it is safe and effective based on prior experience with SBRT of lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and brain radiosurgery. All patients will be treated with a single fraction (per lesion site), targeted to the lesion concurrently with the radiosensitizer Nelfinavir.

On the basis of this preclinical evidence, we propose a phase II study of Nelfinavir combined with SBRT in patients with oligometastatic disease. Because the standard dose of Nelfinavir for HIV patients is known to be safe and does inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt and decrease tumor hypoxia, we propose to study this in conjunction with a 15 Gy dose of SBRT. Experience with single-fraction pulmonary and pancreas SBRT provides a useful dose for this trial. With published data establishing the relative safety of large single-fraction SBRT to the lungs and pancreas, we have decided to proceed to determine the safety of 15 Gy SBRT concurrently with the radiosensitizer Nelfinavir. Once this is established, we propose to continue to enroll more patients to the study at this dose to determine the efficacy of this type of therapy.

The proposed study represents an informed estimate based on current knowledge of SBRT doses and those administered in currently approved image-guided protocols (brain, base of skull, cervico-thoracic spine, pancreas and liver). This study will refine the current understanding of single fraction radiation tolerance for normal tissues, thereby making it possible to treat future patients more safely and aggressively.","Inclusion Criteria

Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving irinotecan together with temozolomide works in treating young patients with recurrent neuroblastoma.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with relapsed neuroblastoma (NB) treated with irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide.
* Determine the toxicities associated with irinotecan and temozolomide in patients treated with this regimen.

Secondary

* Evaluate the impact of p53 loss of function on response rate and event-free survival from start of relapse therapy.
* Collect data for ongoing analyses of UGT1A1 polymorphisms in these patients.
* Collect and bank serum and nucleic acid specimen to facilitate future biomarker studies.
* Evaluate the feasibility of collecting blood samples on a group wide basis for assessment of changes in circulating markers of angiogenesis.
* Assess, preliminarily, the effects of irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide on circulating markers of angiogenesis.

National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH),NIH,NCT00012584,Treatment of Youth With ADHD and Anxiety,A Treatment Study of Youth With Comorbid Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Anxiety Disorders,"The purpose of this NIMH-sponsored pilot study is to collect information on the efficacy and safety of drug treatments for children and adolescents who suffer from both ADHD and anxiety disorders. Specifically, the study will examine the benefits of the stimulant medication both alone and in combination with fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has antianxiety effects. Young people aged 6 to 17 diagnosed with these co-occurring disorders may be eligible to participate.","Many children and adolescents with mental disorders in the United States are treated with multiple psychotropic medications even though there is not much information on how well these medications work together or if they are safe to administer together. Many youth with ADHD have co-occurring (comorbid) disorders such as oppositional-defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. There is much interest in the treatment of children and adolescents with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorders because this is a common condition in clinical practice. When children with both anxiety and ADHD receive stimulant medication for ADHD, their anxiety may not improve. SSRI medications represent a reasonable addition to stimulant treatment, as they are considered effective for anxiety disorders based on controlled trials in adults and open trials in children. However, there are no data from controlled studies regarding the tolerability and dosing of the combination of stimulant treatment (including methylphenidate) and SSRIs in the treatment of children with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorder.

In this study, children and adolescents will be evaluated for the presence of both ADHD and Anxiety Disorder. Approximately 120 children and adolescents with both disorders who meet all the study entry requirements (such as being otherwise medically healthy) will be enrolled. Children and adolescents who are not on a stable dose of a stimulant will first be treated openly with methylphenidate for 6 weeks. Those whose ADHD does not improve during this initial treatment period will not continue in the study but will be referred for further support in the community. Those who show improvement in both their ADHD and anxiety symptoms will stay on methylphenidate for an additional 8 weeks. Those who show improvement in ADHD but not anxiety will be asked to enter the double-blind phase of the study. In this phase, participants will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive either fluvoxamine or placebo, in combination with stimulant/methylphenidate, for 8 weeks. Children or adolescents who enter the study on a stable dose of stimulant will move directly to the Double-Blind phase. Participants who are assigned to placebo and who do not show an improvement in anxiety after 8 weeks will be eligible for an additional 8 weeks of open treatment with the methylphenidate/stimulant and fluvoxamine combination. At the end of the trial, clinical care will be provided for up to an additional month until referral to an outside clinician can be arranged.","* ADHD diagnosis

Specifically, the study will examine the benefits of the stimulant medication both alone and in combination with fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has antianxiety effects. Young people aged 6 to 17 diagnosed with these co-occurring disorders may be eligible to participate. Many children and adolescents with mental disorders in the United States are treated with multiple psychotropic medications even though there is not much information on how well these medications work together or if they are safe to administer together. Many youth with ADHD have co-occurring (comorbid) disorders such as oppositional-defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. There is much interest in the treatment of children and adolescents with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorders because this is a common condition in clinical practice. When children with both anxiety and ADHD receive stimulant medication for ADHD, their anxiety may not improve. SSRI medications represent a reasonable addition to stimulant treatment, as they are considered effective for anxiety disorders based on controlled trials in adults and open trials in children. However, there are no data from controlled studies regarding the tolerability and dosing of the combination of stimulant treatment (including methylphenidate) and SSRIs in the treatment of children with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorder. In this study, children and adolescents will be evaluated for the presence of both ADHD and Anxiety Disorder. Approximately 120 children and adolescents with both disorders who meet all the study entry requirements (such as being otherwise medically healthy) will be enrolled. Children and adolescents who are not on a stable dose of a stimulant will first be treated openly with methylphenidate for 6 weeks. Those whose ADHD does not improve during this initial treatment period will not continue in the study but will be referred for further support in the community. Those who show improvement in both their ADHD and anxiety symptoms will stay on methylphenidate for an additional 8 weeks. Those who show improvement in ADHD but not anxiety will be asked to enter the double-blind phase of the study. In this phase, participants will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive either fluvoxamine or placebo, in combination with stimulant/methylphenidate, for 8 weeks. Children or adolescents who enter the study on a stable dose of stimulant will move directly to the Double-Blind phase. Participants who are assigned to placebo and who do not show an improvement in anxiety after 8 weeks will be eligible for an additional 8 weeks of open treatment with the methylphenidate/stimulant and fluvoxamine combination. At the end of the trial, clinical care will be provided for up to an additional month until referral to an outside clinician can be arranged. * ADHD diagnosis * DSM-IV diagnosis of anxiety * IQ greater than 70 * residence with primary caretaker for at least 6 months * ages 6-17 and attending school * no previous treatment failure to or intolerance of fluvoxamine or methylphenidate (unless currently taking another stimulant)"

Carbiotix AB has developed, a corn fiber extract containing arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS), which have great potential for improving gut health. In this project, it will be investigated whether the intake of a hybrid product containing AXOS together with metformin can significantly improve glucose metabolism and gut health in patients with type 2 diabetes.","The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a high prevalence and the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The quality of life is significantly decreased in these patients and the costs for medical care are enormous. T2D patients are often treated with metformin, but adherence to the treatment is relatively poor, with gut dysbiosis as a major cause. Gut dysbiosis has not been addressed in the clinical setting although numerous studies support its role in disease development. There is an urgent need to improve existing treatments with metformin to improve adherence to drug therapy and the management of the disease. Prebiotics are dietary fibers that stimulate the growth and activity of beneficial gut microbiota. Prebiotics has been suggested as a medical food and might be very useful as an effective adjuvant approach in the management of T2D and other metabolic diseases. Carbiotix AB, a biotech company based in Lund, has developed a corn fiber extract containing arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS), which have great potential for improving gut health.

In this project, a clinical trial will be performed to investigate whether the corn fiber extract can significantly increase metformin adherence with improved gut health and glucose metabolism in patients with T2D. To maximize the potential efficacy of the intervention, a ""Hybrid Product"" containing arabinogalactan (AG), xylan-oligosaccharides (XOS), and AXOS will be used, building on the XOS and AXOS naturally present in the corn fiber extract.

One hundred subjects with T2D and treated with metformin will be recruited for this blind parallel randomized controlled intervention study. After a screening visit, the subjects will be randomized to test the Hybrid Product or placebo (maltodextrin) group. The duration of the intervention is 4 months, and the study subjects will be asked to consume the Hybrid Product or placebo daily (2x 5g). At the start, of week 8 and week 16, the study subjects will visit the study center for the measurement of body weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure. At these 3 visits, fasting blood samples are taken for analysis of glucose and insulin metabolism, blood lipids, and inflammation markers. Fecal samples are also collected to investigate the effect of the Hybrid Product on microbiota composition. At regular times during the study, the subjects must do a 7-point blood glucose monitoring and fill in questionnaires about gastrointestinal symptoms. During the whole study period, all subjects are contacted regularly to follow up on their health status.

If the Hybrid Product shows the strong potential to improve adherence to metformin treatment, this will lead to improving diabetes care with reduced economic consequences. The promotion of a healthy gut by consumption of soluble fibers also helps to support immune function, blood sugar regulation, increased nutrient uptake (e.g. vitamin B12), and better body weight control. These health benefits will undoubtedly result in better well-being in private and working life and thus in a significantly improved quality of life for patients with T2D.

Swanson Center,OTHER,NCT02196779,Laser Fluorescent Imaging of Abdominal Skin During Abdominoplasty,Laser Fluorescent Imaging of Abdominal Skin During Abdominoplasty,"Abdominoplasty is a common cosmetic operation. Some investigators believe that the risk of complications is reduced by limiting the operative dissection. However, this can compromise the quality of the result. This study was undertaken to investigate the blood supply of the abdominoplasty skin flap during surgery using laser fluorescent imaging. An imaging agent is injected and the fluorescence is recorded using a near-infrared laser. The blood supply is tested after a limited dissection and then after a traditional dissection to determine whether an extended dissection reduces the skin circulation. The study hypothesis is that there is no difference in blood supply and the traditional abdominoplasty does not compromise skin circulation.","Protocol

Laser Fluorescent Imaging of Abdominal Skin During Abdominoplasty.

Background/Purpose

Abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) is a common cosmetic operation. One of the risks of surgery is delayed wound healing caused by impaired circulation to the skin. In an effort to reduce risk, some investigators1 advocate a limited-undermining technique, with preservation of the perforating blood vessels and preservation of the Scarpa fascia of the lower abdomen. However, there is no evidence that this limited-undermining technique improves blood supply compared with a traditional abdominoplasty dissection. Such a limited dissection may compromise the cosmetic result.

This study was undertaken to investigate the blood supply of the abdominal skin during the abdominoplasty procedure. By testing the circulation at two points during the dissection, and a third time after completion of the operation, data may be obtained and used to evaluate the effect of the extent of the dissection on blood supply of the skin flap.

Laser fluorescent imaging represents an objective measurement technique that has been used to quantitate blood supply in skin flaps and other tissues. It has been used for several years to monitor the vascularity of flaps used in breast reconstruction. This technique has also been used previously in patients undergoing abdominoplasty.2

Subjects

Twenty consecutive consenting adult men and women undergoing outpatient elective abdominoplasty will be investigated using laser fluorescent imaging. By testing the blood supply at three time points, the patient serves as his or her own control.

Imaging

The SPY Elite Intraoperative Perfusion Assessment System (Lifecell Corp., Branchburg, NJ) consists of a near-infrared laser that detects fluorescence. The imaging agent, indocyanine green, is absorbed at this region of the spectrum, 800-810 nm. The imaging agent is injected intravenously. Starting within 5-10 seconds of injection, the system records images of the abdomen, showing the fluorescence, which indicates blood supply. The half-life of the imaging agent is 2.5-3 minutes. The imaging agent is metabolized by the liver. The only known risk is an allergic reaction to the imaging agent. Patients with a history of an allergic reaction to iodinated contrast dyes are excluded.

Surgery

The lipoabdominoplasty technique is performed as described by Saldanha et al.1 Following this limited dissection, 3 mL (7.5 mg) of indocyanine green is injected and the abdominal image is recorded, documenting blood supply to the lower abdomen. After further dissection, another 3 mL of imaging agent is injected and the lower abdomen is re-imaged. On completion of surgery, a third injection is administered and a final image is recorded.

Null Hypothesis

A traditional abdominoplasty dissection does not compromise circulation compared with a more limited dissection technique.

Informed Consent

Patients are informed as to the nature of the study and are told that their participation is entirely voluntary and they are free to decline, and that doing so does not in any way prejudice their treatment. Patients are informed of the small risk of an allergic reaction that will be treated if it occurs.

Patient Risk

There is no patient risk apart from a very small risk of allergic reaction, which is further reduced by excluding any patient with a known allergy to iodinated contrast dye. The study does not affect patient treatment. It offers the possibility of detection of reduced skin circulation, information that can be used by the surgeon to limit the dissection if necessary and avoid tissue loss and delayed wound healing, known complications of abdominoplasty.

Sample Size

A sample of 20 patients is anticipated, treated over a period of approximately 6 months.

Some investigators believe that the risk of complications is reduced by limiting the operative dissection. However, this can compromise the quality of the result. This study was undertaken to investigate the blood supply of the abdominoplasty skin flap during surgery using laser fluorescent imaging. An imaging agent is injected and the fluorescence is recorded using a near-infrared laser. The blood supply is tested after a limited dissection and then after a traditional dissection to determine whether an extended dissection reduces the skin circulation. The study hypothesis is that there is no difference in blood supply and the traditional abdominoplasty does not compromise skin circulation. Protocol Laser Fluorescent Imaging of Abdominal Skin During Abdominoplasty. Background/Purpose Abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) is a common cosmetic operation. One of the risks of surgery is delayed wound healing caused by impaired circulation to the skin. In an effort to reduce risk, some investigators1 advocate a limited-undermining technique, with preservation of the perforating blood vessels and preservation of the Scarpa fascia of the lower abdomen. However, there is no evidence that this limited-undermining technique improves blood supply compared with a traditional abdominoplasty dissection. Such a limited dissection may compromise the cosmetic result. This study was undertaken to investigate the blood supply of the abdominal skin during the abdominoplasty procedure. By testing the circulation at two points during the dissection, and a third time after completion of the operation, data may be obtained and used to evaluate the effect of the extent of the dissection on blood supply of the skin flap. Laser fluorescent imaging represents an objective measurement technique that has been used to quantitate blood supply in skin flaps and other tissues. It has been used for several years to monitor the vascularity of flaps used in breast reconstruction. This technique has also been used previously in patients undergoing abdominoplasty.2 Subjects Twenty consecutive consenting adult men and women undergoing outpatient elective abdominoplasty will be investigated using laser fluorescent imaging. By testing the blood supply at three time points, the patient serves as his or her own control. Imaging The SPY Elite Intraoperative Perfusion Assessment System (Lifecell Corp., Branchburg, NJ) consists of a near-infrared laser that detects fluorescence. The imaging agent, indocyanine green, is absorbed at this region of the spectrum, 800-810 nm. The imaging agent is injected intravenously. Starting within 5-10 seconds of injection, the system records images of the abdomen, showing the fluorescence, which indicates blood supply. The half-life of the imaging agent is 2.5-3 minutes. The imaging agent is metabolized by the liver. The only known risk is an allergic reaction to the imaging agent. Patients with a history of an allergic reaction to iodinated contrast dyes are excluded. Surgery The lipoabdominoplasty technique is performed as described by Saldanha et al.1 Following this limited dissection, 3 mL (7.5 mg) of indocyanine green is injected and the abdominal image is recorded, documenting blood supply to the lower abdomen. After further dissection, another 3 mL of imaging agent is injected and the lower abdomen is re-imaged. On completion of surgery, a third injection is administered and a final image is recorded. Null Hypothesis A traditional abdominoplasty dissection does not compromise circulation compared with a more limited dissection technique. Informed Consent Patients are informed as to the nature of the study and are told that their participation is entirely voluntary and they are free to decline, and that doing so does not in any way prejudice their treatment. Patients are informed of the small risk of an allergic reaction that will be treated if it occurs. Patient Risk There is no patient risk apart from a very small risk of allergic reaction, which is further reduced by excluding any patient with a known allergy to iodinated contrast dye. The study does not affect patient treatment. It offers the possibility of detection of reduced skin circulation, information that can be used by the surgeon to limit the dissection if necessary and avoid tissue loss and delayed wound healing, known complications of abdominoplasty. Sample Size A sample of 20 patients is anticipated, treated over a period of approximately 6 months.

Federico II University,OTHER,NCT06757179,The ELYAR (Elysium Against Rhinitis) Project,"Evaluation of the Therapeutic Effect of a Formulation Based on Mullein, Thyme, Propolis, and Long-Chain Polyphosphates in Children Diagnosed with Acute Rhinitis","Acute rhinitis is an inflammatory process that primarily affects the nasal mucosa, with a high incidence in the pediatric population and a morbidity rate of 6-8 episodes annually during the first two years of schooling (1). It is one of the most common conditions causing discomfort and debilitation in children, compromising their quality of life, negatively affecting social interactions, school performance, and sleep quality. In most cases, the origin is viral and the course is seasonal, with higher incidence in the autumn and winter seasons (1).

More than 100 viral strains are known to be responsible for this condition, among which Rhinoviruses are considered the most widespread and contagious (2). Symptoms, which typically begin 1-2 days after infection, include nasal congestion, nasal breathing obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, coughing, headache, malaise, and sometimes mild fever, with complete remission generally occurring within 8-10 days (2).

The therapeutic approach is exclusively symptomatic, mainly aimed at reducing nasal obstruction. Literature indicates that nasal irrigation with saline solution is the most useful treatment for cleansing the nasal passages, thinning nasal secretions, and allowing for easier elimination; in the presence of fever, antipyretics may be useful (3).

Given these premises, the aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an isotonic saline solution containing mullein, thyme, propolis, and long-chain polyphosphates, which are known for their natural properties to promote nasal secretion fluidity, reduce inflammation, and improve the functionality of the upper respiratory mucosa (4). In addition, more recent pre-clinical data suggested that this formulation exerts an antiviral action characterized by inhibition of virus replication (Rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2) and an anti-inflammatory action through modulation of NF-Kb signaling in cultured human nasal respiratory epithelial cells.

Lady Davis Institute,OTHER,NCT04335279,Evaluation of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together Program,A Partially Nested RCT to Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Program to Reduce Anxiety Among At-Risk Scleroderma Patients,"Contagious disease outbreaks, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, and associated restrictions to prevent spread can lead to negative psychological outcomes, including loneliness, depression, and anxiety, particularly in vulnerable populations at risk due to existing medical conditions. To date, no randomized controlled trials have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and excessive collagen production. Systemic Sclerosis can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Many people with scleroderma are at risk of serious complications from COVID-19 if infected due to lung involvement (\> 40% have interstitial lung disease) and common use of immunosuppressant drugs.

The objective of The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate a videoconference-based intervention designed to improve symptoms of anxiety and other mental health outcomes among individuals with systemic sclerosis at risk of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that will be conducted using an existing cohort of systemic sclerosis patients. We will use a partially nested design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support.","Background: Social distancing and movement restrictions during contagious disease outbreaks are necessary to reduce spread but can lead to negative social and psychological outcomes, including loneliness, depression, and anxiety, particularly in vulnerable populations. An online survey that used snowball sampling techniques and collected data from 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China in January-February 2020 found that over 50% rated the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as moderate or severe. Symptoms of anxiety were rated as the most common psychological problem. Self-reported poor physical health status and the presence of a chronic illness were associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and excessive collagen production. Onset typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years, and approximately 80% of people with SSc are women. SSc can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Disease presentation is extremely heterogeneous, and the course of the disease is highly unpredictable. People with SSc commonly experience hand function and mobility limitations, pain, fatigue, sleep problems, pruritus, symptoms of depression, and body image distress from disfiguring aspects (e.g., skin tightening, pigment changes, hand contractures, telangiectasias). Many people with SSc are at risk of serious complications from COVID-19 if infected due to lung involvement (\> 40% have interstitial lung disease) and common use of immunosuppressant drugs.

The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Program is a group videoconference-based intervention designed to improve symptoms of anxiety and other mental health outcomes among individuals with SSc at risk of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective of the SPIN-CHAT Trial is to evaluate the effect of the program compared to waitlist control on patient reported symptoms of anxiety as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety 4a v1.0 scores.

Recruitment and Enrolment: SPIN is a collaboration of SSc researchers, health care providers, people living with SSc, and patient organizations from Canada, the United States, Europe, Mexico and Australia that has assembled a large multinational patient cohort to collect longitudinal data on patient-reported outcomes in SSc and as a framework for embedding RCTs of e-health interventions. SPIN Cohort participants complete online assessments upon enrolment and at 3-month intervals. To date, over 2000 SSc patients from 47 centres have been enrolled in SPIN's web-based cohort (currently approximately 1800 active participants).

SPIN Cohort participants will be invited by email and by popups to enrol in the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Additionally, recruitment announcements for the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort will be posted on SPIN's social media and distributed through our patient organization partners. All SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants will be invited to complete measures at baseline and every two weeks for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. They will receive email reminders to complete bi-weekly follow-up assessments.

Participants in the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort eligible for the SPIN-CHAT Trial will be provided with a brief description of the trial in the SPIN-COVID-19 Qualtrics platform and will be asked if they would be interested in participating in the trial. Those who express interest will be provided with an online version of the trial consent form, which they can also download, and will be given the options of (1) consenting to participate; (2) declining participation; or (3) requesting that a member of SPIN's research team call them to answer questions they have about participating in the trial before consenting.

Methods: The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic, two-arm partially nested RCT (PN-RCT) that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort. Pragmatic RCTs are conducted to replicate real-world delivery of interventions as much as possible and support decisions on whether interventions should be provided in practice. The trial will be a PN-RCT because participants randomised to the intervention arm will be clustered into intervention groups, and members of each intervention group will interact during videoconference sessions; participants randomly assigned to the waitlist control will not be clustered and will only complete trial measures.

Random Selection and Allocation: SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants who provide consent for participation will be entered into different pools based on their availabilities and taking into consideration time zone differences. Once there are enough participants to complete an intervention group and assign an equal number of participants to waitlist control, SPIN personnel will provide the external service with an anonymised list of participants (only identification numbers will be provided) who could participate in an intervention group based on language and day and time availabilities. For each intervention group and waitlist control pairing, the service will randomly select 16 participants from the pool of enroled participants available based on language, day, and time and will randomly allocate 8 to the intervention group and 8 to the waitlist group using block randomization.This process will be repeated until trial enrolment is complete. One intervention and waitlist control pairing will include 18 participants (9 intervention, 9 waitlist) to accommodate the total number that we anticipate randomizing.

Intervention and Comparator: Mental health outcomes, including anxiety, among people in quarantine are associated with modifiable factors such as degree of isolation, boredom, and ability to manage worry and anxiety. In addition to psychological strategies, including worry reduction and meditative exercises, exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety. Among older adults, where isolation is a common challenge, activity and social engagement are commonly used to address loneliness and feelings of isolation. Recommendations for the World Health Organization and major national public health organizations for managing mental health during COVID-19 emphasize setting and following a routine, managing information sources and quantity, staying connected with others, and finding a way to be physically active.

The SPIN-CHAT Program is a brief group videoconference intervention that was developed based on best-practice principles for managing anxiety and worry, recommendations for maintaining mental health during COVID-19, and input from the SPIN COVID-19 Patient Advisory Team. Educational segments in each session will be delivered by a research team member with experience and training related to the topic. Leisure activities that will be done at the start of each session will include games (e.g., Pictionary, charades), creative activities (e.g., roll-a-story), cultural activities (e.g., virtual museum tours), social activities (e.g., share your favourite recipe). In the healthy information management and social connection segment, strategies will be provided and discussion will be facilitated on how to stay informed via accurate information sources while avoiding sensationalist and other non-helpful information. Information on using simple (e.g., phone) or more advanced technology (e.g., group videoconferencing) to stay connected will be discussed, along with strategies for connecting regularly with others. The managing worry segments will include an overview of worry, including what it is, the difference between helpful and harmful anxiety or worry, how to identify triggers of worry, and strategies to manage worry, including identifying different types of worrying, using worry journals, worry postponement, and worry time. Exercises will be done with the group to illustrate techniques. In the relaxation segments, an introduction to the purpose of relaxation techniques will be presented, and participants will be guided through brief breathing, mindfulness, and visualization exercises.

The physical activity segments will include an overview of the physical and psychosocial benefits of physical activity for maintenance of health for chronic disease management, including mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic; movement guidelines to ensure safety; and how to monitor daily physical activity. Participants will be guided through movement options for the home-based setting, including warm-ups, aerobic, and strength activities. Behaviour change techniques to foster building the habit of moving more at home will be taught, including goal-setting, scheduling, addressing barriers, and building social support.

Activity engagement sessions will be guided by the leisure education content model. Sessions will involve interactive group discussion about the benefits of leisure engagement for persons with SSc, addressing physical, social, emotional, intellectual and spiritual realms of health and wellbeing. Sessions will explore barriers to leisure for persons with SSc and includes tips for finding leisure resources within the participants' own homes, both in-person and online.

Sample Size: Effects of short anxiety-focused interventions in post-disaster settings are between 0.40 and 0.80 standardized mean difference (SMD). This is larger than estimated minimally important difference for the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 score (SMD = 0.23 to 0.34 SMD). For an assumed effect size of SMD = 0.50, a two-tailed test with alpha = 0.05, and an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, N=146 provides 80% power or greater for our primary outcome, PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0; assuming 10% dropout, we will recruit 162 participants (81 in 10 SPIN-CHAT groups; 81 waitlist). We believe that this is a conservative power and sample size estimate. First, in cluster RCTs, ICC values for individual patient outcomes are typically lower than our 0.05 estimate. If the true ICC is lower than our 0.05 estimate, this will result in greater power than estimated. Second, there has been no loss to follow-up in the feasibility trial or initial waves of our full-scale trial of the videoconference-based SPIN support group leader program, which has a similar design. Thus, we believe that a 10% loss to follow-up may be conservative.

Data Analysis: Analyses will be conducted by a statistician blind to trial arm allocation. For the primary outcome analysis, we will use an intent-to-treat analysis that compares all patients randomly assigned to the SPIN-CHAT Program to all patients assigned to the waitlist control. The intervention effect at 4 weeks will be estimated using a linear mixed model, adjusted for baseline PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scores. The model will include a random effect to account for clustering of participants in the training groups, but not for participants in the waitlist control arm, because there is no clustering in the control arm. We will investigate the effects of missing data using multiple imputation. As a secondary analysis, we will additionally adjust for age, sex, baseline loneliness, baseline boredom, and baseline physical activity. Analyses of secondary outcomes will similarly be done (1) controlling for baseline scores only and (2) controlling for baseline scores, age, sex, and other key baseline measures. Statistical significance for all analyses will be determined based on two-sided α = 0.05. In addition, we will use complier-average causal effect analysis to estimate effects among patients who use the intervention compared to similar patients in the waitlist arm of the trial.","Inclusion Criteria:

KU Leuven,OTHER,NCT05419284,Feasibility of the Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg With Caregiver Involvement,Feasibility of the Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg With the Informal Caregiver as Exercise Partner of the Physiotherapist (GAPP+Care),"This interventional study aims to see if involving caregivers as exercise partners with the physiotherapist throughout in-hospital geriatric rehabilitation and the first six weeks following discharge is feasible.

Caregivers will receive hands-on training from physiotherapists so that they can assist their family members with their exercises. The caregivers will provide 30-minute exercise sessions three times each week in addition to the standard physiotherapy.

The researchers want to know how many people are eligible for GAPP+CARE and how willing they are to participate. The researchers also want to know about the program's hindering and facilitating elements, as well as its fidelity and retention rate. Apart from that, the researchers want to examine if an effectiveness study and the used outcome measures are viable.","To meet the WHO guideline for daily exercise during and after hospitalization, physiotherapists must find ways for geriatric patients to be active outside of therapy time. Geriatric patients require assistance or supervision to exercise safely, yet physiotherapists and nurses are short on time. Instead, by providing carers with tools and instruction, the researchers might turn them into exercise partners for the physiotherapist.

The investigators designed an exercise program (GAPP+Care) customized to the caregiver's ability to exercise safely with their loved one, based on the ideas and exercises of our standard physiotherapy program, the Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg (GAPP). Through semi-structured interviews, patients and their caregivers were involved in developing and validating GAPP+Care, including the exercise booklet.

GAPP+Care consists of GAPP (the usual physiotherapy treatment) and three additional 30-minute exercise sessions with the caregiver each week (+Care). +Care will continue at home for the first six weeks after discharge, and GAPP will be replaced with physiotherapy performed by a private physiotherapist, as described at discharge (a prescription for home physiotherapy 3 times a week, for 60 sessions F-pathology or 18 sessions).

The initial +Care session is with a ward physiotherapist who will show the caregiver how to utilize the GAPP+Care handbook and the exercises and teach them how to support the patient during the exercises. During hospitalization, one of the three weekly sessions will be led by a ward physiotherapist to reinforce the hands-on skills and knowledge. These physiotherapy-patient-caregiver sessions will consist of two home visits and four phone calls after the patient has been discharged.

The goal of this exploratory study is to see if GAPP+Care is feasible. The researchers want to know how many people are eligible and how willing they are to participate.

GlaxoSmithKline,INDUSTRY,NCT01681979,WEUSRTP4850: Phase II: ICS/LABA Use in Pregnancy and Outcomes,WEUSRTP4850: Phase II: Asthma Treatment in Pregnancy and the Frequency of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes,"Asthma is reported to affect between 3-14% of pregnancies making asthma medicines one of the most commonly used classes of medicines during pregnancy. Maternal asthma and in particular poorly controlled asthma has been found to be associated with a number of adverse perinatal outcomes including preterm delivery, low birth weight and pre-eclampsia. At present little is known about the safety in humans of many anti-asthma medicines when used during pregnancy. As a result all inhaled corticosteroids, with the exception of budesonide which is category B, have an FDA pregnancy category C, indicative of the fact there are no adequate and well controlled studies in humans.

Fluticasone propionate is an inhaled corticosteroid used for the treatment of asthma, often in combination with the long-acting β-agonist salmeterol. Owing to small numbers of pregnancy exposures in the past, little is known about the safety of fluticasone propionate when used during pregnancy. A recent feasibility study, however, has shown that there are sufficient numbers of first trimester exposed pregnancies on the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) to allow the overall risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) to be evaluated. This study also demonstrated that using data from the GPRD it is possible to determine an individual's exposure to anti-asthma medicines during pregnancy and to classify her treatment in terms of the British Thoracic Society treatment steps based on linked prescription and primary care data.

The aims of this study are to 1) evaluate the safety profile of fluticasone propionate (FP) compared with exposure to all other inhaled corticosteroids with all major congenital malformations combined as the primary endpoint, whilst taking into account potential confounders and exposure to other anti-asthma medicine; and 2) test the null hypothesis that exposure to fluticasone propionate during the first trimester of pregnancy is not associated with increased overall risk of all major congenital malformations when compared to the risk in those exposed to other inhaled corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy.

The study will be a retrospective cohort study and will use data from the United Kingdom's General Practice Research Database (GPRD). The GPRD contains longitudinal medical records collected within UK primary care. All medical symptoms and diagnoses are recorded in the database, including those relating to pregnancy, in the form of Read Codes. In addition to coded data GPs have the option of recording un-coded comments ('free text'), such as more detailed descriptions of diagnoses or treatments along with information provided to them via hospital letters, referrals and discharge summaries.

As the recording of stillbirths, neonatal deaths and pre-term births on the GPRD has not been verified, a verification exercise will be carried out. This will involve requesting and reviewing free text comments for 100 stillbirths, 100 neonatal deaths and 100 pre-term births. Free text comments will be requested if they are associated with a medical code related to pregnancy, delivery, post natal visits, death, post mortem, hospital letters and other forms of communication. If the free text is not found to be informative we will send questionnaires to the woman's GP.

All outcomes will be identified and verified blinded to asthma treatment and severity levels.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

German Diabetes Center,OTHER,NCT01397279,Assessment of Liver Glucose Metabolism in Diabetic Subjects,Assessment of Liver Glucose Metabolism in Diabetic Subjects,Type 2 diabetes is associated with hepatic insulin resistance. One consequence of insulin resistance of the liver is an altered hepatic glucose metabolism. This study investigates whether the whole body (M-value) and hepatic insulin sensitivity obtained by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp is influenced by a preceding intravenous glucose tolerance test (Botnia Clamp) in subjects with type 2 diabetes.,"The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp represents the gold standard for measuring peripheral insulin sensitivity. The insulin sensitivity is described by the M-value,which is calculated from glucose infusion rates during the last 30min of the clamp.

Glucose is metabolised in the periphery: 50% by neural tissues, 20% by splanchnic bed and liver, 15% by skeletal muscle, 5% by adipose tissue and 10% by blood cells and other tissues. Under hyperinsulinemic conditions there is a strong shift in glucose utilization: 85% skeletal muscle and 15% by neural tissues, splanchnic bed and liver, adipose tissue, blood cells and other tissues. The contribution of skeletal muscle varies with different insulin sensitivity.

We now want to investigate whether there is a difference in tissue-specific insulin sensitivity measured from a Botnia clamp (intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivGTT) and following clamp) and a single hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp? After a 60min ivGTT blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic subjects are still elevated compared to baseline. High blood glucose levels can influence several parameters and may also affect insulin sensitivity. Until now, it is not proven, that the clamp preceding ivGTT does not have a significant influence on the M-value.","Inclusion Criteria:

University of Aarhus,OTHER,NCT02308384,A Trial of the Implementation of iFOBT in General Practice,The Use of Immunochemical Faecal Occult Blood Test (iFOBT) in General Practice. A Randomised Trial of the Implementation of iFOBT.,"Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common, and a leading cause of cancer death. The evaluation of patients suspected to have CRC is difficult due to poorly predictive alarm symptoms and many patients present with uncharacteristic or vague symptoms. The faecal marker of human globin, iFOBT, could play an important role in aiding the general practitioner in detecting CRC.

Hypothesis

It will be possible to implement iFOBT in general practice as a test performed on patients who do not fulfill the criteria for fast-track referral for colorectal cancer, but whose symptoms could indicate an undiagnosed colorectal cancer.

Aim

To implement iFOBT in general practice and evaluate the uptake and clinical use of the test. Furthermore, we want to investigate the performance of iFOBT when used on patients presenting with uncharacteristic symptoms of CRC, and the clinical implications.

Materials and methods

The study uses a cluster randomised stepped wedge design. Clusters are constituted by the 18 municipalities in the central Denmark Region, and these are randomised when to receive a continuous medical education (CME). The date of inclusion is defined as the first working day in the month the CME is planned to be conducted. The CME is part of an intervention aimed to facilitate the implementation of iFOBT in general practice. Besides a CME, the intervention consist of a start package (iFOBT kits, a guideline and online educational material) that is sent to GPs when they are included in the study, and a status mail that GPs receive approx. one month after inclusion. The inclusion period is during the first 7 month of the study period, the study lasts for one year.

Perspectives

This study will provide important knowledge on how to improve CRC diagnostics in general practice.","Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common type of cancer in Denmark and is a leading cause of cancer death. Since 2000, the incidence has been increasing by 1-1.5% each year. The estimated 5-year survival rate is currently 80% for stage I cancer, 50% for stages II and III, and \<5 % for stage IV cancer. These figures emphasize the importance of detecting the disease in early stages and underline the current challenge of diagnosing CRC in general practice.

In 2008, a national fast-track system for cancer patients was established to ensure fast diagnosis and initiation of treatment. The fast-track system implies that patients presenting 'alarm' symptoms of e.g. CRC will be referred immediately for diagnostic workup; no more than 14 days must pass from referral to initiation of treatment. Several studies have shown that the positive predictive values (PPV) of the symptoms regarding CRC are fairly low (4-8%). In addition, approximately 50% of new CRC incidents will present with other vague and uncharacteristic symptoms than alarm symptoms.

In addition, a screening programme for CRC has been implemented. It is suggested that this will increase survival rate of CRC, however, it is estimated that approximately 75% of yearly CRC still have to be diagnosed through general practice.

A huge load is, consequently, still placed on general practice in the quest for earlier diagnosis of CRC, and better methods to aid the general practitioner in the diagnostic process are needed.

One tool could be the use of iFOBT in general practice for patients who present with symptoms that could origin from an underlying CRC, but without being alarm symptoms.

Aim

To implement iFOBT in general practice and evaluate the uptake and clinical use of the test. Furthermore, we want to investigate the performance of iFOBT when used on patients presenting with uncharacteristic symptoms of CRC, and the clinical implications.

Materials and methods

We will develop a guideline for the use of iFOBT in general practice. The guideline is aimed at men and women aged 30 years and above who present symptoms that could origin from a CRC, but are not classified as alarm symptoms. The guideline will contain a list of symptoms for which it is recommended to perform iFOBT and suggested actions for positive and negative test result. A value of \<49µg/L will be considered 'negative' and \>50µg/L as 'positive'.

The study uses a cluster randomised stepped wedge design, and is executed in the Central Denmark Region. Municipalities of the region are randomised when to receive a CME, and are included sequentially in the study during the first seven month of the study period. The CME are arranged on scheduled GP-meetings in each municipality and will consist of a 45 minutes lecture on CRC diagnosis and use of iFOBT. Besides a CME, the intervention consist of a start package (10 iFOBT kits, a guideline and online educational material) that is sent to GPs when they are included in the study, and a status mail that GPs receive approx. one month after inclusion. The study period is one year. Data analysis will focus on the uptake and clinical use of iFOBT in general practice, the performance of iFOBT when used on patients presenting with uncharacteristic symptoms of CRC and the clinical implications.

Perspectives

This study will investigate iFOBT and explore its role in general practice. To our knowledge, this study will be one of the first and most thorough investigations of this test in a primary care setting. The results will bring important knowledge of how to improve the diagnostics of colorectal cancer in the future and hopefully reduce time to diagnosis. Especially for patients who do not meet the traditional Danish criteria for fast-track referral, this study will be a corner stone in the identification of more efficient ways to locate patients at risk of developing CRC. At both national and international level, this project will contribute with important knowledge that may provide better planning of CRC diagnostics in the future.","Inclusion Criteria:

King's College London,OTHER,NCT04610879,"Changing Agendas on Sleep, Treatment and Learning in Epilepsy","Randomised Factorial Design Controlled Trial Comparing Carbamazepine, Levetiracetam or Active Monitoring Combined With or Without Sleep Behaviour Intervention in Treatment Naive Children With Rolandic Epilepsy","Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common type of epilepsy. Children with RE have seizures and can often find that their learning, sleep, behaviour, self-esteem and mood are affected.

As part of standard NHS care, children diagnosed with RE may be treated with standard anti-epileptic medicines, like carbamazepine, or no medicine at all. The medicines used to treat epilepsy often slow down a child's thinking and learning. In the past, doctors believed this was an acceptable price to pay to reduce seizures. However, with RE, where the seizures usually stop in teenage years, investigators do not know if it is better to treat these children with medicines or not, especially if the medicines might have a negative effect on their learning.

A newer medicine called levetiracetam has also been found to work in children with RE and has shown less problems with thinking and learning in adults. However, it is still no known if this is also the case for children and it has not been proven which of the three options (carbamazepine, levetiracetam or no treatment) would be best for RE patients. The CASTLE study aims to find this out.

In addition, it has been found that seizures often happen when a child has had poor sleep and they often come at night or early in the morning. It has been shown that sleep can be improved through practice without the need of medicines. There are established guidelines to help toddlers go to sleep, but nothing available that helps young people with epilepsy and their parents improve their sleep quality. In the CASTLE study, a sleep training plan has been developed for children with epilepsy and the trial aims to find out whether following this sleep training plan results in less seizures than using no sleep training at all.","The trial is a phase IV randomised factorial design controlled trial comparing carbamazepine, levetiracetam or active monitoring combined with or without sleep behaviour intervention. A factorial trial design has been used as this approach enables the efficient simultaneous investigation of AED (carbamazepine; levetiracetam; no AED) and sleep behaviour intervention (vs standard care) by including all participants in both analyses. In a factorial trial it is also possible to consider both the separate effects of each intervention and the benefits of receiving both interventions together (for example levetiracetam and sleep intervention).

The CASTLE trial will take place in NHS out-patient paediatric epilepsy and general paediatric clinics in the United Kingdom (UK).

Once consent has been obtained from the appropriate adult, and assent from the child if appropriate, by the delegated member of the research team the eligibility assessments will be completed, full eligibility confirmed (confirmation must be by a medically qualified doctor) and baseline data will be collected prior to randomisation.

Randomisation will be performed via a web based tool accessed by research team at site. This system is generated centrally by the Clinical Trial Research Centre (CTRC) using a computer algorithm concealed from the investigators and research teams/trial management group. In order to balance the groups, minimisation for variables believed to influence disease outcome and end points will be built into the randomisation algorithm.

Participants will be randomised to treatment with carbamazepine, levetiracetam or active monitoring. Where randomised to drug treatment, the randomised treatment should ideally begin on the day of randomisation or within 14 days of randomisation at the latest. Randomised treatment will continue for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 48 months. All treatments will be procured, prescribed and issued as per routine NHS practice.

Clinical data capture will be in the form of paper copies of Case Report Forms (CRFs) that will be returned as an on-going process from each centre to the CTRC. Patient/parent reported data will be collected directly on paper at each outpatient visit with the exception of CANTAB, which will be collected on iPads at the centre.

All trial documents (except raw Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) from NHS digital that will only be retained for 1 year) will be retained for 25 years from the End of Trial.

The cells should then make type VII collagen.

The process of inserting the correct type VII collagen gene into cells is called ""gene transfer."" The virus used is called a ""retrovirus."" The virus is made so that it only delivers the type VII collagen gene and it should not spread to other parts of the body. During the study we will check for growth of the virus.

The corrected cells will be transplanted back to the patient. The research project involves gene transfer into keratinocytes, which are the majority of the cells in the outer layer of skin. In this gene transfer trial we plan to biopsy some skin tissue, grow the cells in a skin cell culture (sterile dishes with special fluid that allows cells to grow and multiply) and then infect the cells with a virus that we have genetically engineered to insert the correct type VII collagen gene. The cells should then make type VII collagen. The process of inserting the correct type VII collagen gene into cells is called ""gene transfer."" The virus used is called a ""retrovirus."" The virus is made so that it only delivers the type VII collagen gene and it should not spread to other parts of the body. During the study we will check for growth of the virus. After cells have received gene transfer, we will grow the cells in culture into a sheet of cells that look like a plastic film. We plan to graft the sheet to wounds.

Assiut University,OTHER,NCT03820284,Association Between Helicobacter Pylori and Inflammatory Bowel Disease,Association Between Helicobacter Pylori and Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Introduction:

Helicobacter pylori has been linked to a variety of gastric and extra gastric diseases. Chronic infection with H. pylori causes histologically evident gastritis in all colonized individuals and is the predominant risk factor for gastric and duodenal ulcers as well as gastric adenocarcinoma. However, increasingly robust experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests that H. pylori may at the same time be beneficial to its carriers, as it efficiently prevents allergic disorders and chronic inflammatory conditions .

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic, nonspecific intestinal inflammation with an unexplained pathology and an alternating relapsing and remitting clinical progression. IBD is divided into two subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Most studies in the IBD field attribute its etiology to the complex interactions among immune dysfunction, genetic susceptibility of the host, and environmental risk factors.

Since the twenty-first century, improving hygienic conditions and socioeconomic status have reduced the H. pylori infection rate and this trend has concurrently been accompanied by an increased IBD incidence in most countries Numerous studies have reported a lower H. pylori infection rate in patients with CD and/or UC than in non-IBD control individuals. although a small number of studies showed no significant association .Recently, emerging epidemiologic studies and animal experiments revealed an inverse correlation between H. pylori infection and IBD onset, suggesting that H. pylori colonization exerts a special protective effect on autoimmune diseases

Baseline (T0) and cosyntropin-stimulated (T60) STC, SFC and SalivCort concentrations were measured","We prospectively and consecutively enrolled 75 patients suffering from a SAH (n=44) or a NSAH (n=31). Inclusion criteria were patients aged between 18 and 75 years with an acute hepatitis defined by an abrupt rise in serum aminotransaminase levels during the 15 previous days (AST or ALT greater than 500 IU/L or greater than 10 times the upper normal value); the acute hepatitis was considered as severe if the prothrombin index was lower than 50% and as non-severe if it was greater than 50%. We excluded patients with the following conditions: a history of hypothalamic-pituitary or adrenal disease, corticosteroids treatment within the previous 6 months, ketoconazole intake, oral candida infection, any visible bleeding in the oral cavity, liver transplanted patients, acute alcoholic hepatitis and night workers. Twenty-nine healthy controls (HC) were thereafter enrolled and similarly distributed with the SAH group on age, sex and estrogen pill intake, estrogen therapy being the most common cause for changes in CBG levels. HC were without any known illnesses and were not receiving any medications. To evaluate the range of the SFC concentrations, eight patients with a known AD caused by impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (n=5) and adrenal gland (n=3) and followed at the Endocrinology Department of Besancon were also studied.

STC, SFC and salivary cortisol concentrations were measured blindly before (T0 between 8am and 9am) and 60 minutes after (T60) an intravenous injection of 250 µg tetracosactrin (synacthenÒ, Sigma-Tau laboratory, France). Serum CBG, albumin and ACTH were also measured","Inclusion Criteria:

This study will determine whether rituximab is an effective treatment for adult and pediatric patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis.

Study hypotheses: 1) The time to improvement in Group A patients (receiving rituximab first) will occur significantly earlier than in Group B patients (receiving rituximab later). 2) The proportion of patients improved at Week 8 of the treatment phase will be significantly greater in Group A than in Group B.","Rituximab is a chimeric, murine-human, genetically engineered monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 (cluster of differentiation antigen 20) antigen found on the surface of B-lymphocytes and is known to deplete B cells when administered intravenously. It is approved to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Rituximab has been used for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and immune-mediated hematologic disorders. It has also been studied and used in small numbers of patients with myositis. This study will evaluate the efficacy of rituximab in treating refractory adult and pediatric patients with dermatomyositis and adult polymyositis.

A patient's participation in this study will last approximately 45 weeks. At screening, participants will have a physical exam, muscle strength assessment, an electrocardiogram, and blood and urine collection; they will also be asked to complete several questionnaires. All participants will receive 2 infusions of rituximab and 2 infusions of placebo. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group A will receive rituximab at Weeks 0 and 1 and placebo at Weeks 8 and 9. Group B will receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 1 and rituximab at Weeks 8 and 9. Each infusion will be given on an outpatient basis over a minimum of approximately 5 hours' time.

There will be a total of 14 study visits. All participants will visit the outpatient clinic at selected time points for muscle strength testing, a physical exam, disease activity measurements, and blood collection. During the study, participants will be monitored closely for improvement or worsening of their disease and for serious drug related side effects. Some participants will be asked if they are willing to undergo 2 muscle biopsy procedures, 1 prior to receiving study medication and 1 after receiving study medication, to determine the effects of rituximab on muscle tissue.

If a participant is unable to locate a near-by clinical center, the adult and pediatric centers at the National Institute of Health located in Bethesda, Maryland have funds available to assist with travel costs.

NIH SUB-STUDY: ""Rituximab to Treat Dermatomyositis and Polymyositis""

The NIH sub-study will take advantage of the multi-center core RIM trial to identify changes in gene expression patterns in muscle, skin, and peripheral blood and the imaging features and immunopathology of muscle, skin, and peripheral cells before (week 0) and after (week 16) therapy. These changes will also be correlated with the large number of clinical, laboratory, and research variables already planned to be collected in the core RIM Study. Furthermore, knowing specifically which gene expression patterns are altered in resistant patients before rituximab, and which are changed after rituximab therapy - in conjunction with flow cytometry of peripheral cells and immunopathology of the tissues - will help in understanding more about the pathogenesis of myositis and the possible contribution of B lymphocytes and their subsets.

Patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the core RIM trial may be eligible for this sub-study. The following procedures will be conducted in addition to the core RIM trial procedures during the 13 clinic visits over a period of 44 weeks:

A subnormal response to circulating insulin levels at target tissues leads to a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Insulin resistance is associated with normal to high insulin levels and is often accompanied by dyslipidemia, a disruption in lipid metabolism resulting in increased triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein levels as well as decreased high-density lipoprotein levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the early stages of insulin resistance, a compensatory mechanism of increased insulin secretion by the pancreas maintains normal to near-normal glucose levels. Once the pancreas fails to maintain the increased insulin output, overt type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs.

TAK-559 is a novel oxyiminoalkanoic acid under investigation for use as an oral agent in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. TAK-559 has partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist activity, potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activity, and modest peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activity at high concentrations in nonclinical models.

This varies in form and intensity based on when and where it occurs and what vaccine is involved. Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently available. As the world is beginning the roll-out the first approved vaccines, little is known about people's potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine in most of the African countries. ACHES (African COVID -19Vaccine Hesitancy) is an observational study aimed at measuring COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in five west African countries and exploring causes behind the hesitancy with the main objective of informing guidelines for the proficient roll-out of the vaccines in the region.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. Although African countries seem to have weathered the pandemic relatively well so far, with fewer than one confirmed case for every thousand people and around 50,000 death, the African continent has now officially over two million- COVID-19- case threshold.

In 2015, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization defined vaccine hesitancy as a 'delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services', which can vary in form and intensity based on when and where it occurs and what vaccine is involved. Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently in development. As the world is beginning the roll-out the first approved vaccines, little is known about people's potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine in most of the African countries. A recent study published in Nature provides results on the acceptability of vaccines in 19 of the 35 hardest hit countries worldwide. South Africa was the only African country included in the survey. An additional survey conducted in 15 African countries between August and December 2020, reveals that the majority of Africans would take a safe and effective vaccine. Nevertheless, vaccine hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines evolves over-time. In this view, it is crucial to investigate in depth barriers and facilitators influencing vaccine hesitancy/acceptability within African population.

During the last decade several initiatives have emerged that aim at improving vaccine coverage and acceptability across the African continent. A noteworthy example is the Francophone African Civil Society Organizations' Platform for Strengthening Health Systems and Immunization, which has been since 2015 supported by GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation). OAFRESS encourages activities among francophone African members, with the primary objective of reinforcing capacities and coordinating strategies among these countries. The last West African Ebola epidemic demonstrated the importance of engaging communities in order to promote vaccine acceptability. The three most hit countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, worked together and invested in research and campaigns to identify and address barriers and facilitators of vaccine acceptance, which informed both clinical vaccine studies and roll-out strategies.

In order to promote the equitable and prompt roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, as the COVAX initiative strives for, factors influencing vaccine hesitancy in low and middle-income countries need to be investigated more thoroughly. The request for a first roll-out of the vaccines in eligible countries was to be submitted by December 7, 2020. Many of the eligible African countries have placed the order to receive the vaccines, which are already being deployed within these first months of 2021. Country and population preparedness are crucial to making the roll-out a success.

University of Nove de Julho,OTHER,NCT03591484,Treatment of Halitosis With Photodynamic Therapy in Older Patients,"Treatment of Halitosis With Photodynamic Therapy in Older Patients: Protocol for a Randomized, Controlled Trial","Halitosis is the term used to define an unpleasant odor emanating from the mouth. Some lung diseases, such as bronchiectasis, are among the extra-oral causes of this condition. However, no studies have evaluated the causes and treatment of halitosis in the population of older adults with bronchiectasis. Methods and analysis: A randomized, controlled trial is proposed. The patients will be divided into four groups: G1- healthy older adults with 10 teeth or more (n = 40); G2- healthy older adults who wear complete dentures (n = 40); G3- older adults with bronchiectasis and 10 teeth or more (n = 40); and G4- older adults with bronchiectasis who wear complete dentures (n = 40). Halitosis will be evaluated based on the measurement of volatile sulfur compounds using gas chromatography. The participants with halitosis will be randomized into two subgroups: treatment with photodynamic therapy (n = 20) or cleaning of the tongue with a tongue scraper (n = 20). After the treatments, a second evaluation will be performed, along with a microbiological analysis (qPCR) for the identification of the bacteria P. gingivalis and T. denticola. If the halitosis persists, the dentate participants will received periodontal treatment and the edentulous participants will be submitted to hygiene procedures for the mucosa and dentures. The evaluation of halitosis and the microbiological analysis will be repeated. If the halitosis is resolved, the participants will return after three months for an additional evaluation. This protocol will determine the effectiveness of phototherapy regarding the reduction of halitosis in healthy older adults and those with bronchiectasis.","Methods:

A single-center, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial was designed in accordance with the criteria recommended for interventional trials in the SPIRIT Statement. The project for the proposed study received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Nove de Julho (certificate number: 87160418.7.0000.5511).

Selection of individuals - characterization of sample - One group will be composed of older adults (60 years or older) with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis in medical follow up at the Pulmonary Disease Clinic of the School of Medicine of the Universidade de São Paulo. After verbal and written explanations of the study, those who agree to participate will sign a statement of informed consent approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Nove de Julho. The group of healthy patients will be composed of patients in treatment at the dental clinic of Universidade Nove de Julho, who will receive clarifications regarding the study and will also sign a statement of informed consent. The study will be conducted in compliance with the precepts stipulated in the Declaration of Helsinki (revised in Fortaleza, Brazil, 2013).

Calculation of sample size - To achieve an effect size of 0.40 among the four groups (PDT in healthy participants. PDT in patients with bronchiectasis, periodontal treatment or denture hygiene in healthy participants, periodontal treatment or denture hygiene in patients with bronchiectasis), assuming an alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 0.80, the total sample will be 80 individuals (20 per group). The sample size calculation was performed using G\*Power (version 3.1.9.2) (Faul, 2007).

Inclusion criteria - Men and women aged 60 years or older, with or without a diagnosis of bronchiectasis, with more than 10 natural teeth or using complete upper and lower dentures.

Exclusion criteria - smokers or ex-smokers having quit less than five years ago, a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (which, although is a lung disease, has a genetic etiology) and hypersensitivity to the photosensitizing agent used in PDT.

Training and calibration of examiner - An examiner (gold standard) will perform training and calibration exercises to maximize the reproducibility of the measurements. For such, 10 individuals with halitosis will be evaluated using the Oral Chroma® device. These individuals will not participate in the main study. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be calculated for the determination of intra-examiner agreement (≥ 0.90) with regard to the halitosis readings.

Randomization - The 40 healthy dentate individuals will be randomized in two groups: Group A (20 individuals submitted to treatment with a tongue scraper) and Group B (20 individuals submitted to treatment with PDT). The 40 healthy edentulous individuals will be randomized in two groups: Group C (20 individuals submitted to treatment with a tongue scraper) and Group D (20 individuals submitted to treatment with PDT). Therefore, two independent randomizations will be performed for these distinct groups of individuals (dentate and edentulous). Opaque envelopes will be identified with sequential numbers (1 to 40) and will contain pieces of paper with the information of the corresponding experimental group (A or B and C or D). Block randomization will be performed in blocks of five patients (four blocks for both treatments; example of a block: AABAB). The envelopes will be sealed and kept in numerical order in a safe place until the time of the treatments. The randomization and preparation of the envelopes will be performed by a researcher who will not otherwise participate in the study. The same procedure will be performed for the patients with bronchiectasis. Randomization will be performed using Microsoft Excel, version 2013.

Characterization of the study - The experimental design will consist of four groups: G1- healthy older adults with halitosis and 10 teeth or more (n = 40); G2- healthy older adults with halitosis who wear complete dentures (n = 40); G3- older adults with bronchiectasis who have halitosis and 10 teeth or more (n = 40); and G4- older adults with bronchiectasis who have halitosis and wear complete dentures (n = 40).

Some lung diseases, such as bronchiectasis, are among the extra-oral causes of this condition. However, no studies have evaluated the causes and treatment of halitosis in the population of older adults with bronchiectasis. Methods and analysis: A randomized, controlled trial is proposed. The patients will be divided into four groups: G1- healthy older adults with 10 teeth or more (n = 40); G2- healthy older adults who wear complete dentures (n = 40); G3- older adults with bronchiectasis and 10 teeth or more (n = 40); and G4- older adults with bronchiectasis who wear complete dentures (n = 40). Halitosis will be evaluated based on the measurement of volatile sulfur compounds using gas chromatography. The participants with halitosis will be randomized into two subgroups: treatment with photodynamic therapy (n = 20) or cleaning of the tongue with a tongue scraper (n = 20). After the treatments, a second evaluation will be performed, along with a microbiological analysis (qPCR) for the identification of the bacteria P. gingivalis and T. denticola. If the halitosis persists, the dentate participants will received periodontal treatment and the edentulous participants will be submitted to hygiene procedures for the mucosa and dentures. The evaluation of halitosis and the microbiological analysis will be repeated. If the halitosis is resolved, the participants will return after three months for an additional evaluation. This protocol will determine the effectiveness of phototherapy regarding the reduction of halitosis in healthy older adults and those with bronchiectasis. Methods: A single-center, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial was designed in accordance with the criteria recommended for interventional trials in the SPIRIT Statement. The project for the proposed study received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Nove de Julho (certificate number: 87160418.7.0000.5511). Selection of individuals - characterization of sample - One group will be composed of older adults (60 years or older) with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis in medical follow up at the Pulmonary Disease Clinic of the School of Medicine of the Universidade de São Paulo. After verbal and written explanations of the study, those who agree to participate will sign a statement of informed consent approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Nove de Julho. The group of healthy patients will be composed of patients in treatment at the dental clinic of Universidade Nove de Julho, who will receive clarifications regarding the study and will also sign a statement of informed consent. The study will be conducted in compliance with the precepts stipulated in the Declaration of Helsinki (revised in Fortaleza, Brazil, 2013). Calculation of sample size - To achieve an effect size of 0.40 among the four groups (PDT in healthy participants. PDT in patients with bronchiectasis, periodontal treatment or denture hygiene in healthy participants, periodontal treatment or denture hygiene in patients with bronchiectasis), assuming an alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 0.80, the total sample will be 80 individuals (20 per group). The sample size calculation was performed using G\*Power (version 3.1.9.2) (Faul, 2007). Inclusion criteria - Men and women aged 60 years or older, with or without a diagnosis of bronchiectasis, with more than 10 natural teeth or using complete upper and lower dentures. Exclusion criteria - smokers or ex-smokers having quit less than five years ago, a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (which, although is a lung disease, has a genetic etiology) and hypersensitivity to the photosensitizing agent used in PDT. Training and calibration of examiner - An examiner (gold standard) will perform training and calibration exercises to maximize the reproducibility of the measurements. For such, 10 individuals with halitosis will be evaluated using the Oral Chroma® device. These individuals will not participate in the main study. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be calculated for the determination of intra-examiner agreement (≥ 0.90) with regard to the halitosis readings. Randomization - The 40 healthy dentate individuals will be randomized in two groups: Group A (20 individuals submitted to treatment with a tongue scraper) and Group B (20 individuals submitted to treatment with PDT). The 40 healthy edentulous individuals will be randomized in two groups: Group C (20 individuals submitted to treatment with a tongue scraper) and Group D (20 individuals submitted to treatment with PDT). Therefore, two independent randomizations will be performed for these distinct groups of individuals (dentate and edentulous). Opaque envelopes will be identified with sequential numbers (1 to 40) and will contain pieces of paper with the information of the corresponding experimental group (A or B and C or D). Block randomization will be performed in blocks of five patients (four blocks for both treatments; example of a block: AABAB). The envelopes will be sealed and kept in numerical order in a safe place until the time of the treatments. The randomization and preparation of the envelopes will be performed by a researcher who will not otherwise participate in the study. The same procedure will be performed for the patients with bronchiectasis. Randomization will be performed using Microsoft Excel, version 2013. Characterization of the study - The experimental design will consist of four groups: G1- healthy older adults with halitosis and 10 teeth or more (n = 40); G2- healthy older adults with halitosis who wear complete dentures (n = 40); G3- older adults with bronchiectasis who have halitosis and 10 teeth or more (n = 40); and G4- older adults with bronchiectasis who have halitosis and wear complete dentures (n = 40).

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the infectious germ most commonly associated with lactation mastitis. Twenty percent of the general population are carriers of Staphylococcus aureus, which means that they carry the infectious germ but do not become ill from it. It has been suggested that mothers who are carriers of S. aureus in their nostril may be at an increased risk of developing lactational mastitis, however; this has not been clinical proven.

We are studying the relationship between S. aureus carrier status of breastfeeding mothers and infants and the risk of developing lactational mastitis. Additionally, we are collecting questionnaire data in an attempt to better define factors predisposing women to lactation mastitis.","Lactation mastitis is an acute inflammation of the interlobular connective tissue within the mammary gland of a breastfeeding woman. It is a relatively common condition that causes pain and worry, and can lead to restriction in activity and increased risk of early weaning from breastfeeding. Staphylococcus aureus is the infectious agent most commonly implicated in lactation mastitis.

It is well established that the anterior nares are the primary reservoir of S. aureus in humans and that approximately 20% of healthy individuals are ""persistent carriers"" of the organism. Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus has been identified as a significant risk factor for the development of infection including surgical wound infections. It has been suggested that maternal and infant nasal carriage of S. aureus may be associated with an increased risk of breast infection during lactation.

We propose to prospectively study the relationship between the S. aureus carrier status of 500 healthy breastfeeding dyads and the rate of the subsequent development of lactational mastitis. Carrier status of mothers and infants will be determined through two nasal swabbings performed in the early post-partum period.

While troponin measurement is highly sensitive for myocardial necrosis it has several limitations that influence its clinical use. First, since the troponin test is reliable only after 4-6 hours from symptoms onset, it has only limited value in the assessment of patients presenting earlier. Second, several clinical situations, most commonly renal dysfunction, are associated with increased troponin level and therefore may decrease the specificity of the test. Third, since troponin rise indicates myocardial infarction it is not useful in the common situations where there is myocardial ischemia without necrosis.

The P53 is a tumor suppressing gene activated in different stressful situations including hypoxia. This activation is associated with accelerated transcription (up to 30-50 folds from baseline) of different genes that are involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and in stopping the cell cycle. A study on pregnant women demonstrated high levels of fetal mRNA of these genes in maternal circulation. This gene expression correlated with other signs of fetal stress associated with hypoxia.

Use of topical immunosuppressants has increased in recent years because the topical corticotherapy leads to ocular complications. The most used immunosuppressant is cyclosporine. Tacrolimus , another immunosuppressant, has been used in treatment of immune and inflammatory ocular diseases.This study describes a prospective controlled double-blinded randomized study of the clinical outcome of SS dry eyes patients treated with 0.03% tacrolimus eye drops. As secondary purposes, outcome of dry eye symptoms and any ocular symptoms of the eye drops were also questioned to the patients.","Aqueous deficiency dry eye is mainly caused by Sjogren syndrome (SS), an autoimmune, chronic, inflammatory and systemic disease which affects most commonly the lacrimal and salivary glands. The hyperreactivity of B lymphocytes causes lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, which induces production of antibodies against antigens of the acinar epithelium and ducts of the lacrimal exocrine gland . The ocular treatment is focused in increasing lubrification and decreasing inflammation with topical autologous serum, topical immunosuppressive agents and corticotherapy. Use of topical immunosuppressants has increased in recent years because the topical corticotherapy leads to ocular complications.

Among topical immunosuppressants the most used ones are tacrolimus, also known as FK506 and cyclosporine A (CsA). Their mechanism of action is similar, but FK 506 is described to be 10 to 100 times more potent than CsA. Tacrolimus is a macrolide with immunomodulatory action and becomes biologically active only when it binds to immunophilin and acts by inhibiting calcineurin, limiting transduction of the signal that carries information from the cell membrane to the nucleus, with the aim of stimulating interleukin (IL) - 2 synthesis, and inhibiting T and B lymphocyte activation . Generally, tacrolimus suppresses the immune response by inhibiting the release of other inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, interferon- ϒ, and tumor necrosis factor - α) .

The systemic and topical use of tacrolimus is already well established in ophthalmologic treatments of immune-mediated diseases , uveitis, graft-versus-host disease , corneal transplants and ocular pemphigoid .

Columbia University,OTHER,NCT00005479,"Diabetes, Lipoproteins and Accelerated Vascular Disease",Measures of Postprandial Lipoproteins Are Not Associated With Coronary Artery Disease in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,To better understand the excess cardiovascular disease associated with diabetes mellitus.,"BACKGROUND:

Diabetes mellitus is associated with a 2-4 fold increase in risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary artery disease, is the leading cause of death in diabetics. The study was a subproject within a program project grant, with Henry Ginsberg as principal investigator. The program project was part of an institute-initiated study on The Etiology of Excess Cardiovascular Disease in Diabetes Mellitus. The initiative originated after discussions between NHLBI and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (JDFI). The Request for Applications (RFA) was originally issued in October 1994 and resulted in the award of one grant The RFA was reissued in December 1995 and resulted in the awarding of five program project grants, the one under discussion among them.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study, subproject 3 within a program project grant, was entitled Atherogenic Triglyceride Rich Lipoproteins in Diabetes. The subproject examined the atherogenicity of hypertriglyceridemia in subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Subproject 3 tested hypotheses concerning the impact of the size and number of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) on risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in several human populations. A case-control study of diabetics with or without coronary artery disease determined if TGRL size and number differed between the groups. In this study, Whites, Blacks and Hispanics with documented coronary artery disease or with less than 50 percent coronary stenosis by angiography were recruited. The hypothesis was tested that increased apoB in small TGRL was associated with coronary artery disease. Fasting and postprandial blood samples were obtained for measurement of TGRL apoB level, TGRL TG:apoB ratio, the amount of apoB in apoE-rich TGRL, and retinyl palmitate clearance. Allelic differences in the apoB, apoE, LPL, and apoCIII genes were examined for effects on the size and number of TGRL: specific hypotheses were tested regarding the impact of these alleles.

TGRL size and number were also compared in diabetics with and without carotid atherosclerosis in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, in Sioux and Pima Indian tribes that differed in ASCVD rates, and in Blacks, Whites and Hispanics with a range of insulin levels and insulin resistance in the Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS). These studies served both to confirm findings in the case-control study and to provide the opportunity to investigate diverse populations. The collaboration with IRAS allowed determination of the effects of insulin resistance and insulin secretory capacity on TGRL size and number. Finally, experiments with cultured endothelial cells were performed to determine if small TGRL could cause endothelial dysfunction. PMI-1 and VCAM-1 were markers of TGRL effects. In the case-control study, plasma PMI and VCAM-1 were measured to examine their relationship to coronary artery disease and to TGRL size and number.

Dollars awarded were estimated based on the CRISP assignment of $173,249 dollars in FY 1996 for Subproject 3. This was approximately 25 percent of the total dollars awarded and was used to estimated committed dollars.","Inclusion criteria

Cairo University,OTHER,NCT06078579,Salivary and Serum Leptin Levels in Oral Lichen Planus Patients: A Case-control Study.,Salivary and Serum Leptin Levels in Oral Lichen Planus Patients: A Case-Control Study.,This study aims to evaluate the levels of leptin in both saliva and serum samples of patients diagnosed with oral lichen.,"Oral lichen planus is a frequently encountered chronic muco-cutaneous condition with a high prevalence rate. The condition can be classified as an autoimmune disorder.Although the exact cause of this condition is unknown, some potential risk factors should be taken into account, such as systemic disorders, psychogenic diseases, dental restorations, and certain medications.

The oral lesions exhibit a mostly bilateral pattern, often manifesting in the inner buccal mucosa. The condition can be classified into three distinct forms, namely the reticular form, atrophic form, and bullous-erosive form.

The condition is classified as a premalignant lesion due to its significant likelihood of undergoing malignant transformation. The disease is characterized by the presence of T-lymphocyte infiltration in the basal cell layer of the epithelium and the presence of cytoid bodies, which are distinct histopathologic markers.

Leptin, a hormone generated by adipocytes, is involved in immunological responses and contributes to the development of autoimmunity. The presence of dyslipidemia has been found to be associated with lipoprotein (LP) abnormalities. Consequently, this study was undertaken to assess the blood leptin levels and lipid profile in individuals with LP. Leptin, a polypeptide hormone, is produced and released by white adipose tissue.

Multiple research have substantiated an increase in leptin levels among persons exhibiting elevated body mass index (BMI) and a higher percentage of total body fat. Additionally, it is involved in the cellular immune response and facilitates the development of autoimmunity.

There is a proposition suggesting that leptin has a role in the promotion of cytokine generation and modulation of helper T cells, potentially implicating its involvement in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The available information about leptin status in dermatological illnesses other than psoriasis is currently sparse. It is plausible that it may have a significant role in the pathogenesis of lichen planus.

However, there is a lack of literature regarding the levels of leptin in LP. There is an association between dyslipidemia and LP. Numerous investigations have consistently demonstrated notable deviations in lipid profile levels between individuals with LP and those in normal, healthy control cohorts. These findings have led researchers to posit a correlation between chronic inflammation and dyslipidemia, hence heightening the susceptibility to cardiovascular illnesses.

The potential impact of leptin on the progression of LP is being investigated. The objective of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of blood leptin levels between individuals recently diagnosed with LP and a control group consisting of healthy individuals. Additionally, an assessment was conducted to examine the correlation between leptin levels, lipid profile, and the length of illness.","Inclusion Criteria:

In Bangladesh the prevalence of stunting among children \<5-years of age is high (36%) reaching 50% in slum areas. The pathogenesis of stunting is multifaceted, yet nutritional inadequacy and repeated infections are established risk factors of stunting.

A three-arm randomized controlled trial in Dhaka's slum area is proposed. The children will be recruited from vaccination clinics. Infants at risk of stunting (-1 SD length-for-age z-score, LAZ) aged around 5 months are eligible for the study. Eligible children will be randomized to receive: 1) nutrition education on dietary diversity; 2) a combination of similar education plus daily supplementation of homemade yogurt; 3) a 'usual care' (control) group.

Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as temoporfin, that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, cancer cells are killed. This may be a better way to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To demonstrate that intraoperative adjuvant regional photodynamic therapy with low-dose temoporfin is safe. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Initial assessment of efficacy (i.e., 2-year disease free survival). II. To investigate the relationship between signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) levels, measured light dose and the clinical outcome. III. Correlate the serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites (25-hydroxyvitarnin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) with the presence of lymph node (LN) metastasis at the time of surgical resection. IV. To measure temoporfin uptake in malignant and normal tissue. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of photodynamic therapy with temoporfin. Patients receive temoporfin intravenously (IV) over no less than 6 minutes and then undergo standard surgical resection with intraoperative photodynamic therapy (PDT).

Based on our review of the pertinent literature, there is substantial evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure to oxygen during storage results in oxidative damage to the red blood cells leading to decreased therapeutic potential. Therefore, removal of oxygen from red blood cell products prior to storage has potential to preserve the cells in a more physiologically relevant state.

Currently, Hemanext has focused on the design and development of a dual compartment bag system designated as the Hemanext Red Blood Cell Processing System. After standard processing of donated whole blood units into leukoreduced packed red blood cells (LR-RBCs) with the appropriate additive solutions, the LR-RBCs would then be placed in the oxygen reduction bag (ORB) which allows for the rapid diffusion of oxygen out of the blood, through a sterile, oxygen-permeable membrane, and into iron-based oxygen sorbents. After processing, the blood is transferred again from the ORB into the Hemanext storage bag (HSB) which will preserve the anaerobic state of the LR-RBC product for the duration of cold storage.

Hemanext has conducted preliminary storage tests to ascertain the effects of anaerobic storage on overall blood health in various storage solutions. The research team has focused primarily on percent hemolysis, which is mandated by the FDA to remain below 1% for the duration of storage, as well as ATP and 2,3-DPG levels.","In vitro and in vivo performance of O2/CO2 reduced red blood cells produced with the Hemanext System will be used to demonstrate the acceptability the final product for clearance. To accomplish this, the study will require a total of 100 studyevaluable donors. completing the study. The study entails a randomized, paired, 2-x-2 crossover design where every study donor (n = 10093) evaluable study donors who completes the study will donate a total of two whole blood units with individual units being donated at least 56 days (8 weeks) apart. One unit will be used as the test and the other unit will be used for the control. The order in which the IP and the CP will be used to collect, filter and store the whole blood and appropriate blood products (within the context of the crossover design) will be randomized.","Inclusion Criteria:

Currently, Hemanext has focused on the design and development of a dual compartment bag system designated as the Hemanext Red Blood Cell Processing System. After standard processing of donated whole blood units into leukoreduced packed red blood cells (LR-RBCs) with the appropriate additive solutions, the LR-RBCs would then be placed in the oxygen reduction bag (ORB) which allows for the rapid diffusion of oxygen out of the blood, through a sterile, oxygen-permeable membrane, and into iron-based oxygen sorbents. After processing, the blood is transferred again from the ORB into the Hemanext storage bag (HSB) which will preserve the anaerobic state of the LR-RBC product for the duration of cold storage. Hemanext has conducted preliminary storage tests to ascertain the effects of anaerobic storage on overall blood health in various storage solutions. The research team has focused primarily on percent hemolysis, which is mandated by the FDA to remain below 1% for the duration of storage, as well as ATP and 2,3-DPG levels. In vitro and in vivo performance of O2/CO2 reduced red blood cells produced with the Hemanext System will be used to demonstrate the acceptability the final product for clearance. To accomplish this, the study will require a total of 100 studyevaluable donors. completing the study. The study entails a randomized, paired, 2-x-2 crossover design where every study donor (n = 10093) evaluable study donors who completes the study will donate a total of two whole blood units with individual units being donated at least 56 days (8 weeks) apart. One unit will be used as the test and the other unit will be used for the control.

University College Dublin,OTHER,NCT02550379,Emotion Recognition Training for Young People,Emotion Recognition Training for Socially Anxious Adolescents: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"While it has been hypothesised that individuals who experience social anxiety are more likely to misread facial emotions as threatening or disapproving, researchers have proposed that the difficulty may lie in decoding ambiguous facial expressions rather than identifying emotions which are expressed with greater intensity. Emotion recognition (ER) training provides a promising new avenue of research which may be beneficial in altering emotion processing biases which maintain or increase symptoms of mental health disorders. This study will examine the effectiveness of ER training in a community-based sample of young people (15-18 years) who report high levels of social anxiety. The intervention aims to alter emotion processing biases through a training procedure designed to promote the perception of happiness over disgust in ambiguous facial expressions which we hypothesise will subsequently reduce symptoms of social anxiety.

The study design consists of two phases. During Phase 1 participants will complete a screening questionnaire. This questionnaire will include a measure of the affective, cognitive, and behavioural components of social anxiety in adolescence. Depending on their suitability (i.e. scoring above a cut-off on a standardised measure of social anxiety in Phase 1 of the study), participants may then be invited to take part in a 4-day computer-based emotion recognition training programme (Phase 2). The purpose of this phase is to see if ER training will help young people feel less worried or nervous in social situations by training them to interpret ambiguous facial expressions as expressing a positive emotion (happy rather than disgusted).

Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or placebo (inactive) group. Both groups will be asked to complete a 4-day programme involving one computer training session per day (each session takes approximately 20 minutes). Questionnaires will also be given to participants to complete before and after the intervention, along with a 2-week follow-up assessment. These will include questionnaires to measure social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fear of negative evaluation. Each questionnaire will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants will not know whether they have received the intervention or placebo training until after the intervention.","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is among the most prevalent mental disorders in adolescence, 10% of females and 5% of males are diagnosed with SAD in adolescence. SAD is characterised by marked fear or anxiety about social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. SAD is associated with social isolation, poor social skills, low self-esteem, and future comorbid mental disorders. Social anxiety typically develops during adolescence, thus there is a need to detect and treat it early prior to the development of a clinically-diagnosed SAD. Most early interventions for social anxiety have used Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which focuses on modifying explicit verbal cognitions. However, many adolescents do not have access to CBT and many finding it demanding.

Research suggests that individuals who have high levels of social anxiety are more likely to misread facial emotions as threatening or disapproving, and researchers have proposed that the difficulty may lie in decoding low intensity facial expressions rather than identifying facial emotions which are expressed with greater intensity. In social anxiety, a bias towards perceiving ambiguous facial expressions as negative may give rise to avoidant behaviour and maintain or increase symptoms; therefore, this emotion processing bias may be a powerful bias for researchers to target with the aim of developing interventions to reduce symptoms.

ER training provides a promising new line of research which may be beneficial in altering emotion processing biases which maintain or increase symptoms of mental health disorders. Research has shown that ER training may be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in analogue populations with high levels of depression and anger and aggressive behaviour in healthy adults and adolescent youth at high risk of criminal offending and delinquency.

Present Study:

This research tests the effectiveness of ER training in reducing social anxiety in adolescents. Given that the age of onset of social anxiety is adolescence, peaking in late teens, this research focuses on 15-18 year olds.

Aims \& Objectives:

To test the effectiveness of ER training in reducing social anxiety in adolescents. The intervention aims to alter emotion processing biases through a training procedure designed to promote the perception of happiness over disgust in ambiguous facial expressions which we hypothesise will subsequently reduce symptoms of social anxiety.

Central Research Questions:

Is ER training associated with:

I. An increase in the perception of positive (happy) over negative (disgust) emotions in faces displaying ambiguous emotional expressions? II. A decrease in negative evaluations? III. A decrease in social anxiety? IV. A decrease in other forms of anxiety and/or symptoms of depression?

PHASE 1: SCREENING FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY IN ADOLESCENTS Objective: To screen for sub-clinical levels of social anxiety in adolescents. School Sampling: Approximately 8 large second-level schools in Dublin will be randomly selected from the Department of Education and Skills 2012 published list of schools.

Power Analysis: Using G\*Power 3.1, the sample size was determined as 111 based on the following parameters: a medium effect size of 0.3, alpha of 0.05, power of 0.8, a repeated measures within-between interaction: 2 (Randomization) X 3 (Pre, Post, Follow-up).

Participants: Adolescents aged 15-18 years in second-level schools will be invited for the initial screening.

Procedure: Adolescents must return parental and informed consent forms. Participants will be screened using the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C). Participants scoring above the cut-off of ≥18 will be invited to participate in the intervention (Phase 2).

Approximately 440 second-level students across 8 schools will be invited to complete screening. With an approximate response rate of 50% (N=220), and using a cut-off of ≥18 120 will be identified (60 per condition).

PHASE 2: RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL Objective: To compare the effectiveness of ER to placebo training in reducing social anxiety.

Participants: Adolescents from Phase 1 screening above a cut-off of ≥18 will be invited to participate in the intervention and will be randomly assigned to ER/placebo training. On the basis of screening, the PI will ensure group equivalence across ER versus placebo groups on key variables (e.g., age, gender, social anxiety) in advance of randomization. Post randomization, independent variables will be checked to ensure they are balanced across groups so as not to contaminate outcomes of the study.

Procedure:

Participants in both ER and placebo training groups will receive 4 training sessions over 4 consecutive days. The intervention will be performed on a laptop during school and delivered in a quiet room with the researcher present. Pre-intervention data will be collected on day 1 prior to training, post-intervention data will be collected on day 4 following training, with a follow-up assessment at 2-weeks post-intervention.

Training Task:

Participants will complete training over 4 consecutive days in schools. Each session will include a computerised training programme comprised of three phases, baseline, training, and test,which will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. A follow-up assessment will be completed two weeks post-intervention. During the 2-week follow-up assessment participants will complete a final assessment of emotion sensitivity using the test phase of the emotion recognition task.

* Prototypical 'happy' and 'disgust' composite images generated from 40 individual faces (20 x male, 20 x female) showing a disgust facial expression, and the same 40 individuals showing a happy expression.
* Prototypical images used as endpoints to generate a linear morph sequence that consists of images that change incrementally from unambiguously 'happy' to unambiguous 'disgust', with emotionally ambiguous images in the middle. The proposed research will include a sequence with 15 equally spaced images for each gender (male and female) for use as experimental stimuli.
* Previous research by the University of Bristol has used stimuli portraying male faces only. The task stimuli for the current research will be matched to the participant's gender, i.e. female participants will complete a task which will include female face stimuli and male participants will complete a task which will include male face stimuli.
* Baseline and test phases will consist of 45 trials, in which each of the stimuli from the morph sequence will be presented to the participant three times. The task will require the participant to make a forced choice judgement as to whether each face is displaying a happy or disgust expression. Images will be presented one at a time, in random order, for 150 milliseconds. Stimuli will be preceded by a fixation cross, which will be presented for a random period ranging from 1500 to 2500 milliseconds. Subsequent to presentation, and to prevent processing of after images, a backward mask of noise will be presented for 250 milliseconds, followed by a prompt asking the participant to respond. This will remain on screen until the participant makes response (i.e., a judgement of 'happy' or 'disgust').
* Trials in the training phase will be similar to trials in the baseline and test phases with respect to inter-trial interval and stimuli presentation, but with the addition of feedback subsequent to the participant's response. In the placebo condition, feedback will be based on the participant's baseline balance point. That is, responses will be classified as 'correct' if the participant identified images below the original balance point image as 'disgust' and above it as 'happy', and otherwise are classified as 'incorrect'. Feedback will be a message saying 'Correct / Incorrect! That face was disgust/happy'. In the training condition, feedback will be again based on the participant's baseline balance point, but the 'correct' classification will be shifted two morph steps towards the 'disgust' end of the continuum, so that the two images nearest the balance point that the participant would previously have classified as 'disgust' at baseline will be considered 'happy' when providing feedback. In each training block, each face from the 15 face continuum will be presented twice. The order of presentation will be randomized within each block. Three training blocks will be given to each participant, resulting in 90 training trials per session and a total of 360 training trials in total.

Outcome Measures:

Outcome measure will be administered to all participants in the RCT pre-intervention (baseline on day 1), post-intervention (day 4), and at 2-week follow-up, including:

Emotion Sensitivity Measurement Accuracy assessed using baseline and test measurements at each ER/placebo training session.

Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C) The SPAI-C is a 26-item self-report instrument and has good psychometric properties with adolescent samples. The SPAI-C measures the somatic, cognitive, and behavioural aspects of social phobia in children and adolescents. Questions relate to how nervous the respondent feels when carrying out certain tasks and responses are rated on a 3-point scale from never, or hardly ever to most of the time, or always with higher scores indicating greater levels of social anxiety.

Brief Fear of Negative Evaluations Scale - Revised (BFNE-R) Negative evaluations are an important aspect of social anxiety. The BFNE-R is a 12-item measure which assesses fear of negative evaluation. Items are responded to on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4. The BFNE-R has shown high internal consistency and correlates well with the original BFNE.

Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) Child Version The SCARED is used to screen for signs of anxiety disorders. The 41-item measure is used to measure anxiety, including panic, separation anxiety, generalised anxiety, social avoidance, and school phobia. It has shown high reliability with adolescents. Items are rated on a 3-point Likert scale. Internal consistencies have been shown to be high with adolescent samples.

Depression Subscale of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) The RCADS is a 47-item self-report measure and has good psychometric properties with adolescent samples. The Depression Subscale contains 10 items. Items relating to the frequency with which depressive symptoms are experienced are rated on a 4-point Likert scale.

Facharztzentrum Sonneberg-Coburg uBAG,OTHER,NCT05440279,Effects of Telemedical Support on Therapeutic Results of CPAP Patients,Effects of an Early Combination of Automated Electronic and Telemedical Support on the Therapeutic Results of CPAP and APAP Patients and as a Supplement to (Tele-) Medical Care,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a type of sleep-related breathing disorders that is characterized by a sleep-related constriction (obstruction) of the upper airways. The treatment with continuous application of positive airway pressure (CPAP) via respiratory mask forms the therapeutical standard of OSA. The autoCPAP (automatic positive airway pressure: APAP) therapy is an additional treatment option for patients with more unstable conditions (e.g. due to sleep position) which is characterized by a dynamic adaption of the applied airway pressure according to patients therapeutical needs. Device usage time and therapy adherence are crucial for treatment success.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a digital patient support (DPS) tool, complementary to standard care on continuous and automatic positive airway pressure (CPAP, APAP) adherence and daytime sleepiness after 12 weeks in patients diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

All patients with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 30 per hour are prospectively included and randomized to receive standard care (SC) or standard care with personalized DPS via prisma APP prototype version (SC+DPS). In both arms, initiation of therapy and standardized therapy control after 12 weeks is carried out identically. Patients in the SC+DPS arm received additionally automated feedback on their therapy and motivational messages, as well as therapy recommendations.","Clinical Picture From the epidemiological view obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD). OSA is characterized by a sleep-related constriction (obstruction) of the upper airways that in adulthood is often caused by a neuromuscular related impairment of the pharyngeal tone. OSA is linked to many negative health consequences and is associated with a large number of comorbidities.

General treatment As a rule SRBD are treated with appropriate therapy devices that transmit positive airway pressure (PAP) via respiratory masks. In the case of the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) therapeutical standard is formed by application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP therapy devices provide a stable positive airway pressure during sleep to prevent the upper airway obstructions. The determination of the essential airway pressure that keeps airways open takes place within the therapy setting night in the sleep laboratory under polysomnographic monitoring. Patients with more unstable pressure needs, e.g. based on position shifts during the night, also qualify for an autoCPAP (APAP) therapy. APAP therapy devices adapt the applied airway pressure dynamically within defined ranges according to patients' therapeutical needs. Therapy success is essentially defined by average device usage time and patients' long-term therapy adherence which in term is affected by a broad variety of factors. The identification of these factors therefore lead to the development of different treatment strategies to improve patients' therapy adherence.

Usual therapeutical process Patients with suspected OSA are surveyed according to their symptomatology and receive a sleep medical examination under polygraphical or polysomnographical observation. During the sleep medical examination numerous cardiorespiratory and somnological signals are recorded and evaluated.

As far as the evaluation of the recorded signals leads to the diagnosis of OSA and no indications for another type of PAP therapy are present, the adjustment to CPAP or APAP therapy under polysomnographical observation takes place immediately after diagnosis.

Following this, patients receive an appropriate adjusted CPAP- or APAP therapy device and get introduced in it´s handling to continue therapy by themselves in their home environment.

As part of the nightly home therapy, patients are expected to use the device according to the physicians advice. During the home therapy phase, the device is recording specific data to subsequently allow to draw conclusions about the therapeutic process and the therapy quality. In case of difficulties with therapy and dependent on their causes, patients are admonished to contact the sleep laboratory (regarding general problems with therapy) or the provider (regarding problems with the respiratory mask or device settings).

After a period of about 12 weeks, patients again appear in person in the sleep laboratory as part of the general therapy control. During the therapy control, the home usage data recorded by the therapy device are printed in reportform and the interventions which were implemented between first therapy setting and the therapy control are evaluated.

Finally, the medicating physician evaluates the therapy success within a conversation with the patients. In case of an inadequate outcome, therapy settings may have to be optimized.

Rationale of the study Literature shows that the first days of home therapy are crucial for long-term therapy adherence and that telemetrical support through automatic feedback can have a positive effect on therapy adherence.

However, there is a lack of experience how the effect on therapy outcomes caused by more individualized, automatic feedbacks combined with an appropriate supply of information and motivation over a longer period can be assessed.

This study is intended to investigate if therapy outcomes of CPAP and APAP patients can be further improved by an early intervention in the form of a combination of telemetric and electronic support.

Description of the applied medical device The applied medical device are the CE certified medical devices prismaSOFT/ prismaSMART (Type WM090TD) made by Löwenstein Medical Techology GmbH und Co. KG Hamburg. The applied accessories (especially breathing tubes, masks, humidifier, modems) are CE certified, too.

Devices of the WM090TD type are pressure-controlled, non-invasive, non-lifesupporting therapy devices or treating sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs) using a mask. The devices are used on persons weighing 30 kg or more. CPAP mode can be used on persons aged 3 years upwards. The device may only be used on a physician's instructions. (auto)CPAP mode provides positive airway pressure for treating obstructive sleep apnea in patients who breathe spontaneously.

Devices of the WM090TD type are used in clinical facilities and in the domestic environment. In the domestic environment, the devices also ac-company the owner on trips away.

The application of the device as part of this study takes place according to it´s intended use and within it´s indication range.

Procedure and interventions

If an OSA was diagnosed, patients will be asked for study participation and get informed about the rationale of the study. In case of patients informed consent they will be randomized to one of two groups (Standard Care = control group vs. Standard Care + Digital Patient Support Tool = intervention group).

At baseline, all patients receive an education session with a respiratory therapist about OSA and its consequences, proper use and maintenance of the CPAP device and mask, and therapy and study expectations. All patients are provided with a fixed or auto CPAP device (prismaSMART/ prismaSOFT, Löwenstein Medical Technology GmbH \& Co. KG), a heated humidifier (prismaAQUA, Löwenstein Medical Technology GmbH \& Co. KG) if needed, and a fitting interface. The initiation of therapy with anamnesis, diagnosis night, titration night, education, etc., as well as standardized therapy control after 12 weeks is carried out identically in standard care (SC) and in standard care with personalized digital support via prototype of prisma APP (SC+DPS) group and according to clinical routine.

At the beginning and with completion of the study every participant is surveyed about his daytime sleepiness applying the standardized questionnaire ""Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)"".

With completion of the study, each patient furthermore assesses his satisfaction with the CPAP therapy in general and with focus on therapy instructions and support. For this purpose, they rate 8 questions on a scale of 0-4, with a 4 being the best rating (0: strongly disagree, 1: barely disagree, 2: partly agree, 3: mostly agree, 4: strongly agree).

The intervention (SC+DPS) group receives electronic therapy support in addition to standard care. The electronic therapy support consists of:

1. Emails to patients with personalized, automated feedback on their therapy (derived from device data received via modem or data entered by the patient via electronic questionnaire),
2. electronic questionnaires (web-based) on possible problems during therapy and subjective therapy success,
3. possibility to set personal adherence goals every week,
4. links to explanations and videos on therapy and the handling of therapy equipment and accessories,
5. provision of data for the trial center in the event of contact by the patient, as well as for routine therapy monitoring.","Inclusion Criteria:

The intervention group received eight weeks of online sessions, while the control group received routine care. Results showed significant improvements in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, self-care, treatment adherence, and healthy lifestyle behaviors in the intervention group compared to controls (p\<0.05). Findings suggest that mindfulness-supported education enhances hypertension management. Further studies with larger samples and long-term follow-up are recommended.","Considering that theory-based educational practices alone are not sufficient in the management of HT and that a multifaceted perspective must be developed, in addition to the education based on the ADL nursing model, the conscious awareness approach, which is effective in stress management with its easy integration into daily life, has also been included in this program. In this way, individuals can gain experience and reach self-awareness as a result of theory and skill-based training and feel more motivated to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors. Multicomponent interventions offer a more comprehensive approach by combining a variety of methods, such as mindfulness, exercise, and dietary changes, as well as educational programs. Such integrated interventions can positively impact both individuals' knowledge and lifestyle habits, providing more effective results in the management of HT and contributing to long-term health improvements.

In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of the training program, structured according to Roper, Logan and Tierney's ADL nursing model and supported by awareness, on self-care, treatment compliance and healthy lifestyle behaviors in individuals with HT. This research is the first randomized controlled study in which the effects of a training program that is suitable for our country's patient profile for HT self-management, shaped according to multidimensional and up-to-date guidelines, that can encourage participants to change behavior, are tested.

The intervention group received eight weeks of online sessions, while the control group received routine care. Results showed significant improvements in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, self-care, treatment adherence, and healthy lifestyle behaviors in the intervention group compared to controls (p\<0.05). Findings suggest that mindfulness-supported education enhances hypertension management. Further studies with larger samples and long-term follow-up are recommended. Considering that theory-based educational practices alone are not sufficient in the management of HT and that a multifaceted perspective must be developed, in addition to the education based on the ADL nursing model, the conscious awareness approach, which is effective in stress management with its easy integration into daily life, has also been included in this program. In this way, individuals can gain experience and reach self-awareness as a result of theory and skill-based training and feel more motivated to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors. Multicomponent interventions offer a more comprehensive approach by combining a variety of methods, such as mindfulness, exercise, and dietary changes, as well as educational programs. Such integrated interventions can positively impact both individuals' knowledge and lifestyle habits, providing more effective results in the management of HT and contributing to long-term health improvements. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of the training program, structured according to Roper, Logan and Tierney's ADL nursing model and supported by awareness, on self-care, treatment compliance and healthy lifestyle behaviors in individuals with HT. This research is the first randomized controlled study in which the effects of a training program that is suitable for our country's patient profile for HT self-management, shaped according to multidimensional and up-to-date guidelines, that can encourage participants to change behavior, are tested. It has the potential to provide unique contributions to the field with its potential to create infrastructure.
