"Sultan Abdulhamid Han Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey",OTHER,NCT04709484,Comparison of the Effectiveness of USG and Palpation Guidance Steroid Injection in Patients With Plantar Fasciitis,Comparison of the Effectiveness of USG and Palpation Guidance Steroid Injection in Patients With Plantar Fasciitis,"Plantar fasciitis, often described as overloading of the plantar fascia, is the most common cause of heel pain in adults. It is characterized by a sharp pain along the medial aspect of the heel, which is worse with the first step taken in the morning or at the beginning of an activity and decreases as the person warms up. The etiology of plantar fasciitis is multifactorial and not well understood. Poor biomechanics and changes in the structure of the foot can lead to repeated micro-trauma at the beginning of the plantar fascia, causing inflammation and degeneration. Plantar fasciitis is more common in sedentary individuals and athletes and those participating in running sports. Other risk factors associated with plantar fasciitis include reduced ankle dorsiflexion, increased body mass index (BMI), and work-related weight loss activities.

Current treatments for plantar fasciitis, such as plantar fascia stretching exercises, strapping, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), arch braces, and heel pads are mainly aimed at reducing inflammation. Corticosteroid injections are usually reserved for refractory plantar fasciitis after conservative noninvasive attempts have failed. It has been shown to effectively reduce heel pain in patients with plantar fasciitis. The strong anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids can speed up the process of pain relief.

In our study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of USG and palpation guidance blind steroid injection in patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis.","It is planned to enroll 60 (sixty) patients in the study.

Patients will be randomized into 2 groups according to the Random Number Generation. The first group will be the USG-guided steroid injection group, and the second group will be the palpation-guided steroid injection group.

Francesc Marti,OTHER,NCT04774484,High-Intensity Interval Training and Regulatory T Cells,Impact of High-Intensity Interval Training on Regulatory T Cells,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a small population of T cells compromising of 1% to 5% of the total T cells in the body but they are playing a fundamental role in the maintenance of the immune homeostasis. These cells modulate the immune system by suppressing the effector activity and thus preventing autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory processes. Treg cell numbers have shown to increase with physical activity, and this increment has been directly correlated with exercise intensity. These results suggest that the increased Treg frequency may contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise on disorders associated with autoimmune disease or chronic low-grade inflammation such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease or cancer.

The overall purpose of this study is to determine the influence High-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the frequency and quality of peripheral Treg cells.","Tregs have been studied in clinical practice for different therapeutic applications. In the past several years there has been a significant interest in the transplant community to develop tolerance in order to substantially decrease or even eliminate the need of immuno-suppressive regimens. A growing body of evidence recognizes the balance between graft-reactive effector cells and graft-protective suppressor Treg cells as the ultimate determinant of long-term allograft survival. As a result, there is a major interest in transplantation to enhance the suppressor immune response as an alternative or complementary approach to reach a clinical tolerogenic state and preserve graft function.

PSC 833 is a cyclosporine analogue which is purportedly non-nephrotoxic and non-immunosuppressive. It has been shown in in-vitro studies to enhance chemosensitivity as well as cyclosporine and to be far better at increasing intracellular drug accumulation than the concentrations of verapamil which are clinically achievable. The purpose of this study is to define the maximum tolerated dose in combination with vinblastine, and to determine how the drug affects the pharmacokinetics of vinblastine. PSC 833 will most likely reduce the clearance of vinblastine, as reported for the parent compound, cyclosporine. This effect will increase the area under the curve (AUC) of vinblastine, may increase toxicity, and requires that the escalation scheme for PSC 833 be a conservative one. Initially, a 120 hour infusion of vinblastine will be given alone. Then 8 days of PSC 833 will follow to allow monitoring of adverse effects of PSC 833 alone. This first cycle of vinblastine will be given in the absence of PSC 833; in second and subsequent cycles both agents will be combined. Escalation of the PSC 833 will continue until a target concentration is reached, or until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.

Minia University,OTHER,NCT05289479,Pre-heated Resin Composite Restoration,"Effect Of Repeated Pre-Heating Of Resin Composite Restoration On Its Clinical Performance And Post-Operative Dentin Hypersensitivity ""A Randomized Clinical Trial""",this study is conducted to evaluate the post-operative hypersensitivity and clinical performance of preheated resin composite with different number of pre-heating cycles in class II carious lesions compared to resin composite restorations without preheating using Modified US Public Health Service Clinical Criteria (USPHS).,"1. Scientific Background One of the main problems associated with composite resin restorations is poor adaptation and gap formation between the restorative material and the cavity walls, resulting in the micro-leakage of oral fluids and accumulation of fluids responsible for many problems such as postoperative hypersensitivity, marginal discoloration and recurrent caries.

   Despite of recent developments in dental restorative materials and techniques, postoperative sensitivity following the application of a posterior resin composite restoration is often reported by dentists, as a clinical problem.

   Pre-application warming of dental resin composite restorative materials, is considered one of the modern modifications for the application of resin composite, which reduces viscosity and increases flowability, that in turn secures superior adaptation to the prepared cavity walls.

   Resin composite warming appliances found in the market nowadays, offer multiple choices for preheating either in different temperatures or in the form of the cassettes which could be compatible with different supplied forms from different manufacturers ""capsules or syringes"". Multiple cycles of preheating for the used composite resin syringe can affect both marginal integrity and mechanical properties of the resin composite according to the number of cycles applied.

   Increasing the temperature of dental resin composite before application can aid in monomer mobility inside its matrix giving high quality of degree of conversion and more highly cross-linked polymeric network. This kind of change of the rheology of the resin composite can aid in decreasing the postoperative hyper-sensitivity.

   However, an intensive review of literature failed to disclose the effect of using resin composite preheated for multiple times with different temperatures on the post-operative hypersensitivity.
2. Statement of the problem Using the same resin composite syringe that previously preheated multiple times in different daily restorative cases, can adversely affect the properties and the performance of the applied resin composite.
3. Hypothesis The null hypothesis is that using resin composite previously preheated for different cycles will not be different in reducing postoperative hypersensitivity, marginal integrity and mechanical properties of the resin composite as without preheating.

Heidelberg University,OTHER,NCT02482402,Iloprost for Bridging to Heart Transplantation in PH,"Iloprost for Bridging to Heart Transplantation in Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension and Left Heart Failure A Randomized, Controlled, Double-blind, Parallel Group, Proof-of-concept Trial","Trial Rationale/ Justification To assess efficacy and safety of inhaled Iloprost in treatment naïve patients with left heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, who are on the waiting list for orthotopic heart transplantation. As patients often show increasing hemodynamic values while waiting for a donor organ, the transplantation becomes infeasible at the time of identification of an appropriate donor organ when reaching the exclusion limits. Therefore, there is a high need of improvement and stabilisation of the patients' hemodynamic values as PVR, PAP and TPG. In a retrospective, non-controlled study inhaled Iloprost has already shown a beneficial effect on the hemodynamics as reduction of PVR, TPG and CI (Schulz 2010). Treatment with inhaled Iloprost could stabilize the hemodynamics and prevent the patients from being classified as ineligible by the time an appropriate donor organ is identified.

However, the adverse event profile regarding frequency, time-dependency has to be further validated to show safety and tolerability of inhaled Iloprost in this indication.

All patients can be transferred to a long-term medically supervised observation period with inhaled Iloprost therapy.","Scientific Background In many patients with severe left heart failure (LHF) a chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH) occurs during follow-up leading to a remodeling of pulmonary arteries with an increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and transpulmonary gradient (TPG). According to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation and the German Standing Committee on Organ Transplantation, cardiac transplantation is contraindicated if values of PAP, PVR, and/or TPG are above 40 mmHg, 240 dyn x s x cm-5, and 15 mmHg, respectively. Even if the patients show only slightly elevated hemodynamic values at the time of application for transplantation, values most often reach the respective exclusion limits during the waiting period. Patients signed in for transplantation partially are not any longer electable for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) at the time of identification of an appropriate donor organ. In the meantime the time on the waiting list for heart transplantation is increasing. In 2001, patients being on the waiting list were undergoing heart transplantation within one year. In contrast, 972 patients were on the waiting list while only 325 heart transplantations were performed in Germany in 2011 (www.eurotransplant.nl).

At present, no specific therapy for PH due to left heart disease is available (Galie 2009), treatment with PAH agents is not recommended due to lack of data (Rosenkranz 2011).

There are only few studies with PH-targeted medication within this indication. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. Sildenafil), Endothelin-receptor antagonists and Prostacyclin are potential agents for the treatment of PH during the waiting period for a heart transplantation.

Iloprost is a synthetic analogue of Prostacyclin PGI2. Iloprost dilates systemic and pulmonary arterial vascular beds leading to a reduction of blood pressure.

In a previous study the investigators administered aerosolized Iloprost (ILO) in 14 patients with pulmonary hypertension due to chronic cardiac failure on the waiting list for heart transplantation. Iloprost caused a significant reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance without severe side effects and was more effective than nitric oxide (Sablotzky, Grünig et al. 2002, 2003). In a retrospective non-controlled study in 51 patients awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation Iloprost inhalation caused a significant decrease in PVR (from 458 dyn x s x cm-5 to 345 dyn x s x cm-5), a significant decrease in TPG (21 mmHg to 17 mmHg), and a significant improvement in Cardiac Index (CI) from 2,09 l/min/m2 to 2,23 l/min/m2 (Schulz et al., 2010). In a retrospective non-controlled study low-dose Bosentan improved hemodynamic parameters and 1-year survival rate in 82 end-stage heart failure patients on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation (Hefke et al., 2011).

Randomized-controlled trials are missing within this indication. Sildenafil is not a medication of first choice due to contraindications and as well as many patients waiting for OHT are treated with nitrate (medication due to coronary heart disease). In contrast, inhaled Iloprost has advantageous effects on coronary perfusion. However, in this indication the adverse event profile of inhaled Iloprost regarding frequency and time-dependency is not yet clear. In Germany inhaled Iloprost is administered by the I-Neb AAD-System which allows precise, reproducible dose of the drug.

Due to the positive results in retrospective analyses and in the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension, the initiation of this proof-of-concept study seems to be justified.","Inclusion Criteria:

In a retrospective non-controlled study in 51 patients awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation Iloprost inhalation caused a significant decrease in PVR (from 458 dyn x s x cm-5 to 345 dyn x s x cm-5), a significant decrease in TPG (21 mmHg to 17 mmHg), and a significant improvement in Cardiac Index (CI) from 2,09 l/min/m2 to 2,23 l/min/m2 (Schulz et al., 2010). In a retrospective non-controlled study low-dose Bosentan improved hemodynamic parameters and 1-year survival rate in 82 end-stage heart failure patients on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation (Hefke et al., 2011). Randomized-controlled trials are missing within this indication. Sildenafil is not a medication of first choice due to contraindications and as well as many patients waiting for OHT are treated with nitrate (medication due to coronary heart disease). In contrast, inhaled Iloprost has advantageous effects on coronary perfusion. However, in this indication the adverse event profile of inhaled Iloprost regarding frequency and time-dependency is not yet clear. In Germany inhaled Iloprost is administered by the I-Neb AAD-System which allows precise, reproducible dose of the drug. Due to the positive results in retrospective analyses and in the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension, the initiation of this proof-of-concept study seems to be justified.

* Compare the Endodrill instrument with conventional biopsy forceps in terms of ability to establish the correct diagnosis based on collected biopsies of tumors in the upper GI tract.
* Based on the quality of the collected tissue samples we want to evaluate which instrument generates the most useful material for genetic studies of the tumor.","Endodrill is a newly constructed biopsy tool for flexible endoscopic use. It uses a drilling motion within a casing to harvest solid biopsies from tissue through the biopsy channel of a conventional flexible endoscope. It was originally designed for sampling of tissue from submucosal lesions. The investigators´ first study of the instrument is now finished. Endodrill is safe to use and generates more submucosal tissue compared to biopsies with a conventional biopsy forceps.

In this study the investigators want to compare the Endodrill instrument´s ability to obtain representative tissue samples from tumors in the distal esophagus and cardia with a conventional biopsy forceps. In addition the investigators want to compare the tissue samples in terms of weight, quality, artefacts and whether either instrument is more suited for collecting tissue for genetic analysis. Such analysis will be conducted with Next-Generation Sequensing (NGS) of the whole exome, Whole Exome Sequensing (WES). In the event of positive results from these analysis the investigators will also conduct RNA-sequencing of the tumor tissue in order to start pre-operative mapping of genetic abnormalities.

20 patients will be enrolled for this study. For each patient the investigators will collect 10 biopsies, 5 biopsies each with conventional biopsy and the Endodrill instrument respectively. The order will be randomized for each patient. For each specific biopsy the investigator will choose a particular site on the suspected tumor tissue without knowing which instrument that will be used for the biopsy.

Diagnostics and Genetic Analysis Endodrill vs. Conventional Biopsy. Diagnostics and Genetic Analysis in Tumors of the Distal Esophagus and Cardia Endodrill is a new instrument for biopsy sampling in the GI-channel. The purposes of this study are as follows: * Compare the Endodrill instrument with conventional biopsy forceps in terms of ability to establish the correct diagnosis based on collected biopsies of tumors in the upper GI tract. * Based on the quality of the collected tissue samples we want to evaluate which instrument generates the most useful material for genetic studies of the tumor. Endodrill is a newly constructed biopsy tool for flexible endoscopic use. It uses a drilling motion within a casing to harvest solid biopsies from tissue through the biopsy channel of a conventional flexible endoscope. It was originally designed for sampling of tissue from submucosal lesions. The investigators´ first study of the instrument is now finished. Endodrill is safe to use and generates more submucosal tissue compared to biopsies with a conventional biopsy forceps. In this study the investigators want to compare the Endodrill instrument´s ability to obtain representative tissue samples from tumors in the distal esophagus and cardia with a conventional biopsy forceps. In addition the investigators want to compare the tissue samples in terms of weight, quality, artefacts and whether either instrument is more suited for collecting tissue for genetic analysis. Such analysis will be conducted with Next-Generation Sequensing (NGS) of the whole exome, Whole Exome Sequensing (WES). In the event of positive results from these analysis the investigators will also conduct RNA-sequencing of the tumor tissue in order to start pre-operative mapping of genetic abnormalities. 20 patients will be enrolled for this study. For each patient the investigators will collect 10 biopsies, 5 biopsies each with conventional biopsy and the Endodrill instrument respectively. The order will be randomized for each patient. For each specific biopsy the investigator will choose a particular site on the suspected tumor tissue without knowing which instrument that will be used for the biopsy. This procedure will be repeated for all 10 biopsies. Inclusion Criteria: * Patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus/cardia or stomach capable of stating a formal consent to participate in the study.

University Hospital Heidelberg,OTHER,NCT01568502,Dobutamine Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Versus Echocardiography for the Assessment of Outcome. Are the Two Imaging Modalities Comparable?,,"Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (DCMR) are both established non-invasive techniques, used in the clinical routine for the diagnostic classification and risk stratification of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD).

In this regard, regional wall motion abnormalities (WMA) during dobutamine stress, precede the development of ST-segment depression and anginal symptoms, enabling the detection of anatomically significant CAD and the assessment of clinical outcomes.

In a head-to-head comparison between the 2 techniques, favourable diagnostic characteristics in terms of higher sensitivity and accuracy were noted for DCMR compared to DSE.

Although it has been reported that stress induced WMA both in DCMR and in DSE are independent predictors for hard cardiac events such as cardiac death or myocardial infarction, the value of the 2 techniques for the risk stratification of patients with CAD has not been compared to each other so far.

Comparison of these 2 non-invasive techniques is important, because referring physicians need to know which modality is more reliable for the identification of patients at higher risk for subsequent cardiac events, who would benefit from early invasive therapy.

In the investigators study the investigators therefore sought to compare the ability of DSE versus DCMR to predict subsequent hard cardiac events and revascularization procedures in a patient cohort with high CAD prevalence. Their predictive value was compared to that of conventional atherogenic risk factors and to resting WMA. In addition, the investigators sought to determine if both techniques are equally suitable for structuring invasive or conservative treatment according to the presence or absence of inducible ischemia, respectively.","Background: Both DSE and DCMR are implemented in the daily diagnostic work-up of patients with ischemic heart disease. Although DCMR was previously shown to aid the diagnostic classification of patients with suspected CAD with higher sensitivity and accuracy compared to that provided by DSE, the value of the 2 techniques for the risk stratification of patients with CAD has not been investigated so far.

Methods: Patients with suspected or known CAD underwent either DSE or DCMR for clinical reasons using the same standardised high-dose dobutamine/atropine protocol. Patient matching was performed for age, gender and coronary risk factors. Wall motion was assessed at rest and during maximum stress, and outcome data including cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction (defined as hard cardiac events) and 'late' revascularization performed \>90 days after the MR-scans were prospectively collected at least 6 months after DSE or DCMR.

Follow-up Data: Personnel unaware of the stress testing results contacts each subject or an immediate family member and the date of this contact was used for calculating the follow-up time duration. Outcome data is collected from a standardized questionnaire and determined from patient interviews at the outpatient clinic or by telephone interviews. Reported clinical events are confirmed by review of the corresponding medical records in our electronic Hospital Information System (HIS), contact with the general practitioner, referring cardiologist or the treating hospital. Cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction are registered as major cardiac events. Cardiac death is defined as death from any cardiac cause (lethal arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure) or sudden unexpected death occurring without another explanation. Myocardial infarction is defined by angina of \>30 minutes duration and either ST segment elevation of ≥2mm in 2 consecutive ECG leads or a rise in troponin T of ≥0.03µg/l.

Other events include clinically indicated coronary arterial revascularization by percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).

Background: Both DSE and DCMR are implemented in the daily diagnostic work-up of patients with ischemic heart disease. Although DCMR was previously shown to aid the diagnostic classification of patients with suspected CAD with higher sensitivity and accuracy compared to that provided by DSE, the value of the 2 techniques for the risk stratification of patients with CAD has not been investigated so far. Methods: Patients with suspected or known CAD underwent either DSE or DCMR for clinical reasons using the same standardised high-dose dobutamine/atropine protocol. Patient matching was performed for age, gender and coronary risk factors. Wall motion was assessed at rest and during maximum stress, and outcome data including cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction (defined as hard cardiac events) and 'late' revascularization performed \>90 days after the MR-scans were prospectively collected at least 6 months after DSE or DCMR. Follow-up Data: Personnel unaware of the stress testing results contacts each subject or an immediate family member and the date of this contact was used for calculating the follow-up time duration. Outcome data is collected from a standardized questionnaire and determined from patient interviews at the outpatient clinic or by telephone interviews. Reported clinical events are confirmed by review of the corresponding medical records in our electronic Hospital Information System (HIS), contact with the general practitioner, referring cardiologist or the treating hospital. Cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction are registered as major cardiac events. Cardiac death is defined as death from any cardiac cause (lethal arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure) or sudden unexpected death occurring without another explanation. Myocardial infarction is defined by angina of \>30 minutes duration and either ST segment elevation of ≥2mm in 2 consecutive ECG leads or a rise in troponin T of ≥0.03µg/l. Other events include clinically indicated coronary arterial revascularization by percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). In case of 2 simultaneous cardiac events, the worst event was selected (cardiac death\>non-fatal myocardial infarction\>revascularization). Inclusion Criteria: * written informed consent before the DSE or DSCMR-examination Exclusion Criteria: * unstable angina * severe arterial hypertension (\>200/120mmHg) * moderate or severe valvular disease * general contraindications to dobutamine stress echocardiography:poor echogenic windows limiting endocardial border detection in ≥2 myocardial segments * general contraindications to dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic resonance: implanted pacemakers or cardioverter defibrillator, claustrophobia"
Bispebjerg Hospital,OTHER,NCT04100902,The Effect of Allergen Immunotherapy on Anti-viral Immunity in Patients With Allergic Asthma,"The Effect of Allergen Immunotherapy on Anti-viral Immunity in Patients With Allergic Asthma - A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial of HDM-AIT","Aim: To investigate the possible immune modulatory effects of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) on respiratory immunity in patients with allergic asthma (AA).

Background: Allergic sensitization to aeroallergens is a common co-morbidity in asthma that is associated with more frequent and severe asthma attacks. The investigators have recently shown that patients with allergic asthma also have an increased risk of pneumonia, and hence allergy in asthma may be associated with a relative respiratory immunodeficiency. However, the increased risk was obliterated in patients treated with AIT.

Methods: Patients with asthma sensitized to house-dust mite (HDM) is enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of HDM-AIT. Patients will be scheduled for 9 visits through 8 months including, randomization to 6 months of treatment with either HDM-AIT (Acarizax/Odactra) or placebo. Primary interferons (IFN) type I and III will be investigated in human bronchial epithelial cells as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes such as: Inflammatory cytokines, immunologic phenotype and immunohistochemistry will be investigated in bronchial biopsies, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum and HDM-patch biopsies as well as a thorough respiratory and allergic evaluation.

Expected outcomes: The investigators expect that, patients with AA have 1) decreased production of anti-viral type I and III IFN and that AIT increases these measures. 2) Anti-bacterial response is reduced through IL12, ß-defensin and IFN-γ and that AIT increases these measures. 3) Lastly, the investigators expect that T-cell response is dysregulated (Th1↓1/Th2↑) in patients with AA and that these findings are modulated in an immuno-protective direction after AIT.

Perspectives: This project will expand our understanding of the clinical significance of allergy in asthma in a completely novel direction and show how AIT may modulate the immune response to prevent infections.","1.1 Background Respiratory viral infections are the major cause of acute worsening of asthma. Importantly too, these infections may also predispose to bacterial infections. Patients with allergic asthma suffer from more frequent lower respiratory tract infections, more severe and longer lasting lower respiratory tract symptoms compared to healthy controls. Hence, the need to use antibiotics may reflect in part the increased susceptibility to viral infection in allergic asthma. The investigators have recently demonstrated that patients with allergic asthma have an increased risk of being prescribed antibiotics for respiratory infections compared to non-allergic patients with asthma. Other studies have identified allergic sensitization and respiratory viral infections as synergetic risk factors in asthma exacerbations. These findings suggest a possible link between the allergic sensitization, asthma and an impaired immune response against respiratory infections. Furthermore, the investigators have found that allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) reduces the risk of being prescribed antibiotics for respiratory infections in patients with allergic asthma. These novel observations make it of interest to investigate mechanistic pathways in target cells subjected to AIT.

In a recent study, investigating potential mechanisms involved in the interaction between allergen and viral infection the investigators found that house dust mite (HDM) impairs viral stimulus (TLR3)-induced type I and type III interferons in bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients and similarly in an in vivo mouse model of asthma exacerbation. This novel finding was accompanied with a direct effect of HDM on reducing TLR3 glycosylation. Hence, HDM exposure in patients with allergic asthma may also contribute to a defect antiviral response by interfering with components important for the anti-viral signalling such as TLR3. Furthermore, the investigators have observed that HDM has a capacity to induce over-expression of upstream Th2 cytokines such as IL-33, which may contribute to asthma exacerbations. In our studies HDM stands out amongst different allergens in causing both release of inflammatory inducing damage-associated metabolic patterns and impaired interferon response.

Inferentially, in this study the investigators will have the unique opportunity to examine effects of human in vivo HDM-AIT on the bronchial epithelial cell production of type I and type III interferons as well as the balance between Th1/and Th2 inflammation in response to viral and bacterial triggers. The investigators speculate that exposure to HDM-allergen may predispose to asthma exacerbations by causing dysregulation of the anti-viral interferon system as well as Th1/and Th2 inflammation and then that desensitization of patients with HDM-sensitive allergic asthma (AA) increases innate interferon response.

1.2 Hypothesis

1. Viral induced type I and type III IFN is increased in HBECS from patients with allergic asthma sensitized to HDM, after 24 weeks of Acarizax.
2. Viral induced type I and III IFN response is impaired in HBECs from patients with allergic asthma sensitized to HDM, before 24 weeks of Acarizax.

1.3 Investigational Medical Product (IMP): ACARIZAX Acarizax is sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) for the treatment of HDM allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergic asthma (AA). Acarizax is composed of standardized allergen extract from the HDMs' Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farina.

The efficacy of Acarizax has been tested in randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials as add-on treatment for the best maintenance treatment for AR and AA. The clinical effect of Acarizax has been demonstrated 8-14 weeks after initiation of treatment and data on clinical effect is available for up to 18 months of treatment. Acarizax was found to reduce time to first exacerbation (hazard-ratio 0.7) in patients with AA. Acarizax has been shown to reduce daily mean inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) by 81 microgram/day (95% CI: 27-136microgram/day). In AR, Acarizax has been shown to reduce Total Combined Rhinitis Score (TCRS). A meta-analysis on the efficacy of AIT on atopic dermatitis shows moderate level of efficacy. Hence, we will be studying the potential change in the immunologic phenotype as an exploratory outcome.

AIT has been known for more than 100 years as a potential curative and specific treatment for allergic diseases. The mechanism by which AIT works is poorly understood but a key target is likely modulation of immunopathology. Dysregulation of the immune system is thought to play an essential role in atopic diseases and is influenced by multiple complex regulatory mechanisms. Well-established immune modulatory effects of AIT are classified into following type of events:

Table 1. Mechanisms of AIT Order of events Events Change Time to initial change

1. Basophil- and Mast cell activity and degranulation of IgE mediated histamine release Decrease Immediately
2. Induction of allergen-specific Treg- and Breg cells and suppression of allergen specific Th1 and Th2 cells Increase Days to weeks
3. Specific IgE Early increase followed by chronic decrease to baseline Weeks to years
4. Specific IgG4 Continuously increase throughout treatment duration Weeks
5. Tissue resident eosinophils, basophils and mast cells and release of their mediators Decrease Months
6. Type 1 skin reactivity decrease Months

1.4 Rationale

Anti-viral immunity Interferons (IFNs) are essential cytokines in the anti-viral defence. IFN's are produced by many cell types in the lungs where human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the main producers. The major effects of IFNs include blocking of viral invasion into neighbour cells by cleaving viral nucleic acid and inhibiting viral replication and inducing apoptosis in affected cells. HBECs are critical for the development of a sufficient innate immune response to viral infection. Increasing evidence suggest that HBECS from patients with asthma and allergic asthma exhibit an impaired ability to secrete type I (IFN-beta), and III (IFN-lambda) interferons at viral infection. In addition, IFN-beta and IFN-lambda may inversely correlate with the level of Type 2 inflammation in the airway epithelium.

pDCs are essential effectors of the primary innate immune defence against viral infections, releasing large amounts of IFN-alpha, and driving Th1 polarisation of CD4 lymphocytes. However, pDCs also play an important role as antigen-presenting cells, by which they may drive a Th2 polarisation, increasing IgE-production in B-cells and potential cross-linking of FcepsilonR1-alpha receptors. Interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated that viral induced IFN-alpha release was diminished by activation of the FcepsilonR1-alpha receptor on the pDC by allergen exposure, suggesting a potential link between allergy and a reduced viral defence. In patients with allergic asthma viral induced IFN-alpha release was impaired in PBMC's indicating a more systemic impact in response to bronchial infection.

AIT: Mechanisms leading to suppression of allergic inflammation In general, it is acknowledged that Th2 / Treg cells tolerance is decisive for the development or suppression of allergic inflammation. Treg cells secrete high amounts of essential suppressor cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta. These cytokines contribute to the control of Th2 mediated allergic disease in various ways. Treg cells regulates B-cells by inducing a competitive IgG4 and IgA response resulting in suppression of IgE. Furthermore, Treg cells may suppress activation and degranulation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. Lastly Treg cells, suppress Th2 cells homing to tissue and epithelial cell activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Breg cells control excessive inflammatory responses through secretion of IL-10, supports differentiation of Treg cells and induces synthesis of IgG4. These effects may be involved in response to AIT and correlate with clinical improvement. Thus, AIT may result in a decrease of bronchial, nasal and conjunctival hyperreactivity, which is a reflection of decrease in underlying mucosal inflammation. Anti-IgE treatment ameliorates the seasonal variations in asthma exacerbations associated with virus infections, which may be related to an increase in the initial interferon response to viral infections. We thus speculate, that the potential immunomodulatory effects of AIT resulting in lowered risk of prescription antibiotics is the net result of alteration in allergen-induced mucosal Th-2 inflammation, mediated by an increase in primary IFN defence responses to viral infections.

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES 8.1 Sample size estimate Sample size calculations have been carried out using G-Power software (Behaviour Research Methods 2007 Faul et al).

8.1.1 Primary outcome:

To our knowledge there is no preceding studies investigation the relationship between AIT treatment and change in IFN-response in HBECS. The investigators have previously shown that treating human airway epithelium in vitro with azithromycin increase the IFN-response to viral infection mimics in a dose-dependent manner. Fold-change in INF-β was 1.55 (SD 0.555) at the given concentration. Given a significant change in IFN-β from week 0 to week 24 is set to be a 1.55-fold change with SD of 0.555, that alpha is set to 0.05, and the power to 0.80, in a two-sided test design, the calculation would look like this:

Mean (fold change in INF-β) group 1 (placebo): 1 Mean (fold change in INF-β) group 2 (Acarizax): 1.55 SD: 0.55 16 subjects will be needed in each study arm. Assuming a drop-out of 20%, a minimum of 40 subjects in total will need to be randomized.

8.2 Definitions of analysis sets 1) Populations for analysis:

1. Intention-to-treat population: All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of Acarizax or placebo. A comparison of the treatment groups will be performed.

2) Population for analysis based on adherence ≥ 80% to treatment.

1. Intention-to-treat population: All randomized subjects with adherence ≥ 80% to Acarizax therapy or placebo. A comparison of the treatment groups will be performed.

8.2.1 Efficacy analysis set Intention-to-treat population (as defined in 8.2).

8.2.2 Safety analysis set All patients who receive at least one dose of Acarizax/placebo.

8.3 Methods for statistical analyses All data limited to primary and key secondary outcomes will be analysed using SPSS v. 14 or later. all data are reported as median values with interquartile ranges and were analysed using non-parametric tests. Data within each group (Acarizax and placebo) will be analysed using linear mixed model or ANCOVA. Statistical differences between the Acarizax and placebo groups will be determined using the Mann - Whitney U test for unrelated samples. Skewed-data will be log-transformed before analysis and reported using median and 25/75 % percentiles. Parametric data will be analysed using the above-mentioned methods. Categorial data will be analysed using χ²-test. Statistical significance is defined as p\<0.05. The data from the subject dropping out will still be used in the analysis using methods for handling of missing data.

8.3.1 Analysis of the primary variable(s) The fold-change in IFN-β and IFN-λ are analysed before and after RV infection and/or poly(I:C) stimulation from V3 to V12 and will be compared between intervention and placebo treatment. The investigators expect parametric distribution of data.

The calculation will be as follows:

1. deltaIFN-β: IFN-β V12 - IFN-βV3
2. Mean fold-change IFN-β: Sum of individual changes / N

Supportive primary objectives are calculated between intervention and placebo treatment groups:

1. Change in expression of IFN-λ measured in ρg/ml (ELISA) and reported as fold change mean ± SD
2. Change in viral load/TCID50 assay measure reported as fold change mean ± SD

8.3.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s)

* Changes in IFN-responses will be analysed using same procedure as analysis of the primary outcome.
* Cytokines will be analysed accordingly to the method described in 8.3.1 and reported as ρm/ml (or similar quantitative method) and reported as fold change mean ± SEM
* Change in IFN-β/TSLP ratio and reported in %.
* The change, expressed as a ratio, in number of airway submucosal, muscle and epithelium mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, NK-cells, (MCT, MCTC and MCCPA3) per mm2 determined by microscopic evaluation of mucosa biopsies and epithelial brushings from V2 to V7.

8.3.3 Interim analysis No interim analysis is planned.

8.3.4 Use of database REDCap will be used for online CRF data management.

Acarizax is composed of standardized allergen extract from the HDMs' Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farina. The efficacy of Acarizax has been tested in randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials as add-on treatment for the best maintenance treatment for AR and AA. The clinical effect of Acarizax has been demonstrated 8-14 weeks after initiation of treatment and data on clinical effect is available for up to 18 months of treatment. Acarizax was found to reduce time to first exacerbation (hazard-ratio 0.7) in patients with AA. Acarizax has been shown to reduce daily mean inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) by 81 microgram/day (95% CI: 27-136microgram/day). In AR, Acarizax has been shown to reduce Total Combined Rhinitis Score (TCRS). A meta-analysis on the efficacy of AIT on atopic dermatitis shows moderate level of efficacy. Hence, we will be studying the potential change in the immunologic phenotype as an exploratory outcome. AIT has been known for more than 100 years as a potential curative and specific treatment for allergic diseases. The mechanism by which AIT works is poorly understood but a key target is likely modulation of immunopathology. Dysregulation of the immune system is thought to play an essential role in atopic diseases and is influenced by multiple complex regulatory mechanisms. Well-established immune modulatory effects of AIT are classified into following type of events: Table 1. Mechanisms of AIT Order of events Events Change Time to initial change 1. Basophil- and Mast cell activity and degranulation of IgE mediated histamine release Decrease Immediately 2. Induction of allergen-specific Treg- and Breg cells and suppression of allergen specific Th1 and Th2 cells Increase Days to weeks 3. Specific IgE Early increase followed by chronic decrease to baseline Weeks to years 4. Specific IgG4 Continuously increase throughout treatment duration Weeks 5. Tissue resident eosinophils, basophils and mast cells and release of their mediators Decrease Months 6. Type 1 skin reactivity decrease Months 1.4 Rationale Anti-viral immunity Interferons (IFNs) are essential cytokines in the anti-viral defence. IFN's are produced by many cell types in the lungs where human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the main producers. The major effects of IFNs include blocking of viral invasion into neighbour cells by cleaving viral nucleic acid and inhibiting viral replication and inducing apoptosis in affected cells. HBECs are critical for the development of a sufficient innate immune response to viral infection. Increasing evidence suggest that HBECS from patients with asthma and allergic asthma exhibit an impaired ability to secrete type I (IFN-beta), and III (IFN-lambda) interferons at viral infection. In addition, IFN-beta and IFN-lambda may inversely correlate with the level of Type 2 inflammation in the airway epithelium. pDCs are essential effectors of the primary innate immune defence against viral infections, releasing large amounts of IFN-alpha, and driving Th1 polarisation of CD4 lymphocytes. However, pDCs also play an important role as antigen-presenting cells, by which they may drive a Th2 polarisation, increasing IgE-production in B-cells and potential cross-linking of FcepsilonR1-alpha receptors. Interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated that viral induced IFN-alpha release was diminished by activation of the FcepsilonR1-alpha receptor on the pDC by allergen exposure, suggesting a potential link between allergy and a reduced viral defence. In patients with allergic asthma viral induced IFN-alpha release was impaired in PBMC's indicating a more systemic impact in response to bronchial infection. AIT: Mechanisms leading to suppression of allergic inflammation In general, it is acknowledged that Th2 / Treg cells tolerance is decisive for the development or suppression of allergic inflammation. Treg cells secrete high amounts of essential suppressor cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta. These cytokines contribute to the control of Th2 mediated allergic disease in various ways. Treg cells regulates B-cells by inducing a competitive IgG4 and IgA response resulting in suppression of IgE. Furthermore, Treg cells may suppress activation and degranulation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. Lastly Treg cells, suppress Th2 cells homing to tissue and epithelial cell activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Breg cells control excessive inflammatory responses through secretion of IL-10, supports differentiation of Treg cells and induces synthesis of IgG4. These effects may be involved in response to AIT and correlate with clinical improvement. Thus, AIT may result in a decrease of bronchial, nasal and conjunctival hyperreactivity, which is a reflection of decrease in underlying mucosal inflammation. Anti-IgE treatment ameliorates the seasonal variations in asthma exacerbations associated with virus infections, which may be related to an increase in the initial interferon response to viral infections. We thus speculate, that the potential immunomodulatory effects of AIT resulting in lowered risk of prescription antibiotics is the net result of alteration in allergen-induced mucosal Th-2 inflammation, mediated by an increase in primary IFN defence responses to viral infections. 6.6 Study governance and oversight 6.6.1 Study Site Bispebjerg Hospital, Dep. of Respiratory Medicine Bispebjerg Bakke 23, Entrance 66 DK - 2400 Copenhagen NV Denmark Phone: (+45) 35 31 35 69 Fax: (+45) 35 31 21 79 6.6.12 Additional sites of analyses * Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Copenhagen * Department of Respiratory Immunopharmacology University of Lund * ALK-Abelló A/S, Boege Allé 6-8, 2970 Hoersholm 6.6.13 Study registration and authorities Study code: VITAL EudraCT: 2019-003261-18 Ethics Committee journal number: H-19052148 Danish Medicines Agency: 2019-003261-18 ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT04100902 6.6.14 Steering Committee Christian Uggerhoej Woehlk, M.D., Ph.D.-student Asger Sverrild, M.D., Ph.D. Charlotte Menné Bonefeld, Professor Lena Uller Ass.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES 8.1 Sample size estimate Sample size calculations have been carried out using G-Power software (Behaviour Research Methods 2007 Faul et al). 8.1.1 Primary outcome: To our knowledge there is no preceding studies investigation the relationship between AIT treatment and change in IFN-response in HBECS. The investigators have previously shown that treating human airway epithelium in vitro with azithromycin increase the IFN-response to viral infection mimics in a dose-dependent manner. Fold-change in INF-β was 1.55 (SD 0.555) at the given concentration. Given a significant change in IFN-β from week 0 to week 24 is set to be a 1.55-fold change with SD of 0.555, that alpha is set to 0.05, and the power to 0.80, in a two-sided test design, the calculation would look like this: Mean (fold change in INF-β) group 1 (placebo): 1 Mean (fold change in INF-β) group 2 (Acarizax): 1.55 SD: 0.55 16 subjects will be needed in each study arm. Assuming a drop-out of 20%, a minimum of 40 subjects in total will need to be randomized. 8.2 Definitions of analysis sets 1) Populations for analysis: 1. Intention-to-treat population: All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of Acarizax or placebo. A comparison of the treatment groups will be performed. 2) Population for analysis based on adherence ≥ 80% to treatment. 1. Intention-to-treat population: All randomized subjects with adherence ≥ 80% to Acarizax therapy or placebo. A comparison of the treatment groups will be performed. 8.2.1 Efficacy analysis set Intention-to-treat population (as defined in 8.2). 8.2.2 Safety analysis set All patients who receive at least one dose of Acarizax/placebo. 8.3 Methods for statistical analyses All data limited to primary and key secondary outcomes will be analysed using SPSS v. 14 or later. all data are reported as median values with interquartile ranges and were analysed using non-parametric tests. Data within each group (Acarizax and placebo) will be analysed using linear mixed model or ANCOVA. Statistical differences between the Acarizax and placebo groups will be determined using the Mann - Whitney U test for unrelated samples. Skewed-data will be log-transformed before analysis and reported using median and 25/75 % percentiles. Parametric data will be analysed using the above-mentioned methods. Categorial data will be analysed using χ²-test. Statistical significance is defined as p\<0.05. The data from the subject dropping out will still be used in the analysis using methods for handling of missing data. 8.3.1 Analysis of the primary variable(s) The fold-change in IFN-β and IFN-λ are analysed before and after RV infection and/or poly(I:C) stimulation from V3 to V12 and will be compared between intervention and placebo treatment. The investigators expect parametric distribution of data. The calculation will be as follows: 1. deltaIFN-β: IFN-β V12 - IFN-βV3 2. Mean fold-change IFN-β: Sum of individual changes / N Supportive primary objectives are calculated between intervention and placebo treatment groups: 1. Change in expression of IFN-λ measured in ρg/ml (ELISA) and reported as fold change mean ± SD 2. Change in viral load/TCID50 assay measure reported as fold change mean ± SD 8.3.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s) * Changes in IFN-responses will be analysed using same procedure as analysis of the primary outcome. * Cytokines will be analysed accordingly to the method described in 8.3.1 and reported as ρm/ml (or similar quantitative method) and reported as fold change mean ± SEM * Change in IFN-β/TSLP ratio and reported in %. * The change, expressed as a ratio, in number of airway submucosal, muscle and epithelium mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, NK-cells, (MCT, MCTC and MCCPA3) per mm2 determined by microscopic evaluation of mucosa biopsies and epithelial brushings from V2 to V7. 8.3.3 Interim analysis No interim analysis is planned. 8.3.4 Use of database REDCap will be used for online CRF data management. 9.

Phase I This phase is aimed at compiling an extensive list of quality of life issues relevant for lung cancer patients. The following sources will be used: (1) existing questionnaires on lung cancer and respiratory illnesses, (2) the literature, (3) investigator's brochures (IB) on new drugs, and (4) interviews with health care professionals and patients.

Phase II Phase I data will provide information about the issues that should be included in an improved lung cancer module.

After this stage, the procedure will be formally peer-reviewed by the EORTC QLG Module Development Committee. After approval, the provisional list of items is ready for Phase III.

Phase III The provisional lung cancer module will be pre-tested in an international group of patients with lung cancer. Patients will be first asked to fill in the QLQ-C30 and the provisional revised lung cancer module. After completing the forms, patients will be interviewed with regard to the revised lung cancer module. The interview will identify questionnaire items that patients find annoying, confusing or upsetting. A further issue is relevance: patients should indicate whether there are issues they find irrelevant or whether issues not yet included in the provisional module need to be added.

Necmettin Erbakan University,OTHER,NCT05640284,Evaluation of the Effect of Periimplant Soft Tissue Phenotype on Marginal Bone Loss,Evaluation of the Effect of Periimplant Soft Tissue Phenotype on Marginal Bone Loss Using Biochemical Approach,"The goal of this clinical trial to test the effect of periimplant soft tissue phenotype in the participants with implant placed and at least 1 year after implant loading. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Is keratinized mucosal thickness (KMT) important in early marginal bone loss and peri implant health?
2. Is keratinized gingival width (KGW) important in early marginal bone loss and and peri implant health? The researchers plan to include 80 implants in the study. These 80 implants will be divided into 2 groups in 2 different ways according to their KMT and KGW on their buccal surfaces: KMT ≥2 mm are included in the adequate KMT, and those with KMT\<2 mm are in the insufficient KMT group. Those with KGW≥2 mm are adequate KGW, those with KGW\<2 mm are adequate KGW. The researchers will assess marginal bone loss around the implant using radiographs and collect peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) using paper strips. Another researchers will measure the Receptor Activator Of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B Ligand (RANKL), Osteoprotegerin (OPG), Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α), MicroRNA-223 (MiRNA-223), MicroRNA-27a (MiRNA-27a) levels in the collected PICF. They will compare radiographic bone loss and biomarker levels in groups.","Early marginal bone loss around the implant can be caused by various reasons. Keratinized mucosal thickness (KMT) and keratinized gingival width (KGW) are components of periimplant soft tissue. Recently, KGW and KMT in the peri-implant region have been investigated as possible factors influencing this phenomenon.

The hypothesis of this study: Periimplant soft tissue phenotype is associated with marginal bone loss and peri implant health through Receptor Activator Of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B Ligand (RANKL), Osteoprotegerin (OPG), Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α), MicroRNA-223 (MiRNA-223) and Microrna-27a 80 implants, at least 1 year after their loading, in patients who continued their routine controls will be included in the study. The participants in this study were selected from patients who underwent implant placement by the same periodontologist (E.Ö.) in the Department of Periodontology of Necmettin Erbakan University in 2020 and still have 6-month radiographic and clinical follow-up. Selected patients, those who signed the written informed consent form were included in the study. In the study, the first radiographs of all patients, the clinical and radiographic conditions obtained at the 6-month routine control examination will be evaluated. During the same routine controls, a sample of peri-implant groove fluid was taken with paper strips.

Diagnoses of the implants included in the study will be made using the criteria of the 2017 World Workshop on Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions. 2 mm marginal bone loss (MBL) which may occur during the bone remodeling process after implant placement and loading, is accepted as the threshold. The absence of signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, bleeding on probing) in the peri-implant soft tissue, probing depth (PD) ≤5 mm with mild force (approximately 0.25 N), and no further bone loss following initial healing are defined as ""periimplant health"". ""Peri-implant mucositis"" is defined as clinically observable signs of inflammation (swelling, redness and soft consistency of tissue), bleeding on probing (BOP) (lines or drops) and/or signs of suppuration in the absence of bone loss greater than 2 mm, the threshold for initial bone remodulation defined. The definition of ""peri-implantitis"" is clinically observable signs of inflammation, probing bleeding and/or suppuration, increased probing depth, progressive bone loss after implant restoration, or MBL ≥3 mm with profuse bleeding in the absence of initial radiographs and PD was ≥6 mm. Implants with periimplantitis will be excluded. Implants will be divided into 2 groups according to their peri-implant health: Peri-implant health and peri-implant mucositis.

In addition to routine clinical and radiographic examination of the implants, KMT and KGW measurements will be made. they will be divided into 2 groups in 2 ways. According to KMT on their buccal surfaces: KMT ≥2 mm are included in the adequate KMT, and those with KMT \<2 mm are in the inadequate KMT group (60). According to KGW on their buccal surfaces: KGW≥2 mm are adequate KGW, those with KGW\<2 mm are inadequate KGW.

Radiographic evaluation will be made using intraoral periapical radiographs obtained using the parallel technique with the plastic film holder. Calibration of digital images will be performed using the length of the implant as a well-defined fixed reference point. The bone level measurement will be made by measuring between the bone-implant first contact point and the reference point in the coronal part of the implant body selected for different implant systems in both the mesial and distal directions of the implants. In order to evaluate the marginal bone loss (MBL), the measurements obtained will be compared with the measurements on the radiographs taken after the delivery of the prosthesis.

Peri-implant crevicular fluid (PIGF) will be collected from the participants for the biochemical evaluation to be made. PIGF specimens will be collected from the mesiobuccal of each implant, prior to any periodontal probing, and after removal of the supra mucosal plate. The area to be sampled will be insulated with cotton rolls and air-dried. The paper will be advanced with the strip until it shows slight resistance and held in the sample area for 30 seconds. Samples will be stored at -70˚C.

TNF-α, RANKL, OPG and MiRNA 223 and MiRNA 27a evaluations of the peri-implant crevicular fluid (PIGF) collected from the patients will be performed. TNF-α, RANKL and OPG will be evaluated by the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) method. MiRNA 223 and MiRNA 27a evaluations will be performed using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).

According to KGW on their buccal surfaces: KGW≥2 mm are adequate KGW, those with KGW\<2 mm are inadequate KGW. Radiographic evaluation will be made using intraoral periapical radiographs obtained using the parallel technique with the plastic film holder. Calibration of digital images will be performed using the length of the implant as a well-defined fixed reference point. The bone level measurement will be made by measuring between the bone-implant first contact point and the reference point in the coronal part of the implant body selected for different implant systems in both the mesial and distal directions of the implants. In order to evaluate the marginal bone loss (MBL), the measurements obtained will be compared with the measurements on the radiographs taken after the delivery of the prosthesis. Peri-implant crevicular fluid (PIGF) will be collected from the participants for the biochemical evaluation to be made. PIGF specimens will be collected from the mesiobuccal of each implant, prior to any periodontal probing, and after removal of the supra mucosal plate. The area to be sampled will be insulated with cotton rolls and air-dried. The paper will be advanced with the strip until it shows slight resistance and held in the sample area for 30 seconds. Samples will be stored at -70˚C. TNF-α, RANKL, OPG and MiRNA 223 and MiRNA 27a evaluations of the peri-implant crevicular fluid (PIGF) collected from the patients will be performed. TNF-α, RANKL and OPG will be evaluated by the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) method. MiRNA 223 and MiRNA 27a evaluations will be performed using Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Marginal bone loss and biomarker levels will be compared between the groups.

The overall objective is to provide data to assess the feasibility of implementing a future randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of the PDDM on the management of non-specific LBP in a clinical setting and to explore the short-term effect of using the model on patient's clinical outcomes.","Background: Non-specific mechanical low back pain (LBP) is highly prevalent, recurrent and is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite increased efforts in improving care, the self-reported levels of disability in individuals with LBP have not improved in the last decade. In order to more effectively manage LBP through non-pharmacological approaches, evidence endorses the use of classification systems to support diagnosis and guide treatments.

The study will also evaluate the safety and efficacy of the RP2D in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic, locally advanced, or unresectable breast cancer. The study will be opened to accrual at the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) main campus and constituent satellite sites, Deerfield Beach and Plantation.

This phase I/II study will have a total of 50 enrolled patients, taking into account 10% drop-out in the phase II follow-up. The duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects in Phase I/II is 2 years. The estimated duration for the Investigators to complete this study (Phase I/II) is 4.5 to 5 years.

For the phase I portion, standard 3+3 dose escalation/de-escalation design will be applied. Approximately 15 to 21 patients will be needed to establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). For the phase II portion of the study, up to 35 patients will be treated at the RP2D (MTD) including 6 patients treated at RP2D in phase I. Patients may remain on treatment with the combination until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity.

Tumor assessments will be conducted every 6 weeks (±7 days) to week 18. Thereafter, these assessments will be done every 12 weeks (±7 days). These will shall occur regardless of dose delays or dose interruptions, until Investigator-assessed progressive disease (PD), or death, whichever occurs first. More frequent tumor assessments may be performed as clinically indicated, at the discretion of the treating Investigator.

For the phase II portion of the study - patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than PD will continue to have required tumor assessments completed until PD or the initiation of a new therapy. Once patients have progressed, they will be followed for survival approximately every 3 months for at least 3 years. Subsequent anti-cancer therapies will be documented until study completion.

Patients who are discontinued from study treatment will return for the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit approximately 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of study treatment.","Inclusion Criteria:

Kaiser Permanente,OTHER,NCT01489579,Telephone Counseling for Tobacco Cessation,"Evaluation of Brief, Structured, Telephone Counseling for Tobacco Cessation as Part of a Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Service","The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving more structured information to patients over the phone about quitting tobacco helps to increase the chance that they will try to quit. The results of this study will help provide direction in developing a more standard way of helping patients to quit.

Study Hypothesis:

Brief, structured, telephone tobacco cessation counseling delivered by clinical pharmacy specialists will significantly increase the percentage of self-reported tobacco cessation attempts compared to usual care among patients enrolled in a cardiovascular risk reduction program.","While physician-delivered care may have the greatest impact on tobacco abstinence rates, recent data indicate that other health care providers such as nurses and pharmacists improve tobacco abstinence rates more than self-help and/or no intervention.5 Thus, pharmacists continue to expand their clinical practice areas to include smoking cessation interventions. A meta-analysis of studies involving pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation services found quit rates at 6 to12 months follow-up ranged from 14% to16%.6 The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that pharmacists can successfully deliver tobacco-cessation interventions and the evidence strongly suggests they are effective in helping increase tobacco cessation rates. Proactive telephone counseling can be more effective at increasing tobacco abstinence rates than self-help or no intervention.5 Telephone counseling is an effective system to help increase tobacco abstinence rates for a variety of reasons. From the tobacco user's standpoint, there are no transportation inconveniences and fewer scheduling conflicts. In addition, receiving counseling in the privacy of one's own home provides treatment access to individuals who are less willing to seek out counseling. At Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), members with a history of CVD are enrolled in the Clinical Pharmacy Cardiac Risk Service (CPCRS). The CPCRS is a clinical pharmacy specialist-managed, physician-directed program which provides secondary prevention care to over 14,000 patients. Clinical care includes evaluating and treatment of major cardiovascular risk factors, including tobacco use, for members. Currently, CPCRS has no standard of care with regard to addressing tobacco use. Clinical pharmacy specialists working in CPCRS deliver tobacco cessation advice at their own discretion, through various methods. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether brief, structured, telephone tobacco cessation counseling delivered by a clinical pharmacy specialist increases the number of smoking cessation attempts compared to usual care.","Inclusion Criteria:

Patients who meet the following criteria will be eligible for the study:

* Enrolled in CPCRS at the time of counseling (12/11-02/12),
* Current tobacco user as noted in KP HealthConnect as of the date of the routine CPCRS evaluation and counseling. For study purposes, tobacco use includes any use of cigarettes, pipe, cigars, snuff, and chew.

The results of this study will help provide direction in developing a more standard way of helping patients to quit. Study Hypothesis: Brief, structured, telephone tobacco cessation counseling delivered by clinical pharmacy specialists will significantly increase the percentage of self-reported tobacco cessation attempts compared to usual care among patients enrolled in a cardiovascular risk reduction program. While physician-delivered care may have the greatest impact on tobacco abstinence rates, recent data indicate that other health care providers such as nurses and pharmacists improve tobacco abstinence rates more than self-help and/or no intervention.5 Thus, pharmacists continue to expand their clinical practice areas to include smoking cessation interventions. A meta-analysis of studies involving pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation services found quit rates at 6 to12 months follow-up ranged from 14% to16%.6 The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that pharmacists can successfully deliver tobacco-cessation interventions and the evidence strongly suggests they are effective in helping increase tobacco cessation rates. Proactive telephone counseling can be more effective at increasing tobacco abstinence rates than self-help or no intervention.5 Telephone counseling is an effective system to help increase tobacco abstinence rates for a variety of reasons. From the tobacco user's standpoint, there are no transportation inconveniences and fewer scheduling conflicts. In addition, receiving counseling in the privacy of one's own home provides treatment access to individuals who are less willing to seek out counseling. At Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), members with a history of CVD are enrolled in the Clinical Pharmacy Cardiac Risk Service (CPCRS). The CPCRS is a clinical pharmacy specialist-managed, physician-directed program which provides secondary prevention care to over 14,000 patients. Clinical care includes evaluating and treatment of major cardiovascular risk factors, including tobacco use, for members. Currently, CPCRS has no standard of care with regard to addressing tobacco use. Clinical pharmacy specialists working in CPCRS deliver tobacco cessation advice at their own discretion, through various methods. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether brief, structured, telephone tobacco cessation counseling delivered by a clinical pharmacy specialist increases the number of smoking cessation attempts compared to usual care. Inclusion Criteria: Patients who meet the following criteria will be eligible for the study: * Enrolled in CPCRS at the time of counseling (12/11-02/12), * Current tobacco user as noted in KP HealthConnect as of the date of the routine CPCRS evaluation and counseling.

Universität Duisburg-Essen,OTHER,NCT03781284,PET Combined With MRI for Monitoring Inflammatory Activity in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis,Positron Emission Tomography With 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Combined With MRI for Monitoring Inflammatory Activity in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis,"Colonoscopy is considered crucial for the diagnosis and quantification of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, there are several drawbacks related to the invasiveness, procedure-related discomfort, risk of bowel perforation (especially in the period of acute inflammation), and relatively poor patient acceptance. Most patients regard the necessary bowel cleansing as burdensome. Feasible, accurate and well accepted non-invasive diagnostic techniques are needed for the determination of inflammatory activity and optimal tailoring of therapy. Hybrid PET/MRI represents an innovative combination of two established, non-invasive diagnostic tools: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowing for anatomic-functional imaging of the abdomen at high soft tissue contrast and positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) a non-invasive tool to monitor glucose metabolism and allowing a detection and quantification of inflammatory processes. Since MRI has limited sensitivity in UC and may be hampered by retained stool, a combination with another imaging modality is very appealing. PET, on the other side provides functional information, yet with limited anatomical landmarks and is relatively unsusceptible to artifacts associated to retained stool. In combination, these modalities might provide a valid alternative for the non-invasive assessment of the inflammatory activity in UC patients without the need for bowel purgation. It will therefore have to be investigated whether fecal material does impede the diagnostic quality of the combination of FDG-PET and MRI. For this purpose, the investigators will include 50 patients with confirmed ulcerative colitis. Dependent on clinical activity of the inflammation, patients will be randomized to undergo PET/MRI enterography either with or without prior bowel purgation followed by a colonoscopy. Inflammatory activity in 7 bowel segments will be analyzed based on PET/MRI with and without bowel purgation with the results of colonoscopy as standard of reference.

Patient acceptance of PET/MRI with and without bowel purgation as well as colonoscopy will be compared. PET/MRI with and without bowel cleansing will be compared with regard to diagnostic accuracy as well as for its patients' acceptance in comparison to colonoscopy.

The investigators hypothesize that PET/MRI will eventually be highly accurate to detect and monitor inflammatory activity in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Bayer,INDUSTRY,NCT06219902,A Study to Learn if Elinzanetant Affects the Ability to Drive and Brain Function in Healthy Women,"A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo- and Active-controlled, 4-period, Crossover Study to Investigate Effects of Elinzanetant on Simulated Driving Performance and Cognitive Function in Healthy Women","Researchers are looking for a better way to treat vasomotor symptoms (VMS), also known as hot flashes.

Hot flashes are intense and sudden feelings of heat along with sweating and reddening of the skin. These are common for women going through the menopause but can also occur in men. Such symptoms are called VMS and are caused by changes in sex hormone levels.

The study treatment, elinzanetant, is being tested for the treatment of VMS in both men and women. It works by blocking the activity of a substance called neurokinin, which is thought to play a role in starting hot flashes.

Elinzanetant may cause lasting effects like sleepiness and tiredness. Such effects may make driving unsafe.

The main purpose of this study is to learn how elinzanetant affects the ability to drive the next day in healthy women.

For this, researchers will study participants' ability to keep a stable position within their lane while driving on a straight road on a computer-based driving test (also known as a driving simulator).

In this study, participants will take 2 different doses of elinzanetant, another drug called zopiclone, and matching placebos to these drugs.

Zopiclone helps treat sleeping problems. A placebo looks like a study drug but does not have any medicine in it.

Participants will take elinzanetant, zopiclone, and their matching placebos by mouth.

This study will have 4 treatment periods with each period lasting 6 days. In each period, participants will receive one of the following treatments in an order assigned to them randomly (by chance):

* dose A of elinzanetant and a zopiclone placebo
* dose B of elinzanetant and a zopiclone placebo
* zopiclone 7.5 milligrams (mg) and elinzanetant placebo
* elinzanetant placebo and zopiclone placebo

Each participant will be in the study for around 15 weeks with up to 6 visits to the study site.

Participants will visit the study site:

* once before the treatment starts, so the study doctors and their team can check on their health and confirm if the participant can join the study
* once in each of the 4 treatment periods for a 6-day stay at the study site with a gap of 14 days between each period. During each stay, they will take the assigned treatment from Days 1 to 5 and the driving test on Days 2 and 6
* once, 2 to 3 days after their last treatment so the study doctors and their team can check on their health

During the study, the doctors and their study team will:

* check participants' health by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, and checking heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
* check the participants' ability to drive and their brain function and level of sleepiness using different tests including a driving simulator test
* check the level of the study drugs in participants' blood
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective of whether they think they are related to the study treatment or not.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

* Females aged 40 to 65 years, inclusive, at signing of informed consent.

Such symptoms are called VMS and are caused by changes in sex hormone levels. The study treatment, elinzanetant, is being tested for the treatment of VMS in both men and women. It works by blocking the activity of a substance called neurokinin, which is thought to play a role in starting hot flashes. Elinzanetant may cause lasting effects like sleepiness and tiredness. Such effects may make driving unsafe. The main purpose of this study is to learn how elinzanetant affects the ability to drive the next day in healthy women. For this, researchers will study participants' ability to keep a stable position within their lane while driving on a straight road on a computer-based driving test (also known as a driving simulator). In this study, participants will take 2 different doses of elinzanetant, another drug called zopiclone, and matching placebos to these drugs. Zopiclone helps treat sleeping problems. A placebo looks like a study drug but does not have any medicine in it. Participants will take elinzanetant, zopiclone, and their matching placebos by mouth. This study will have 4 treatment periods with each period lasting 6 days. In each period, participants will receive one of the following treatments in an order assigned to them randomly (by chance): * dose A of elinzanetant and a zopiclone placebo * dose B of elinzanetant and a zopiclone placebo * zopiclone 7.5 milligrams (mg) and elinzanetant placebo * elinzanetant placebo and zopiclone placebo Each participant will be in the study for around 15 weeks with up to 6 visits to the study site. Participants will visit the study site: * once before the treatment starts, so the study doctors and their team can check on their health and confirm if the participant can join the study * once in each of the 4 treatment periods for a 6-day stay at the study site with a gap of 14 days between each period. During each stay, they will take the assigned treatment from Days 1 to 5 and the driving test on Days 2 and 6 * once, 2 to 3 days after their last treatment so the study doctors and their team can check on their health During the study, the doctors and their study team will: * check participants' health by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, and checking heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG) * check the participants' ability to drive and their brain function and level of sleepiness using different tests including a driving simulator test * check the level of the study drugs in participants' blood * ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having. An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective of whether they think they are related to the study treatment or not. Inclusion Criteria: * Females aged 40 to 65 years, inclusive, at signing of informed consent. * Participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, blood pressure, pulse rate and electrocardiogram (ECG). * Participant has a regular sleep pattern, is not engaged in shift-work, and in general, has at least 7 hours of sleep each night (bedtime occurs between 21:00 and 24:00 hours). * Participant possesses a valid driver's license and is an active driver. Drives a minimum of 8,000 kilometers per year for the previous 3 years. Exclusion Criteria: * Relevant diseases within the last 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study intervention, including febrile illness. * A history within 2 years of, or current treatment for, a sleeping disorder (including excessive snoring, obstructive sleep apnea), or a chronic painful condition that interferes with the participant's sleep. * Abnormal finding in the physical examination, ECG, blood pressure, pulse rate or clinical laboratory results at Screening, that are considered clinically significant by the investigator. * Use of any medication of dietary supplement which may affect central nervous system (CNS) function and may confound the pharmacodynamic assessments of the study."

Study hypotheses: 1) The time to improvement in Group A patients (receiving rituximab first) will occur significantly earlier than in Group B patients (receiving rituximab later). 2) The proportion of patients improved at Week 8 of the treatment phase will be significantly greater in Group A than in Group B.","Rituximab is a chimeric, murine-human, genetically engineered monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 (cluster of differentiation antigen 20) antigen found on the surface of B-lymphocytes and is known to deplete B cells when administered intravenously. It is approved to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Rituximab has been used for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and immune-mediated hematologic disorders. It has also been studied and used in small numbers of patients with myositis. This study will evaluate the efficacy of rituximab in treating refractory adult and pediatric patients with dermatomyositis and adult polymyositis.

A patient's participation in this study will last approximately 45 weeks. At screening, participants will have a physical exam, muscle strength assessment, an electrocardiogram, and blood and urine collection; they will also be asked to complete several questionnaires. All participants will receive 2 infusions of rituximab and 2 infusions of placebo. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group A will receive rituximab at Weeks 0 and 1 and placebo at Weeks 8 and 9. Group B will receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 1 and rituximab at Weeks 8 and 9. Each infusion will be given on an outpatient basis over a minimum of approximately 5 hours' time.

There will be a total of 14 study visits. All participants will visit the outpatient clinic at selected time points for muscle strength testing, a physical exam, disease activity measurements, and blood collection. During the study, participants will be monitored closely for improvement or worsening of their disease and for serious drug related side effects. Some participants will be asked if they are willing to undergo 2 muscle biopsy procedures, 1 prior to receiving study medication and 1 after receiving study medication, to determine the effects of rituximab on muscle tissue.

If a participant is unable to locate a near-by clinical center, the adult and pediatric centers at the National Institute of Health located in Bethesda, Maryland have funds available to assist with travel costs.

NIH SUB-STUDY: ""Rituximab to Treat Dermatomyositis and Polymyositis""

* This study is currently recruiting patients.
* Sponsored by: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)
* Information provided by: National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC)
* Expected Total Enrollment: 30
* Study start: October 2006
* Location and Contact Information: Patient Recruitment and Public Liaison Office;(800) 411-1222; prpl@mail.cc.nih.gov; Phone: 1-866-411-1010

The NIH sub-study will take advantage of the multi-center core RIM trial to identify changes in gene expression patterns in muscle, skin, and peripheral blood and the imaging features and immunopathology of muscle, skin, and peripheral cells before (week 0) and after (week 16) therapy. These changes will also be correlated with the large number of clinical, laboratory, and research variables already planned to be collected in the core RIM Study. Furthermore, knowing specifically which gene expression patterns are altered in resistant patients before rituximab, and which are changed after rituximab therapy - in conjunction with flow cytometry of peripheral cells and immunopathology of the tissues - will help in understanding more about the pathogenesis of myositis and the possible contribution of B lymphocytes and their subsets.

Patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the core RIM trial may be eligible for this sub-study. The following procedures will be conducted in addition to the core RIM trial procedures during the 13 clinic visits over a period of 44 weeks:

* Weeks 0, 16: Muscle and skin biopsy (adult only). Small samples of muscle and skin tissue will be surgically removed for examination under a microscope.
* Weeks 0, 8, 16, 44: Skin evaluation and photography. The effect of the disease on the skin will be thoroughly evaluated and photographs of any rashes and of the skin around the nails will be taken.

University of Texas at Austin,OTHER,NCT04063384,Acute Alcohol Response In Bipolar Disorder: a fMRI Study,Subjective Response to Alcohol and Associated Neural Systems in Bipolar Disorder,"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect up to 60% of individuals with bipolar disorder during their lifetime-a rate 3 to 5 times higher than what occurs in the general population. The mechanisms that contribute to elevated rates of comorbidity are not known. Early identification in individuals with bipolar disorder who are at risk for AUDs could inform novel intervention strategies and improve life-long outcomes. The primary objective of this protocol is to use alcohol administration procedures and functional MRI techniques to investigate subjective response to alcohol, compared to placebo, and relationship with functional responses of, and connectivity among, brain regions in ventral prefrontal emotional networks in young adults with bipolar disorder and healthy comparison young adults. Baseline clinical and structural MRI assessments will be completed in 30 bipolar and 30 healthy young adults (21-26 years of age, 50% women). Then, following standard beverage administration procedures, participants will complete within-person, counter-balanced, fMRI scans and complete measures of subjective response to alcohol while under the influence of alcohol or placebo. Specifically, individual differences in the experience of stimulating, sedative, and anxiolytic effects of alcohol (measured with self-report surveys) and individual differences in neural responses to alcohol within ventral prefrontal emotional networks will be investigated and differences in bipolar disorder compared to healthy participants assessed. Functional MRI scans during a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral distractors (CPT-END) and at rest will be collected while under the influence of alcohol and placebo and compared. Experience of stimulating, sedative, and anxiolytic effects of alcohol from self-report survey data and neural responses to emotional stimuli while under the influence of alcohol compared to placebo will be the primary data outcomes assessed. Additionally, associations between subjective and neural response to alcohol and drinking patterns will be explored (secondary outcomes). The primary endpoint of the study will be after completion of both alcohol and placebo beverage conditions.","A total of 60 bipolar and healthy comparison subjects (n=30 per group, 21-26 years of age, 50% women, with no history of a moderate/severe AUD) will be recruited from the greater Austin area. Once recruited and enrolled, subjects will undergo detailed structured clinical evaluations to verify inclusion and exclusion criteria, comprehensive assessment of alcohol and other drug use history, and cognitive testing, followed by structural MRI assessments. Following standard beverage administration procedures, they will then complete measures of subjective response to alcohol and fMRI scans while under the influence of alcohol or a placebo condition (counter-balanced). For each participant the first beverage session assignment (whether the participant is given alcohol or the placebo beverage first) will be randomized. Alcohol and placebo sessions will occur within 3 days of each other. FMRI assessments will include a continuous performance task with emotional and neutral distractors (CPT-END) and a resting state scan.

For both the alcohol and the placebo beverage conditions, the protocol will be the same. The beverage administration sessions will occur in a private room at the University of Texas at Austin in the Imaging Research Center. The table in the testing room will be wiped down with alcohol prior to the participant's arrival (olfactory cue). Study staff will use an algorithm to calculate individual alcohol doses based on the participants' age, sex, height, and weight. Participants fast from food for 4 hours prior to their session. Before beginning consumption of their beverages, they will eat a weight-adjusted, 1 calorie per pound snack of pretzels. While participants eat their pretzels, study staff will mix beverages in front of participants. Vodka and placebo (decarbonated tonic water) will be stored in absolute vodka bottles, measured out, and combined with mixer in front of participants. Mixed drinks will be poured into glasses that have been sitting face down with rims soaking in vodka. Prior to giving the beverage to the participant, all drinks will get an alcohol floater (squirt of absolute vodka on top of the drink). Participants will be given 20 minutes to orally consume two beverages (10 minutes per beverage).

Following oral consumption and a 10 minute absorption period, breathalyzer tests will be conducted to identify a .06g% ascending limb breath alcohol concentration (BrAC). Self-report of subjective response to alcohol will be collected and participants will immediately enter the scanner and complete the fMRI scan (acquisition parameters are identical during alcohol and placebo conditions). BrAC will be tracked after the MRI scan and subjective response to alcohol collected again at peak BrAC and at descending BrAC of .06g%. Consistent with NIAAA guidelines for human alcohol studies, BrAC readings will continue every 30 minutes until participants are below 0.04% at which time they will be escorted home. During the placebo condition, participants will be given false BrAC readings. False BrAC readings given to participants during the placebo session will be based on the average BrACs we record during the alcohol sessions. The average time participants stay in the laboratory will be the same for the placebo and alcohol beverage conditions. Participants are debriefed after completing all sessions and the need for deception to ensure the placebo-controlled alcohol session will be explained.","Inclusion Criteria:

After treatment, participants will have follow-up visits every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for up to 5 years. After that, participants may be called or emailed.","Background:

* Of the several drugs and drug combinations approved for treatment of relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the reported complete response rates are no greater than 30%.
* Obinutuzumab is a glycoengineered, humanized type 2 anti-cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) monoclonal antibody thought to engage the immune system by directly activating antibody-dependent, cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); it is approved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in combination with chlorambucil.
* The key mediators of ADCC are polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells.
* Recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) is a stimulatory cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes, and long-term cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) + memory T-cells. In a Phase I trial, administration of rhIL-15 as a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion (civ) was associated with up to 45-fold increase in the number of NK cells at well tolerated dose levels.
* Preclinical murine lymphoid malignancy models have shown increased efficacy of monoclonal antibodies when administered together with recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15); BL/6 mice inoculated with EL4 murine T-cell lymphoma expressing human cluster of differentiation 20 (EL4-CD20) cells (a syngeneic lymphoma line); including significant prolongation of survival with the IL-15/Rituximab combination compared to either drug given as single agent (90% v. 30% alive at 75 days).

National Taiwan University Hospital,OTHER,NCT01042184,Efficacy of 10-day and 14-day Sequential Therapy Versus Triple Therapy on the Eradication of Helicobacter Pylori,Phase IV Study Comparing the Duration of Sequential Therapy,"Background: Helicobacter pylori infection has been shown to be associated with the development of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer diseases. Eradication of H. pylori infection could reduce the occurence or recurrence of these diseases. However, the eradication rate of clarithromycin-based triple therapy has been declining in recent years, probably related to the increasing resistant rate to clarithromycin. It was estimated that 15-20% of patients would fail from first line standard eradication therapy and need second line rescue therapy. About 15-30% of patient would fail from second line therapy and need to be rescued with third line therapy. In recent years, the concept of sequential therapy has been advocated in the treatment of H. pylori infection. The regimen includes a PPI plus amoxicillin for five days, followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin and tinidazole for another five days. The eradication rate in the first line treatment of sequential therapy had been reported to be as high as 90%. More importantly, it has been demonstrated that the eradication rate among patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains could be as high as 89%. However, tinidazole is not available in many countries. Whether metronidazole would be an effective alternative to tinidazole in the sequential therapy remains unknown. Besides, whether extending the duration of sequential therapy from 10-day to 14-day would result in higher eradication rate also deserves further investigation. Furthermore, data on the efficacy of rescue regimens for patients who failed from first line sequential therapy are also lacking. The impact of clarithromycin, metronidazole resistance and CYP2C19 polymorphism on the sequential therapy containing metronidazole (rather than tinidazole) also has not been reported.

Aims: Therefore, we aim to assess

1. whether the substitution of metronidazole for tinidazole in the sequential therapy is also more effective than clarithromycin-based triple therapy
2. whether extending the duration of sequential therapy from 10-day to 14-day would achieve higher eradication rate

Academisch Medisch Centrum - Universiteit van Amsterdam (AMC-UvA),OTHER,NCT01499979,Hypothermic Perfusion During Hemihepatectomy,In Situ Hypothermic Perfusion During Right Hemihepatectomy,"Rationale

Currently, hepatic resection is often the only curative treatment for primary or secondary hepatic malignancies and is also frequently performed in patients with benign liver tumors to prevent malignant transformation and/or alleviate symptoms. Liver resections are nowadays associated with low mortality and acceptable morbidity. As result of that, an increasing number of patients is currently under consideration for resection of more complex or large tumors, thus requiring extensive resection procedures. Application of vascular exclusion (i.e., clamping of the portal vein and hepatic artery) during such procedures reduces blood loss, which is one of the most important factors affecting peri-operative outcomes. However, vascular exclusion leads to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury as an inevitable side-effect, which adversely impacts postoperative liver function and regeneration. Additional cooling of the liver by means of hypothermic perfusion is expected to further reduce intraoperative blood loss, as well as to protect the liver from I/R injury. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to cool the future remnant liver (FRL) in situ during right hemihepatectomy under vascular exclusion. Consequently, an overall improvement in postoperative outcomes is expected due to a decrease in intraoperative blood loss, reduced parenchymal damage, and a better ability of the liver remnant to regenerate.

Objective

To reduce intraoperative blood loss and enhance tolerance of the FRL to I/R injury during right hemihepatectomy under vascular exclusion by means of in situ hypothermic perfusion with retrograde outflow (R-IHP) of the FRL.

Study design

The study is designed as a prospective randomized pilot study in 18 patients (9 interventions and 9 controls) to assess the effects of the proposed intervention. Additionally, 4 patients will be included separately for assessment of the intervention's feasibility prior to randomized inclusion.

Study population

Eligible patients for participation in this study are those planned to undergo right hemihepatectomy under vascular inflow occlusion because of a malignant or benign liver tumor, and who do not suffer from any hepatic co-morbidity that might influence postoperative outcomes (i.e., severe steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, or hepatitis B/C infection).

Polaris Health Directions,INDUSTRY,NCT02622984,Remote Brief Intervention and Referrals to Treatment Service for Alcohol,Remote Brief Intervention and Referrals to Treatment Service for Alcohol,"The traditional paradigm that relies upon training physicians and nurses or uses on-site interventionists to perform screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol has proven unsustainable in most clinical settings. The Remote Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (R-BIRT) for alcohol is an innovative telehealth service model with potential to improve public health through evidence based counseling for patients who exceed the NIAAA low risk drinking limits or have evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder with professional and self-help treatment. For those that are appropriate, the R-BIRT service will provide facilitated referrals to specialized alcohol abuse treatment. The service model is being studied in the emergency department (ED) setting to demonstrate its utility in a medical setting with a very high prevalence of risky alcohol use and Alcohol Use Disorders; however, the model is relevant and will be accessible to a broad array of healthcare settings, including primary care practices. Our new model, the R-BIRT, challenges the prevailing paradigm and offers the promise of not only clinical efficacy but increased cost effectiveness as well.","Significance: The USPHSTF, SAMHSA, CDC, and NIAAA have affirmed the importance of screening in medical settings for alcohol consumption that exceeds the NIAAA low risk limits, brief educational and motivational counseling for those who screen positive or have other evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder, and, when appropriate, referral to treatment (SBIRT). However, translation to clinical practice continues to be elusive. Polaris Health Directions (Small Business) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Research Institute) have partnered to solve this problem by creating the Remote Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment service for alcohol (R-BIRT), a telehealth service for delivering evidence based alcohol brief interventions and referral to treatment during a medical encounter in a cost-effective, sustainable way.

Investigators: The investigators have extensive expertise in SBIRT for alcohol (Boudreaux, Bernstein); telehealth (Boudreaux); development, testing, and marketing of behavioral intervention technologies (Boudreaux, Harralson); comparative effectiveness trial design and analysis (Barton); and health economics (Sachs). Combined, the team has over 100 publications related to SBIRT and constituent technology domains.

Innovation: This Phase 2 STTR will pioneer telehealth delivery of SBIRT for alcohol. It will be flexible enough for a variety of medical settings, and will develop and expand software capable of facilitating both telehealth and in-person SBIRT delivery models. It will further innovate SBIRT research and clinical practice by exploring mechanisms of action, an objective rarely incorporated into SBIRT studies.

Approach: The design is a two arm, single blind (outcomes assessor), randomized, non-inferiority trial. Emergency department (ED) patients (n=356) who drink above the NIAAA low risk limits or have evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder will be randomized to the telehealth model (R-BIRT) or a gold-standard in-person intervention (SBIRT) and followed for 6 months post-visit using a multi-method outcomes attainment plan. The study will establish the non-inferiority of the telehealth model compared to the in-person model in reducing alcohol use and alcohol related consequences, while showing that the telehealth model is the more cost effective of the two. Mechanisms of action, including patient knowledge of low risk drinking limits, motivation, self-efficacy, substance abuse treatment initiation, and self-help program engagement, will be examined.

Environment: With the success of the R-BIRT Phase 1 and other relevant projects, including previous large scale Phase 2 STTR clinical trials, Polaris and UMass have clearly established their capability of successfully carrying out this study, disseminating its results, and marketing the final product.

Impact: Because alcohol misuse, abuse, and dependence carries an enormous burden in both human suffering and healthcare costs, a strategy that provides high quality, evidence based care in a manner that is more cost effective and easier than existing models has potential to exert a substantial impact on public health.","Inclusion Criteria:

Carelon Research,OTHER,NCT00094302,Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy for Adults With Heart Failure and Preserved Systolic Function,Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT),"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of aldosterone antagonist therapy in reducing cardiovascular mortality, aborted cardiac arrest, and heart failure hospitalization in patients who have heart failure with preserved systolic function.","BACKGROUND:

Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in older people. Indeed, it is the most common discharge diagnosis in patients older than 65 years. As the United States population ages, heart failure will continue to grow as a public health concern. Therapeutic trials of heart failure have dealt almost exclusively with patients who have systolic dysfunction. However, there is now an emerging awareness that nearly half of the patients with heart failure have preserved systolic function and that the survival of these patients is adversely affected. This study is a randomized clinical trial of a novel therapeutic approach, specifically the use of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, in treating these patients. While this treatment has been shown to be useful in treating heart failure with reduced systolic function, it has not been studied in patients with preserved systolic function.

Patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function have a poor prognosis. The annual mortality rate is intermediate between the prognosis for those without heart failure and for those with heart failure and reduced systolic function. For instance, Family Health Study participants with heart failure and preserved systolic function had a mortality rate of 9% compared to 3% for their age- and gender-matched controls. The mortality rate was 19% in heart failure patients with reduced systolic function heart failure compared to 4% for their matched controls.

As heart failure develops, neurohormones are released that initially improve cardiac output but ultimately contribute to progression of left ventricular dysfunction. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is an important part of this compensatory response. Aldosterone levels may rise to 20 times normal levels in heart failure and aldosterone contributes to the development of myocardial fibrosis. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts on the distal tubule, inhibiting sodium and potassium ion exchange. There are several potential beneficial actions, including prevention of cardiac fibrosis. A recent trial evaluated spironolactone in patients with systolic dysfunction heart failure. Spironolactone treatment caused a 30% reduction in mortality compared to placebo (p\< 0.001). The improvement resulted from a reduction in all cause mortality. More recently, the Eplerenone Post-Myocardial Infarction (MI) study showed that this aldosterone antagonist significantly reduces mortality despite background treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker. Advantages of using spironolactone in this study are that it is commercially available, inexpensive, and no longer under patent (therefore this study will not be done by industry). Also, there is a clear physiologic rationale for its use, and the side effect profile is well understood. The study enrolled subjects who had preserved systolic function with heart failure and who met clearly defined eligibility criteria that were selected to make the results widely generalizable to clinical practice.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of aldosterone antagonist therapy (15 mg dose spironolactone or placebo; titrated up to 30 or 45 mg/day) in 3,445 adult patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function. Patients were recruited from August 2006 through January 2012, treated, and will be followed through June 2013. Approximately 270 clinical sites in six countries were subcontracted by the clinical trial coordinating center. Subject visits to a clinical center will occur every four or six months. Data collected include demographic and clinical data, including the results of history and physical exams, laboratory and imaging data, repository specimens for special physiology studies, and genetic studies. Additionally, data regarding quality of life and compliance with assigned treatment will also be collected and assessed.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

* Heart failure as defined by at least one of symptom (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea; orthopnea; or dyspnea on mild or moderate exertion) at the time of screening and at least one sign (any rales post cough; jugular venous pressure(JVP) greater than or equal to 10cm of water(H2O); lower extremity edema; or chest x-ray demonstrating pleural effusion, pulmonary congestion, or cardiomegaly) within 12 months prior to study entry:
* left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45% (per local reading); the ejection fraction must have been obtained within 6 months prior to randomization and after any MI or other event that would affect ejection fraction

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in older people. Indeed, it is the most common discharge diagnosis in patients older than 65 years. As the United States population ages, heart failure will continue to grow as a public health concern. Therapeutic trials of heart failure have dealt almost exclusively with patients who have systolic dysfunction. However, there is now an emerging awareness that nearly half of the patients with heart failure have preserved systolic function and that the survival of these patients is adversely affected. This study is a randomized clinical trial of a novel therapeutic approach, specifically the use of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, in treating these patients. While this treatment has been shown to be useful in treating heart failure with reduced systolic function, it has not been studied in patients with preserved systolic function. Patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function have a poor prognosis. The annual mortality rate is intermediate between the prognosis for those without heart failure and for those with heart failure and reduced systolic function. For instance, Family Health Study participants with heart failure and preserved systolic function had a mortality rate of 9% compared to 3% for their age- and gender-matched controls. The mortality rate was 19% in heart failure patients with reduced systolic function heart failure compared to 4% for their matched controls. As heart failure develops, neurohormones are released that initially improve cardiac output but ultimately contribute to progression of left ventricular dysfunction. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is an important part of this compensatory response. Aldosterone levels may rise to 20 times normal levels in heart failure and aldosterone contributes to the development of myocardial fibrosis. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts on the distal tubule, inhibiting sodium and potassium ion exchange. There are several potential beneficial actions, including prevention of cardiac fibrosis. A recent trial evaluated spironolactone in patients with systolic dysfunction heart failure. Spironolactone treatment caused a 30% reduction in mortality compared to placebo (p\< 0.001). The improvement resulted from a reduction in all cause mortality. More recently, the Eplerenone Post-Myocardial Infarction (MI) study showed that this aldosterone antagonist significantly reduces mortality despite background treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker. Advantages of using spironolactone in this study are that it is commercially available, inexpensive, and no longer under patent (therefore this study will not be done by industry). Also, there is a clear physiologic rationale for its use, and the side effect profile is well understood. The study enrolled subjects who had preserved systolic function with heart failure and who met clearly defined eligibility criteria that were selected to make the results widely generalizable to clinical practice. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of aldosterone antagonist therapy (15 mg dose spironolactone or placebo; titrated up to 30 or 45 mg/day) in 3,445 adult patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function. Patients were recruited from August 2006 through January 2012, treated, and will be followed through June 2013. Approximately 270 clinical sites in six countries were subcontracted by the clinical trial coordinating center. Subject visits to a clinical center will occur every four or six months. Data collected include demographic and clinical data, including the results of history and physical exams, laboratory and imaging data, repository specimens for special physiology studies, and genetic studies. Additionally, data regarding quality of life and compliance with assigned treatment will also be collected and assessed.

A retrospective cross-sectional study will be conducted to investigate the prevalence, severity and correlation between sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical and sleep quality related factors and OSA in children and adolescents diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG), using the criteria recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). The sample will consist of individuals who answered the questionnaires, performed the PSG at the Pelotas Sleep Institute and met the study inclusion criteria.","Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a severe condition among sleep respiratory disorders, characterized by intermittent episodes of partial (hypopnea) or total (apnea) obstruction of the upper airways during sleep. These obstructive episodes result in hypoxemia and hypercapnia, changes in intrathoracic pressure and sleep arousals, consequently leading sleep fragmentation and a non-restorative sleep pattern.

OSA affects 1 to 4% of the world's pediatric population, with a higher incidence between 2 to 8 years old, negatively affecting the general and oral health of children and adolescents. Studies show divergences regarding the prevalence among sexes, either showing similar rates for girls and boys, or a predilection of the disease for the male sex. Although scientific evidence reports known OSAs risk factors like adenotonsilar hypertrophy and obesity, there is still divergence of which associated characteristics are present in children and adolescents.

Diagnostic criteria of OSA in this population follows the recommendations of American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) through the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3), which determines full-night PSG as the gold standard test for the diagnosis and severity of OSA, as it promotes a quantitative and objective assessment of disturbances in breathing and sleep patterns. Although parents' report of child behavior and symptoms is essential for establishing the diagnosis of OSA, the factors evaluated in the anamnesis and clinical examination, in general, do not present adequate accuracy for the diagnosis of OSA. The use of clinical history and physical examination alone is not suitable for a definite diagnose of OSA when compared to PSG. Besides, most questionnaires used as alternative diagnostic methods do not meet the necessary criteria to be considered as acceptable tools in the identification of children and adolescents with OSA.

There is evidence in the literature regarding OSA's significant morbidity in children and adolescents, leading to cardiovascular, metabolic and neurocognitive complications, resulting in reduced quality of life. Also, OSA is associated with several craniofacial and dental changes, such as retrognathia, class II malocclusion, vertical face growth and sleep bruxism. It becomes clear the importance of the dentist in identifying factors associated with OSA in children and adolescents, this being the first step towards early and definitive diagnosis, followed by adequate treatment, to minimize the health damage in this population. Therefore, this study aims to study the risk factors correlated with OSA, the prevalence and severity of illness in children and adolescents, considering that the current scientific evidence is divergent.

A retrospective cross-sectional study will be conducted to investigate the prevalence, severity and associations between diagnosis by gold-standard PSG examination and the sociodemographic, clinical conditions, sleep quality and sleep structure of children and adolescents, following the recommended criteria by the AASM.

Screening blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were used to assure medical fitness to participate in the study. These measures were repeated during and after treatment with AB103 to monitor for adverse events (AEs). ECG and pulse oximetry was monitored continuously starting 15 minutes before the infusion and for 2 hours after each infusion. Vital signs (sitting blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry) and ECG measurements were recorded every 15 minutes for the first two hours starting from the beginning of the infusion and then approximately 24 hours later. Blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis, were repeated one day and one week after infusions. AEs either observed by the investigator or reported spontaneously by the subjects were recorded at each study visit. Subjects kept a 7-day diary starting on the day of infusion to record any AEs. The primary basis on which escalation was based was dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) defined as the emergence of one or more selected AEs that reached a threshold which justified stopping the trial. After safety monitoring committee review of safety data, progression to the next cohort was to occur as follows:

1. If none of the 5 AB103 subjects in a cohort experienced a non-extreme DLT, escalation to the next dose cohort was to occur.
2. If 1 of 5 subjects receiving AB103 in a cohort experienced a non-extreme DLT, then a total of 8 subjects (6 active: 2 placebo) were to be enrolled in that cohort before escalating to the next dose (escalation will only occur if no additional subjects (2 total) have a non-extreme DLT).
3. If there were 0/6 or 1/6 active subjects with a non-extreme DLT at the highest dose, the highest dose was to be considered the MTD. If there were 2/6 active subjects with a non-extreme DLT in a cohort, then the next lowest dose was to be considered the MTD.
4. If an extreme DLT occurred, the study was to be halted immediately.

Loay Abdulmutalib Almusawi,OTHER,NCT06371079,Safety and Suitability of ICL for Correction of Refractive Errors Without the Use of Dispersive OVDs,Safety and Suitability of Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) Implantation for Correction of Refractive Errors Without the Use of Dispersive Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Devices (OVDs),"The goal of this observational study is to test whether surgeries for lenses designed to be implanted in the eye to correct refractive error can be done without the need for using viscoelastic substances that are used routinely nowadays to make it easier to introduce them inside the human eye and protect the inside of the eye during the operation.

The main question it aims to answer is that is it safe to do the surgery without using them? to answer this question researchers will access recorded data of patients that underwent refractive surgeries in a private clinic since 2017 and compare them as two groups: those who underwent the traditional procedures and those who had it without the use of dispersive viscoelastics in regard to their vision before and after surgery, their ocular pressure and biomicroscopic analysis of the inside of their corneas before and after surgery.","Records of patients that had undergone ICL implantation surgery in Al-Ferdows private eye hospital in Baghdad between 2017 and 2023 were accessed. Two groups of patients were identified, for the first group the ICL was implanted with the use of both dispersive and cohesive OVDs (traditional OVD group) and for the second one a novel method of implantation was used without utilizing dispersive OVD (reduced OVD) group. Both types of surgery were done by the same surgeon and in the same settings. The operative notes of the OVD group were as follows: under topical anesthesia if the ICL is toric, manual corneal marking is done in the sitting position using pendular marker. After loading of the ICL, two-step clear corneal main incision 2.8 mm in width with a bit long track of 1.5-2 mm to enhance its valve action was fashioned. Intracameral injection of dispersive OVD. The ICL was implanted with mouth-to-mouth technique. Anterior chamber reformation with cohesive OVD, then haptics are gently pushed behind the iris using an olive-tipped manipulator, ensuring alignment to proper axis in case of toric ICL, otherwise spherical ICL is placed directly at 180° axis. After that, AC (anterior chamber) wash with irrigation/aspiration is performed then stromal hydration was done to seal the surgical wound. In the reduced OVD group, modification to the traditional method involved omitting the step of dispersive OVD injection and instead utilizing Intracameral injection of 1:1 mixture of 1:1000 adrenaline and 2% lidocaine in an overfilling manner. All other surgical steps are performed in an identical manner.

The study was ethically approved by the institutional review committee at the respective hospital and a similar committee at the college of medicine of university of Basrah according to the local guidelines and protocols.

The rate of progression is gradual and variable over the course of 10-20 years or longer. There is a need to better understand the disease-specific features of HIBM to heighten disease awareness; facilitate early diagnosis; identify patients; expand knowledge of the clinical presentation, progression and variation of the disease; identify and validate biomarkers and other efficacy measures; inform on the design and interpretation of clinical studies of investigational products; and eventually to optimize patient management.","The main objective of this program is to better understand HIBM.

The specific HIBM Disease Registry's objectives are to:

* Understand the geographic distribution and regional incidence/prevalence of GNEM.
* Obtain an assessment of the medical history, clinical presentation and progression of disease in GNEM patients and provide a connection for subjects to the broader GNEM community and associated programs.
* Provide customized information to subjects and their physicians that desire information on their disease status and progression.

The specific HIBM Natural History Study's objectives are to:

* Characterize HIBM disease presentation and progression over time using relevant clinical assessments of muscle strength and function.
* Obtain information to better characterize quality of life and understand the timing of significant life changing events in HIBM patients using patient-reported outcomes.
* Identify biomarkers and efficacy measures for use as endpoints in future clinical studies.","Inclusion Criteria:

The rate of progression is gradual and variable over the course of 10-20 years or longer. There is a need to better understand the disease-specific features of HIBM to heighten disease awareness; facilitate early diagnosis; identify patients; expand knowledge of the clinical presentation, progression and variation of the disease; identify and validate biomarkers and other efficacy measures; inform on the design and interpretation of clinical studies of investigational products; and eventually to optimize patient management. The main objective of this program is to better understand HIBM. The specific HIBM Disease Registry's objectives are to: * Understand the geographic distribution and regional incidence/prevalence of GNEM. * Obtain an assessment of the medical history, clinical presentation and progression of disease in GNEM patients and provide a connection for subjects to the broader GNEM community and associated programs. * Provide customized information to subjects and their physicians that desire information on their disease status and progression. The specific HIBM Natural History Study's objectives are to: * Characterize HIBM disease presentation and progression over time using relevant clinical assessments of muscle strength and function. * Obtain information to better characterize quality of life and understand the timing of significant life changing events in HIBM patients using patient-reported outcomes. * Identify biomarkers and efficacy measures for use as endpoints in future clinical studies.

Beth Israel Medical Center,OTHER,NCT02019979,Metformin and Carbohydrate Restriction With Platinum Based Chemotherapy In Stage IIIB/IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NS-NSCLC),Metformin With a Carbohydrate Restricted Diet In Combination With Platinum Based Chemotherapy In Stage IIIB/IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NS-NSCLC) - METRO Study,"Metformin is thought to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major sensor of cellular energy levels and a key enzyme limiting cellular growth during times of cellular stress. Once activated, this enzyme restricts anabolic processes such as protein, cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and inhibits mTOR, a protein kinase responsible for unregulated growth. MTOR is upregulated in a variety of tumors, including NSCLC providing rationale to take advantage of this pathway with metformin.","Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in both men and women. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 160,340 lung cancer related deaths occurred in 2012, accounting for about 28% of all cancer related deaths. Approximately 85% of lung cancer is classified as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with roughly two-thirds of these patients presenting with advanced disease. Histologically, NSCLC can be subdivided into adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, large cell, and non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be further classified. Those tumors that are not squamous (adenocarcinoma, large cell, not classified) are collectively termed as non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NS-NSCLC) and account for roughly 75% of all non small cell cancer cases.

The most accepted upfront treatment for patients with advanced stage NSCLC has been platinum based chemotherapy. Current standard practice for treatment of stage IV non-squamous NSCLC patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy has evolved over the past decade. In a sentinel study in 2005, Sandler and colleagues demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab to platinum doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) followed by maintenance bevacizumab conferred a survival advantage when compared to platinum doublet chemotherapy alone (12.1 mos vs. 10. mos) in patients with stage IV non squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. Following this, the largest phase III study ever conducted in stage IV NSCLC randomized more than 1700 patients with stage IV lung cancer to either cisplatin/pemetrexed or cisplatin/gemcitabine. This study was the first to reveal an interaction between chemotherapy and histology,demonstrating a survival advantage for the subset of patients with non-squamous cell treated with cisplatin/pemetrexed when compared to those treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine (11.0 vs 10 mos, p\<0.05. Building upon this, a recent study evaluating maintenance pemetrexed (continuing treatment after the four cycles of platinum doublet therapy) in non-squamous cell lung cancer demonstrated a significant survival advantage for patients receiving maintenance pemetrexed vs. placebo after four cycles of cisplatin/pemetrexed (13.9 mos vs. 11.0 mos, p\<0.05). Based on these studies, a regimen of cisplatin or carboplatin with pemetrexed followed by maintenance single agent pemetrexed has become one of the most accepted frontline treatments for patients with stage IV non-squamous, non small cell carcinoma.

Recently, there has been a firmer understanding of the relevant signaling pathways critical for lung cancer growth, leading to the development of novel, targeted therapies. The discovery of the EGFR and ALK pathways in lung cancer and the subsequent development of drugs that target these pathways, erlotinib and crizotinib respectively, has yielded unprecedented survival times in stage IV non-squamous, non small cell lung cancer. Unfortunately, only 25 to 30% of patients harbor these mutations, and platinum based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for the 60-70% of patients with stage IV disease without identifiable targets. In attempts to improve outcome, a large need remains to develop novel, effective agents to combine with platinum therapy that possess a favorable toxicity profile at a reasonable cost.

Metformin:

Metformin, an oral biguanide agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is now prescribed to more than 120 million people worldwide. Its glucose lowering effects result from both inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis and increased insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissue. Metformin has limited adverse effects with little or no risk of hypoglycemia in healthy, nondiabetic controls. In addition to its anti-diabetic properties, metformin has demonstrated both chemopreventative and therapeutic effects in both prostate and breast cancer. Jiralersprong et al reported that diabetic patients with breast cancer receiving metformin had a 24% complete pathological response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to only 8% of those in the non-metformin group. More recently Joshua et al reported reduced tumor Ki-67 rate as well as significant reductions in fasting glucose, insulin growth factor 1 and BMI (body mass index) in prostate cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant metformin prior to radical prostatectomy. Large epidemiological studies consistently have shown substantially lower incidence of cancer occurrence and death in diabetic patients taking metformin compared to those receiving other therapies. Most recently, a retrospective study of patients with ovarian cancer found that 5-year disease-specific survival was significantly better for diabetic patients who took metformin than for those who did not (67% vs 47%; P = .007). Based on these important observational studies, there are currently several, ongoing prospective studies evaluating metformin in nondiabetic patients with both early stage and late stage breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively.

The role of metformin as a preventative and therapeutic agent in lung cancer is beginning to be assessed. A recent epidemiological study from Taiwan demonstrated a 39-45% decreased risk of lung cancer in diabetic patients being treated with antidiabetic drugs including metformin versus those not taking these agents. These studies have triggered preclinical and clinical observational trials that further support metformin's potential as an antineoplastic agent. In a recent in vitro study, Ashinuma et al. was able to demonstrate inhibited clonogenicity, cell growth and proliferation in four different human lung cancer cell lines exposed to variable concentrations of metformin. These and other preclinical data have triggered in vivo experiments in mice. Memmott and colleagues showed that oral administration of 1 or 5mg/mL of metformin decreased lung tumor burden by 38% and 53% respectively in A/J mice injected with tobacco carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1 byutanone (NNK). Importantly, steady state levels of metformin were similar to those achieved in diabetic patients using metformin, suggesting the treatment and prevention of lung cancer could be achieved with standard oral dosing. Finally, two observational studies in humans have reinforced metformin's potential role as a therapeutic agent in lung cancer. In the first, Mezzone et al. showed that diabetic patients with lung cancer previously treated with metformin or thiazolidinediones had a lower incidence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and a reduced risk of death compared to those who did not receive the same treatment. More recently, a retrospective study performed by Tan et al. evaluated the outcomes of three groups of diabetic patients with NSCLC treated with first line chemotherapy and receiving various diabetic drugs. In this study, patients treated with chemotherapy with metformin had superior outcomes compared to those patients treated with chemotherapy with insulin or with drugs other than metformin (OS, 20 months vs. 13.1 months vs 13.0 months, respectively, p=0.007). The remarkable activity of this agent in both preclinical and clinical lung cancer models as well as its low toxicity and tolerability in non diabetic patients warrants further prospective studies evaluating the therapeutic efficacy with platinum based chemotherapy in NSCLC.

Metformin's Biological Effects:

A nascent understanding of metformin's biological effect on malignant cells may provide explanation to the aforementioned preclinical and clinical observations and solidifies the basis for further clinical exploration. Preclinical models suggest a variety of mechanism including inhibition of ""energy sensing"" pathways involved in cellular growth, interference with the IGF1-insulin axis and blockade of VEGF. Metformin is thought to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major sensor of cellular energy levels and a key enzyme limiting cellular growth during times of cellular stress. Once activated, this enzyme restricts anabolic processes such as protein, cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and inhibits mTOR, a protein kinase responsible for dysregulated growth. MTOR is upregulated in a variety of tumors, including NSCLC providing rationale to exploit this pathway with metformin. Secondly, metformin reverses hyperinsulinemia leading to down regulation of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). These factors are associated with malignant and non-malignant tumorogenesis via their aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, a well known pathway that contributes to tumorigenesis. Finally, metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, is a hallmark of cancer cells that constitutes an undisputed advantage in tumor growth. Despite this glycolytic shift, some malignant cells retain the capacity to continue oxidative phosphorylation for energy production which may enhance malignant potential. In vivo models indicate that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I thereby suppressing oxidative phosphorylation which may force cells to engage in survival processes like autophagy leading to eventual cell death. In summary, metformin's inhibition of tumor cell growth by disrupting both the MTOR and insulin pathways by AMP kinase activation represents a novel way to treat lung cancer.","Inclusion Criteria:

Once activated, this enzyme restricts anabolic processes such as protein, cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and inhibits mTOR, a protein kinase responsible for unregulated growth. MTOR is upregulated in a variety of tumors, including NSCLC providing rationale to take advantage of this pathway with metformin. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in both men and women. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 160,340 lung cancer related deaths occurred in 2012, accounting for about 28% of all cancer related deaths. Approximately 85% of lung cancer is classified as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with roughly two-thirds of these patients presenting with advanced disease. Histologically, NSCLC can be subdivided into adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, large cell, and non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be further classified. Those tumors that are not squamous (adenocarcinoma, large cell, not classified) are collectively termed as non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NS-NSCLC) and account for roughly 75% of all non small cell cancer cases. The most accepted upfront treatment for patients with advanced stage NSCLC has been platinum based chemotherapy. Current standard practice for treatment of stage IV non-squamous NSCLC patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy has evolved over the past decade. In a sentinel study in 2005, Sandler and colleagues demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab to platinum doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) followed by maintenance bevacizumab conferred a survival advantage when compared to platinum doublet chemotherapy alone (12.1 mos vs. 10. mos) in patients with stage IV non squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. Following this, the largest phase III study ever conducted in stage IV NSCLC randomized more than 1700 patients with stage IV lung cancer to either cisplatin/pemetrexed or cisplatin/gemcitabine. This study was the first to reveal an interaction between chemotherapy and histology,demonstrating a survival advantage for the subset of patients with non-squamous cell treated with cisplatin/pemetrexed when compared to those treated with cisplatin/gemcitabine (11.0 vs 10 mos, p\<0.05. Building upon this, a recent study evaluating maintenance pemetrexed (continuing treatment after the four cycles of platinum doublet therapy) in non-squamous cell lung cancer demonstrated a significant survival advantage for patients receiving maintenance pemetrexed vs. placebo after four cycles of cisplatin/pemetrexed (13.9 mos vs. 11.0 mos, p\<0.05). Based on these studies, a regimen of cisplatin or carboplatin with pemetrexed followed by maintenance single agent pemetrexed has become one of the most accepted frontline treatments for patients with stage IV non-squamous, non small cell carcinoma. Recently, there has been a firmer understanding of the relevant signaling pathways critical for lung cancer growth, leading to the development of novel, targeted therapies. The discovery of the EGFR and ALK pathways in lung cancer and the subsequent development of drugs that target these pathways, erlotinib and crizotinib respectively, has yielded unprecedented survival times in stage IV non-squamous, non small cell lung cancer. Unfortunately, only 25 to 30% of patients harbor these mutations, and platinum based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for the 60-70% of patients with stage IV disease without identifiable targets. In attempts to improve outcome, a large need remains to develop novel, effective agents to combine with platinum therapy that possess a favorable toxicity profile at a reasonable cost. Metformin: Metformin, an oral biguanide agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is now prescribed to more than 120 million people worldwide. Its glucose lowering effects result from both inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis and increased insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissue. Metformin has limited adverse effects with little or no risk of hypoglycemia in healthy, nondiabetic controls. In addition to its anti-diabetic properties, metformin has demonstrated both chemopreventative and therapeutic effects in both prostate and breast cancer. Jiralersprong et al reported that diabetic patients with breast cancer receiving metformin had a 24% complete pathological response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to only 8% of those in the non-metformin group.

The VHA is a leader in EMR implementation. It is believed that EMR use by physicians will improve patient-centeredness of visits, and healthcare outcomes. The proposed clinical trial addresses the need for rigorous research on EMR use, patient-centered care, and relevant health outcomes. Both physician-patient communication and EMR use are cross-cutting clinical issues with broad implications for patient care within the VHA. Consequently, the proposed project is directly related to the VHA's mission to use HIT to improve the quality health care for veteran patients.

BACKGROUND/RATIONALE EMRs can potentially improve quality and safety of ambulatory care. However, little research systematically documents the effect of EMRs on patient-centered care. Studies of the EMR's effect on patient-provider communication have been observational and had small sample sizes. Overall, these studies reported varied success regarding providers integrating the EMR into office visits, and suggest that further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of training providers in patient-centered communication and EMR use.

OBJECTIVES The PACE aims were to study how EMR use affects patient-provider communication behaviors, and patient-centered care and related health outcomes; to develop a unique provider training program tailored to patient-centered EMR use; and to evaluate the effect of the training intervention on patient-provider communication, patient-centered care, and provider EMR use.

METHODS

The study used a quasi-experimental (pre-post intervention design) carried out in three phases:

1. Pre-intervention: A pre-intervention patient-provider visit was conducted for each patient-provider pair. Visits were video recorded and reviewed for verbal and nonverbal patient-provider communication. MORAE software was used to record provider-EMR interaction data, including page views, navigation, and mouse clicks. Data were collected for related outcomes (patient and provider satisfaction).
2. Training: Findings from pre-intervention data guided development of a multifaceted provider training intervention promoting patient-centered EMR appropriation. The training intervention was delivered via a full day training workshop and individual feedback sessions.
3. Post-intervention: A second round of visits was conducted with the same patient-provider pairs and similar data were collected as in pre-intervention. Within group analyses (pre-post) were used to test whether the training intervention resulted in significant improvements in (a) patient-centered EMR use and (b) related outcomes (patient and provider satisfaction).

Probiotics has been shown to correct dysbiosis, reduce inflammation and strengthen the gut barrier. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of a three months intervention with a probiotic on intestinal inflammation, bowel symptoms, dysbiosis and gut permeability.","Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the top 5 most widely used drugs in the world. PPIs suppress the formation of gastric acid through the inhibition of hydrogen-potassium-adenosine-triphosphatase (H+ / K+ -ATPase) - a known proton pump in the parietal cells of the stomach. In practice, PPIs are commonly prescribed to treat GI disorders such as peptic ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflux. They are also used prophylactically to prevent stress ulcers and to reduce GI toxicity associated with certain medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and steroids, sometimes despite a paucity of evidence. PPI use has been associated with increased risk of enteric infections. A meta-analysis of 23 studies, comprising almost 300.000 patients, showed a 65% increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea among patients who used PPIs. Another meta-analysis of 11.280 patients, from six studies evaluating Salmonella, Campylobacter and other enteric infections, also found an increased risk due to acid suppression, with a greater association with PPI than with H2-receptor antagonists. Moreover, long term PPI use has been shown to be associated with bowel symptoms: A study from 2011 reported incidences of bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain and diarrhoea (43%, 17%, 7% and 2% of selected cases, respectively). In addition, PPIs are known to cause malabsorption of Vitamin B12 which may ultimately lead to Vitamin B12 deficiency. Very recently, PPI use was associated with an increase in mortality.

The gut microbiome plays an important role in enteric infections and bowel symptoms. The composition of the gut microbiome can inhibit or promote the microbial colonisation of the gut by microbial pathogens. Several mechanisms can influence bacterial growth or the immune system.

Long term PPI use is associated with profound changes in the gut microbiome. It is believed that these conditions are caused through the long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion (and thus shifting intragastric pH) which alters the natural habitat of resident microbiota. Furthermore, increased gastric pH might not sufficiently protect against oral or food-borne pathogens. We recently conducted a study at the Medical University of Graz where we could show that patients with long-term PPI therapy have dysbiosis associated with intestinal inflammation, increased gut permeability, bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation associated with a higher risk of complications and mortality in liver cirrhosis.

University of Salamanca,OTHER,NCT04385784,Postural Balance Program in Sedentary Older Adults.,Effectiveness of a Postural Control Exercise Program on Balance and Risk of Falls in Sedentary Older Adults.,"Introduction: Balance is one of the physical capacities that are altered due to the changes produced by aging. This represents an increased risk of falls in older adults. In Spain, the percentage of older people who fall each year is high and carries a series of important economic and social consequences. Sedentary lifestyle complicates this process, further increasing the risk of falls in older adults.

Objective: To design and apply a postural control exercise program to improve balance and reduce the risk of falls in healthy sedentary older adults.

Material and methods: Longitudinal, prospective, quasi-experimental study, in which a balance program of one weekly session for 24 weeks was developed. 112 healthy people over 60 years of age participated and were randomly divided into three work groups: Active Intervention Group (GIA), Sedentary Intervention Group (GIS) and Control Group (CG). His steady state and risk of falls were analyzed with the following functional tests: Tinetti Scale, Timed Up \& Go Timed Test (TUG), One-Legged Stance Test (OLS), Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB) and 30 Second Chair Stand Test (30SCST). The GIA and GIS carried out the balance program and received a workbook to carry out at home. The CG only performed the home exercises.","INTERVENTION PROTOCOL The target population of our study were older people belonging to one of the older people's associations in the town of Salamanca. The program was offered in the different associations and an inscription sheet was passed in which they had to provide different information related to their personal situation. All the people he wanted signed up.

Once all the participants enrolled in the program, a draw of places was done to guarantee the randomization of the sample, assigning the participants to the intervention group or the control group.

To ensure a sample size with a confidence level of 95% and an error rate of 10%, a larger sample of 96 people was assumed. A total of 112 participants were included in the program.

An initial assessment was made of all program participants, regardless of the group to which they were assigned. In this session, they were given an informed consent that they had to sign it in order to participate in the program.

The most important data when selecting the elderly is the level of physical activity they carry out in their day to day. In this way, the elderly were divided into two groups: a trained group, that is, who was doing physical activity at the current time and had done it during the previous year, regardless of the type it was, according to the criteria established by WHO; and a sedentary group, which included those elderly who did not meet the minimum criteria for recommended physical activity.

Initial Assessment

The initial assessment was carried out during the first week of the intervention. All the participants did it regardless of the group to which they belonged. The following tests were carried out to evaluate the participants:

* Anthropometric analysis (weight, height, BMI).
* Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale.
* Tinetti Scale (balance and gait).
* Timed Up \& Go Test.
* One-leg Stance test.
* 30 Second Chair Stand Test.

Intervention Groups Both the intervention group made up of active people (AIG) and the group made up of sedentary people (SIG), started the intervention after carrying out the initial assessment. To avoid bias, the participants and the physiotherapists in charge of giving the sessions were blinded without knowing the group to which they belonged. Only the principal investigator responsible for conducting the initial assessment knew about the division.

Participants developed the balance program for a total of 24 weeks. The sessions were performed once a week, lasting 55-60 minutes.

The sessions had an individual part and a group part, with a short break within them.. In addition to the exercise protocol as such, guidelines were taught to perform the home-based workbook in a safe and appropriate manner.

After this period, a final assessment was carried out, where all the participants were reviewed again.

Intervention

For the design of the standard session, warm-up exercises, muscle strength, postural control and stretching were included, in addition to dedicating time to hydration. Hydration is not considered exercise as such, but it is considered necessary during the session, since it is essential for older people. The plan used to design the sessions is detailed below:

1. Warm-up.
2. Muscle strength exercises.
3. Individual postural control exercises.
4. Hydration.
5. Groupal postural control exercises.
6. Stretching and ventilation exercises. It is recommended to wear comfortable and wide clothing that allows the necessary movements to be carried out and avoids friction and discomfort. The indicated shoes are comfortable sports shoes, avoiding high-heeled shoes, shoes that are too tight or shoes that do not fit well and produce imbalances.

Before starting the program, the participants were informed that they should try to carry out the exercises as correctly as possible, making an effort, but that each person should adapt the exercise to their level, carrying out the activity safely and avoiding dangers. In addition, the physiotherapists in charge of directing the activity, during the progression of the sessions indicated to the participants those variations that they considered necessary for the exercise to be safe but effective, progressing in the difficulty as the physical condition of the participant required it.

At the beginning of the session there was a greeting and a count of the participants, to control attendance and check the clothing of each one.

1. - Warm-up The warm-up always includes the same exercises, which allow the participants to become familiar with them and introduce the exercises of strength and postural control. This part of the session includes the first 10 minutes of it.
2. - Exercises of muscular strength These exercises are performed for approximately 10 minutes. The exercises are alternated throughout the sessions, in such a way that, each week, the upper or lower body is worked more.
3. - Individual postural control exercises The duration of this part of the session is approximately 10 minutes, alternating exercises throughout the program. During this part of the session, the physical therapists who lead the activity pay special attention to how the participants perform the exercises, correcting and giving the appropriate instructions when necessary.
4. - Hydration Each session is given a break of approximately 5 minutes to hydrate. In each session, participants are reminded to bring a bottle of water or juice to hydrate properly. Older adults are a risk group for dehydration. This can be aggravated during physical exercise. Therefore, it is recommended to hydrate during the sessions, to avoid problems associated with dehydration, such as urinary infections, constipation or hypotension.
5. - Groupal postural control exercises After hydration, the session is continued with postural control exercises, but including group activities so that there is a more playful part and, thus, increase the motivation of the participants.
6. - Stretching and ventilation exercises At the end of the previous activity, stretching exercises of the different muscle groups are carried out, as well as mobility exercises accompanied by respiratory movements to return to rest and lower heart rate. This part of the session lasts approximately 10 minutes.
7. - Precautions and exercises to avoid Exercises that keep the head below the level of the waist, which involve hyperflexion, hyperextension, or hyperrotation of the spine or other joints, should be avoided.

Exercises must be done safely and comfortably. Any exercise that causes discomfort or pain on the participants should be avoided.

All exercises must be carried out safely, if they require supports they must be stable and physiotherapists must ensure that no participant is in danger of falling..

Control Group The target population were older people who decided to enroll in the program voluntarily and who were sedentary, that is, who did not meet the WHO criteria of recommended physical activity for their age group.

The objective of having this control group was to determine the effectiveness of the program and the usefulness of having a professional who teaches and trains individuals. We wanted to see if the program improved the physical capacity of the participants and if the presence of a professional as well as attendance at a regular activity is beneficial and determines greater changes in the subjects' abilities.

The control group should be composed of sedentary people, since in previous studies it was seen that attendance at physical activity programs, such as the Geriatric Revitalization Program (PReGe) carried out by the University of Salamanca, determined sufficient changes to improve the balance of participants.

The group consisted of those participants who during the draw were not selected for the intervention group. Not all of them formed the group but after the initial assessment and determine the level of physical activity each were selected those who were sedentary, and those who were active were excluded from the study.

During the assessment session, they were also given a notebook where some exercises to improve balance were explained in detail and they were instructed to do them at least twice a week.

After 24 weeks, they were asked to pass the assessment tests again and thus it was determined whether the indication of home-base exercise had any effect on the physical abilities of the subjects.

Final Assessment At the end of the intervention period, a final assessment was carried out by both groups, which included the same tests as the initial assessment.

Statistical analysis of the data For the storage, treatment and statistical analysis of the data, the statistical package IBM-SPSS-Statistics, version 23.0, for Windows was used.

The data was digitized and, afterwards, an exhaustive descriptive analysis of all the variables was performed to detect possible errors in the collection or digitization of the data, mainly affecting the maximum and minimum of the quantitative variables.

Once the definitive data matrix was defined, a descriptive analysis of the different variables and data collected during the initial assessment was carried out, as well as an analysis of data by protocol. To determine which statistic corresponds to them, firstly, a normality test of each variable was performed with the Shapiro-Wilk Test, one of the most powerful tests, especially with small samples, as is our case.

In the event that the variable followed a normal distribution, the mean (M) and standard deviation (DT) were calculated. If the variable did not follow the normal distribution, the median and interquartile range were calculated. In the case of categorical variables, the results were expressed in percentages.

The descriptive study was carried out, segmenting the sample and dividing it by sex, age, activity level and BMI.

In the descriptive analysis of the variables related to balance and the risk of falls, the percentage of people who were at risk of falls was calculated for each of the variables.

For the comparative analysis between two quantitative variables, the T-Student test was used, if the variables behaved normally, and the U-Mann-Withney test when any of the variables did not follow a normal distribution.

In the case of categorical or qualitative variables, they used contingency tables and the Chi-square test to analyze the results obtained.

For the inferential analysis of the data, whenever there were more than two variables for the analysis, the F-Snedecor test (ANOVA) was performed if the variables were normal, or the H-Kruskal-Wallis test, when any of the variables were not maintained a normal distribution.

Contrast tests were performed, in the event that there were significant differences in the tests of multiple variables. To determine between which groups there were differences, t tests were used to determine the contrast.

The calculation of correlations was also performed, using the Pearson's correlation coefficient, for quantitative variables, or the Spearman correlation coefficient, in the event that any of the variables was categorical.

In all analyzes, a 95% confidence interval was established with significance indices of p \<0.05. The results obtained have been expressed with the value of the statistician, as well as the p-values and those data that are most interesting for the interpretation of the results.","Inclusion Criteria:

Effectiveness of a Postural Control Exercise Program on Balance and Risk of Falls in Sedentary Older Adults. Introduction: Balance is one of the physical capacities that are altered due to the changes produced by aging. This represents an increased risk of falls in older adults. In Spain, the percentage of older people who fall each year is high and carries a series of important economic and social consequences. Sedentary lifestyle complicates this process, further increasing the risk of falls in older adults. Objective: To design and apply a postural control exercise program to improve balance and reduce the risk of falls in healthy sedentary older adults. Material and methods: Longitudinal, prospective, quasi-experimental study, in which a balance program of one weekly session for 24 weeks was developed. 112 healthy people over 60 years of age participated and were randomly divided into three work groups: Active Intervention Group (GIA), Sedentary Intervention Group (GIS) and Control Group (CG). His steady state and risk of falls were analyzed with the following functional tests: Tinetti Scale, Timed Up \& Go Timed Test (TUG), One-Legged Stance Test (OLS), Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB) and 30 Second Chair Stand Test (30SCST). The GIA and GIS carried out the balance program and received a workbook to carry out at home. The CG only performed the home exercises. INTERVENTION PROTOCOL The target population of our study were older people belonging to one of the older people's associations in the town of Salamanca. The program was offered in the different associations and an inscription sheet was passed in which they had to provide different information related to their personal situation. All the people he wanted signed up. Once all the participants enrolled in the program, a draw of places was done to guarantee the randomization of the sample, assigning the participants to the intervention group or the control group. To ensure a sample size with a confidence level of 95% and an error rate of 10%, a larger sample of 96 people was assumed. A total of 112 participants were included in the program. An initial assessment was made of all program participants, regardless of the group to which they were assigned.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde,OTHER,NCT01862679,Randomised Study of High-flux Haemodialysis and Haemodiafiltration,"Single Blind, Prospective, Randomised Comparative Study of High-flux Haemodialysis and Haemodiafiltration","The most common forms of renal replacement therapy currently in use are high flux haemodialysis (HF-HD) and haemodiafiltration (HDF). Although these techniques appear similar to the patient, there are important differences in what happens to the blood as it travels through the dialysis machine.

During HDF, the machine controls hydrostatic pressure across the dialyser to remove additional water together with toxins from the blood and this fluid volume is continually replaced with an ultra-pure solution. HDF has a theoretical advantage removing more waste substances, especially larger molecules, from the blood than HF-HD which may be of benefit to the patient in the medium to long term.Despite the theoretical advantages, trials have so far been unable to find any significant difference in death rates or the development of health problems among patients on HDF or HF-HD.

It is therefore important to examine other factors which may help doctors and patients to decide which treatment to use. The investigators have designed a study which aims to answer three main questions:

1. Does HDF make patients feel better?
2. Is blood pressure more stable on HDF in comparison with HF-HD?
3. Are Phosphate levels and other blood parameters better controlled with HDF than HF-HD?

The investigators will do this by randomly assigning patients on HF-HD to receive 2 months of either HF-HD or HDF with as equivalent treatment prescriptions as possible and without the patient knowing which treatment they are receiving. After two months the patients will switch to the alternative form of dialysis for a further two months. During the study the investigators will ask the patients how long it took them to recover from the preceding session of dialysis, assess the frequency of symptomatic low blood pressure and also perform blood tests at set intervals to measure specific blood parameters.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),NIH,NCT00137384,Movement-Related Brain Networks Involved in Hand Dystonia,The Role of Cortical Coherence in Focal Hand Dystonia,"This study will use various methods to measure the activity of the motor cortex (the part of the brain that controls movements) in order to learn more about focal hand dystonia. Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. In focal dystonia, just one part of the body, such as the hand, neck or face, is involved.

Patients with focal hand dystonia and healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Each candidate is screened with a medical history, physical examination and questionnaire. Participants undergo the following procedures:

Finger Movement Tasks

Subjects perform two finger movement tasks. In the first part of the study, they move their index finger repetitively from side to side at 10-second intervals for a total of 200 movements in four blocks of 50 at a time. In the second part of the study, subjects touch their thumb to the other four fingers in sequence from 1, 2, 3 and 4, while a metronome beats 2 times per second to help time the movements. This sequence is repeated for a total of 200 movements in four blocks of 50 at a time.

Electroencephalography

This test records brain waves. Electrodes (metal discs) are placed on the scalp with an electrode cap, a paste or a glue-like substance. The spaces between the electrodes and the scalp are filled with a gel that conducts electrical activity. Brain waves are recorded while the subject performs a finger movement task, as described above.

Magnetoencephalography

MEG records magnetic field changes produced by brain activity. During the test, the subjects are seated in the MEG recording room and a cone containing magnetic field detectors is lowered onto their head. The recording may be made while the subject performs a finger task.

Electromyography

Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles. This study uses surface EMG, in which small metal disks filled with a conductive gel are taped to the skin on the finger.

Magnetic resonance imaging

MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. The patient lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow metal cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning. Most scans last between 45 and 90 minutes. Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 30 minutes at a time, and can communicate with the MRI staff at all times during the procedure.

Questionnaire

This questionnaire is designed to detect any sources of discomfort the subject may have experienced during the study.","Objective

Dystonia is a disabling movement disorder that manifests with sustained co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, giving rise to abnormal twisted postures and overflow of muscle activity. Abnormal neurophysiologic parameters of the somatosensory and motor cortex have been demonstrated, although it is unclear how these changes lead to the predominant motor manifestations. In normal voluntary movement, communication between sensory and motor cortices is important and these interactions may be dysfunctional in dystonia. Coherence is a powerful method used to assess brain communication and has been instrumental in demonstrating the interregional interactions involved in normal movement. Inappropriate connectivity in terms of the duration of communication or the extent of spread over sensorimotor areas may give rise to the involuntary overflow of movements that characterize dystonia. We propose to examine changes in coherence associated with disorganized movements to yield insight as to the brain networks involved in the development and expression of the disease.

Study population

Patients with focal hand dystonia and normal volunteers will take part in the study.

Design

In this study, EEG/MEG coherence analysis will be used to investigate corticocortical and corticomuscular interactions during voluntary hand movements in focal hand dystonia patients and normal subjects. Power spectral changes in the beta and alpha frequency range over the hand sensorimotor cortex will be studied using a 28-channel EEG montage while subjects perform various tasks involving the hand. The interregional coherence between sensory and motor, premotor and motor, and interhemispheric cortices will be assessed for changes between study populations.

Outcome Measures

Comparison of interregional coherence changes will be performed between dystonia patients and normal volunteers as well as between affected and unaffected sides. Furthermore, coherence changes will be compared between rest and during task performance.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

GW873140 is a new type of anti-HIV drug called a CCR5 receptor antagonist. CCR5 is a receptor on T cells (a type of white blood cell) where HIV-1 enters and then infects the cell. GW873140 is intended to block the CCR5 receptor so that HIV-1 cannot enter the cell.

HIV-1-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood and urine tests. Some of the blood drawn is used to test the patient's HIV-1 type to see if the study drug might lower the amount of HIV-1 in the blood. Women who can become pregnant have a pregnancy test.

Participants are hospitalized for 12 days. They are randomly assigned to take one of the following four treatments for 10 days: 1) 200 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient); 2) 200 mg of GW873140 twice a day, or placebo; 3) 400 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo; or 600 mg of GW873140 twice a day, or placebo. Participants record the meals they eat on a diary card. In addition, they undergo the following tests and procedures:

During treatment

* Assessment of HIV classification (day 1)
* Review of meal diary cards (days 1,2,3,4,5,8, and 10)
* Review of any HIV-associated conditions, other medications taken besides the study drug, and well-being (days 1,2,3,4,5,8,10, and 11)
* Check of vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature (days 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10, and 11)
* Weight assessment (days 1 and 10)
* Electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity of the heart (days 1,2,3,8, and 10)
* Blood draws for routine laboratory tests, to measure T-cell counts, and to measure HIV levels (days 1,2,5,10, and 11)
* Urine tests (days 1 and 10)

Post-treatment

* Blood tests to monitor the effect of GW873140 on lowering HIV counts (days 12, 15, 17, and 19)

Follow-up visit (2 weeks after last drug dose--day 24)

* Review of medications taken and general well-being
* Check of vital signs
* Physical examination
* Blood and urine tests.","The development of resistance to all currently marketed drugs for HIV infection has been observed and is a major reason for failure of therapy. In particular, there is a great need for drugs against new targets and having novel mechanisms of action against new targets. Most of the currently approved drugs are targeted toward the inhibition of viral enzymes. However, the process of viral entry and fusion has become an active area of research. Among the steps involved in viral entry, binding of HIV to CD4 co-receptors on the cell surface is an important and promising target for new drug development.

GW873140 is a CCR5 antagonist that is in Phase I clinical development as a viral entry inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. GW873140 has demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity with an IC50 against CCR5-tropic HIV-1 of 1nM equals about 0.5ng/mL), that is shifted 8-10 fold (10nM equals about 0.5ng/mL) in the presence of physiological concentrations of human plasma proteins. A study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating single (50-1200mg) and repeat (200-800mg BID) doses of GW873140 has been conducted in 70 healthy volunteers (GW873140/001). Preliminary results indicate that GW873140 is well-tolerated up to a dose of 1200 mg following single dose and 800 mg BID following multiple-dose. Additionally, food was shown to increase the AUC and Cmax of a 400 mg single dose by 1.7-and 2.2-fold, respectively.

Concentrations above the protein binding corrected IC90 are achieved following oral dosing and in vivo binding studies in healthy subjects demonstrate greater than 97% receptor occupancy 2 and 12 hours after multiple doses and 68-88% receptor occupancy 24 hours after a single dose, despite plasma concentrations below or near detectable limits.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

GW873140 is a new type of anti-HIV drug called a CCR5 receptor antagonist. CCR5 is a receptor on T cells (a type of white blood cell) where HIV-1 enters and then infects the cell. GW873140 is intended to block the CCR5 receptor so that HIV-1 cannot enter the cell. HIV-1-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, and blood and urine tests. Some of the blood drawn is used to test the patient's HIV-1 type to see if the study drug might lower the amount of HIV-1 in the blood. Women who can become pregnant have a pregnancy test. Participants are hospitalized for 12 days. They are randomly assigned to take one of the following four treatments for 10 days: 1) 200 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient); 2) 200 mg of GW873140 twice a day, or placebo; 3) 400 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo; or 600 mg of GW873140 twice a day, or placebo. Participants record the meals they eat on a diary card. In addition, they undergo the following tests and procedures: During treatment * Assessment of HIV classification (day 1) * Review of meal diary cards (days 1,2,3,4,5,8, and 10) * Review of any HIV-associated conditions, other medications taken besides the study drug, and well-being (days 1,2,3,4,5,8,10, and 11) * Check of vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature (days 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10, and 11) * Weight assessment (days 1 and 10) * Electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity of the heart (days 1,2,3,8, and 10) * Blood draws for routine laboratory tests, to measure T-cell counts, and to measure HIV levels (days 1,2,5,10, and 11) * Urine tests (days 1 and 10) Post-treatment * Blood tests to monitor the effect of GW873140 on lowering HIV counts (days 12, 15, 17, and 19) Follow-up visit (2 weeks after last drug dose--day 24) * Review of medications taken and general well-being * Check of vital signs * Physical examination * Blood and urine tests. The development of resistance to all currently marketed drugs for HIV infection has been observed and is a major reason for failure of therapy. In particular, there is a great need for drugs against new targets and having novel mechanisms of action against new targets. Most of the currently approved drugs are targeted toward the inhibition of viral enzymes. However, the process of viral entry and fusion has become an active area of research. Among the steps involved in viral entry, binding of HIV to CD4 co-receptors on the cell surface is an important and promising target for new drug development. GW873140 is a CCR5 antagonist that is in Phase I clinical development as a viral entry inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. GW873140 has demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity with an IC50 against CCR5-tropic HIV-1 of 1nM equals about 0.5ng/mL), that is shifted 8-10 fold (10nM equals about 0.5ng/mL) in the presence of physiological concentrations of human plasma proteins. A study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating single (50-1200mg) and repeat (200-800mg BID) doses of GW873140 has been conducted in 70 healthy volunteers (GW873140/001). Preliminary results indicate that GW873140 is well-tolerated up to a dose of 1200 mg following single dose and 800 mg BID following multiple-dose. Additionally, food was shown to increase the AUC and Cmax of a 400 mg single dose by 1.7-and 2.2-fold, respectively. Concentrations above the protein binding corrected IC90 are achieved following oral dosing and in vivo binding studies in healthy subjects demonstrate greater than 97% receptor occupancy 2 and 12 hours after multiple doses and 68-88% receptor occupancy 24 hours after a single dose, despite plasma concentrations below or near detectable limits.

Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,OTHER,NCT03058302,Study of Effectiveness and Implementation of a Mental Health Intervention With Conflict-affected Communities in Ukraine,Study of Effectiveness and Implementation of Different Versions of the CETA Mental Health Intervention Among Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and Veterans in Ukraine,"This project aims to contribute to the development of a community mental health care system while directly serving the conflict affected population in east Ukraine. This project is being supported by USAID's Victims of Torture Fund. In the Spring of 2015, the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Applied Mental Health Research Group (AMHR) was invited to make a site visit to Ukraine with USAID to make an initial assessment of current mental health problems, service capacities, and treatment need. AMHR and USAID were requested by community-based partners to provide training and support in evidence based trauma treatment for people affected by war and displacement. Extensive conflict within the borders of Ukraine is a new experience for most Ukrainians, and local psychologists and psychotherapists were not prepared for wide-spread need or trained in appropriate methods of treatment for affected populations. JHU and USAID began activities in Ukraine in June 2015 and have identified the counseling intervention, Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), as appropriate and relevant for this context. Community providers from the three trial sites (Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhia) have been trained in CETA as counselors and local supervisors.

An ongoing training and supervision model (Apprenticeship Model) is being implemented in the three study sites. These three sites contain significant numbers of military veterans (demobilized soldiers from the ongoing conflict) and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Adult IDPs and Veterans from the three study sites will be recruited and screened to identify those with elevated depression and/or posttraumatic stress symptoms and impaired functioning. This study will be conducted as a 3-armed randomized controlled trial. This study will test to see if both the long and a short version of CETA are effective compared to a wait-control condition.","This research team developed the CETA intervention and has evaluated its effectiveness in multiple trials. CETA was developed based on other transdiagnostic interventions that have proven efficacious in the United States and Europe. Briefly, full length CETA includes 12 weekly treatment sessions comprised of cognitive behavioral elements. In the last few years, as more researchers have identified mental health interventions that can successfully reduce the burden of symptoms for clients in low-resource settings, there has been a push to develop intervention models that are more scalable. One of the barriers to scalability may be duration of treatment, as clients may not complete treatment if there are too many sessions, and counselors may be limited in the number of clients they can treat over the course of a year when each client requires more sessions. However, the trade-off of potential reduction in treatment efficacy has not been evaluated for shortened- versus standard-length treatment models of efficacious interventions. This study will begin to address this by testing to see if both the long and a short version of CETA are effective compared to wait-control condition. Community providers from the three trial sites (Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhia) have begun ongoing training in CETA as counselors and local supervisors.

This study will be conducted as a 3-armed randomized controlled trial. Adult IDPs, Ukrainian military veterans, and their family members in 3 Ukrainian cities, Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhia, will be recruited on a rolling basis and screened to identify those with elevated depression and/or posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms and impaired functioning using a locally validated assessment instrument. Local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and existing service providers have been provided with a locally validated short clinical assessment instrument (developed during a previous phase of the current research). As part of regular services, these organizations will use this instrument to assess their clientele for need for specific clinical services. If the assessment suggests that the person is in need of services and the person agrees to seek help they will then refer them to the study's monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) staff who will meet with each potential participant and conduct a repeat screening to ensure trial eligibility. Those who meet the eligibility criteria on this second screen will be consented for the study. All eligible and consented adults will be randomly allocated to either a wait-list control condition, the Brief CETA model, or the Full CETA model. After randomization, those allocated to either CETA arm will be referred to one of the local counselors or supervisors, all of whom are trained in both versions of CETA (Brief and Full). for purposes of blinding those allocated to a CETA arm (and their counselors) will not be aware of whether they are receiving the full CETA (12 sessions) or the short CETA (5 sessions). This information will be revealed to the provider and client after the 4 session, so that they can plan either to end treatment at the 5th session or continue. All study participants in all 3 arms will be assessed on a monthly basis for 6 months post-baseline. After completion of their participation in the trial those assigned to the wait-control condition will be able to receive CETA services.

At the 1st monthly data collection point post treatment completion, study participants in the short CETA and long CETA intervention arms will also be interviewed using a Client Dissemination and Implementation Research (D\&I) instrument that explores aspects of program implementation from the client perspective. In addition, the first 30 participants (total N=60) to complete both versions of CETA will also be asked to provide a qualitative interview upon completion of their treatment exploring unexpected effects of the program, both positive and negative. Data from these D\&I interviews will be used to improve the program. Data from the qualitative interview will also be used generate additional locally important items to add to the study impact assessment instruments. This expanded version of the instrument will be completed by later study participants.

CETA providers (counselors and supervisors) will be interviewed after 6 months of providing CETA services using both a Provider Dissemination and Implementation (D\&I) instrument and a qualitative interview. The purpose of the provider D\&I instrument is similar to that for the clients, but from the provider perspective (i.e., to identify aspects of program implementation that should be changed in order to improve the program). The purpose of the qualitative interview is the same as the D\&I instrument but to identify unknown factors affecting implementation that are not referred to in the instrument. important local information from the latter will not be added to the D\&I instrument but will be included in reports as qualitative data only.

This project is being supported by USAID's Victims of Torture Fund. In the Spring of 2015, the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Applied Mental Health Research Group (AMHR) was invited to make a site visit to Ukraine with USAID to make an initial assessment of current mental health problems, service capacities, and treatment need. AMHR and USAID were requested by community-based partners to provide training and support in evidence based trauma treatment for people affected by war and displacement. Extensive conflict within the borders of Ukraine is a new experience for most Ukrainians, and local psychologists and psychotherapists were not prepared for wide-spread need or trained in appropriate methods of treatment for affected populations. JHU and USAID began activities in Ukraine in June 2015 and have identified the counseling intervention, Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), as appropriate and relevant for this context. Community providers from the three trial sites (Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhia) have been trained in CETA as counselors and local supervisors.

Primary outcome:

• Difference in postoperative pain comparing preemptive use of PO versus IV acetaminophen

o Mean Visual analog Scale (VAS) scores will be compared between the intervention group (PO acetaminophen) and the control group (IV acetaminophen).

Secondary outcomes:

* Difference in postoperative analgesic use between groups

  o Narcotics, NSAIDs
* Difference in postoperative N/V between groups

  o Patient rated measure - none, mild, moderate, severe
* Cost comparison between drugs","Hypothesis: Postoperative pain will be equivalent in patients receiving preemptive oral acetaminophen as compared to patients receiving preemptive intravenous acetaminophen following minimally invasive benign gynecologic surgery.

Importance/significance: Adequate control of postoperative pain is important for patient satisfaction, adequate healing, and optimizing length of stay. The idea of preemptive analgesia (giving an analgesic prior to first skin incision to prevent sensitization of nerve pathways from the trauma of surgery) has been shown in many studies to improve postoperative pain. Intravenous acetaminophen has been found to be an effective agent when given preemptively, and many surgeons have adopted this practice. Unfortunately, the IV formulation of acetaminophen, unlike the oral formulation, is expensive as it is a relatively new drug. There are other oral analgesics (i.e. Celebrex) that have been found to be efficacious for postoperative pain control when given preemptively. There are no studies in gynecologic surgery, however, comparing the effectiveness of PO acetaminophen with IV acetaminophen. Given that PO acetaminophen is significantly cheaper than the IV formulation, this could result in cost savings for hospital systems while maintaining adequate patient comfort and satisfaction.

Primary outcome:

1. Difference in postoperative pain comparing preemptive use of PO versus IV acetaminophen
2. Mean VAS scores will be compared between the intervention group (PO acetaminophen) and the control group (IV acetaminophen).

Secondary outcomes:

1. Difference in postoperative analgesic use between groups - Narcotics, NSAIDs
2. Difference in postoperative N/V between groups
3. Patient rated measure - none, mild, moderate, severe
4. Cost comparison between drugs

Methods:

Patients scheduled to undergo minimally invasive benign gynecologic surgery will be randomized to one of two groups:

Group 1: acetaminophen 1 gram PO 30min before surgery, then saline placebo IV after anesthesia induction but before skin incision

Group 2: receives placebo pill PO 30min before surgery, then acetaminophen 1 gram IV after anesthesia induction but before skin incision

Primary outcome: After surgery, postoperative pain measured at various time points by blinded investigator

2 hours postop, 4 hours postop, 24 hours postop

1. Evaluate N/V - self-rated as none, mild, moderate, severe

We enrolled 52 patients scheduled for elective ambulatory TRA. 2 patients were excluded after randomization. Patients were randomized into two groups:

A. Group A= no distal peripheral nerve blocks (no dPNBs group; n = 24 ): We performed usual anesthetic technique for surgery: an AXILLARY BRAQUIAL PLEXUS BLOCK using SHORT ACTING local anesthetic (mepivacaine 1%). Patients allocated in this group didn't received any additional intervention in the postoperative period.

B. Group B (dPNBs group; n = 26): We performed the same anesthetic technique for surgery (AXILLARY BLOCK with 1% of mepivacaine) with an additional intervention. Patients allocated in this group received postoperatively dPNBs on target nerves. Based on surgical approached and technique we evaluated that radial and median nerves were responsible for the innervation of the surgical area, and therefore responsible for the postoperative pain. We performed dPNBs ON RADIAL AND MEDIAN NERVES (TARGET NERVES) WITH LONG ACTING AND LOW CONCENTRATION LOCAL ANESTHETIC (0,125% levobupivacaine 5ml/nerve).

All blocks were performed under ultrasound guidance.

Analgesic regime prescribed at discharge was the same in both groups: dexketoprofen with tramadol for rescue analgesia.

The primary outcome was to evaluate the proportion of patients experienced moderate to severe pain during first and second day postoperatively, mesured using a numerical visual scale (NVS) of 0 to 10 (0= no pain and 10= worst pain imaginable). We defined mild pain (NVS 0-3), moderate pain (NVS 7-10) and severe pain (NVS 7-10).

We considered dPNBs effective when patients experienced mild pain (NVS 0-3) for at least 6 hours after dPNBs puncture.

Secondary outcomes included:

1. Maximum pain intensity during first and second day postoperatively.
2. Duration of dPNBs, defined as the interval between dPNBs performance and the occurrence of first pain.
3. Time to discharge, defined as the interval since patient arrived at postoperative care unit (PACU) until discharge home.
4. Presence of distal hand motor block after dPNBs puncture.
5. Needed for rescue analgesia and total consumption of tramadol during first and second day postoperatively
6. Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting during 1st and 2nd day postoperatively
7. Needed for rescue antiemetic therapy, total consumption of ondansetron and effectiveness of treatment during 1st and 2nd day postoperatively.

University of South Florida,OTHER,NCT01789684,Cluster Randomized Trial Comparing Interventions to Enhance Genetic Counseling Among Breast Cancer Patients,A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Interventions to Enhance Utilization of Genetics Services Among Breast Cancer Patients,"RATIONALE: Multi-faceted provider education and decision support intervention will increase the rate of appropriate referral of breast cancer patients at increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to genetic counseling.

PURPOSE: This cluster randomized controlled trial will compare active and passive interventions to increase the rate of appropriate genetic counseling referrals of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at increased risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the community oncology setting.","Approximately 5-10% of all breast cancer patients have hereditary breast cancer, the majority due to an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (BRCA mutation carriers). Breast cancer patients who are BRCA mutation carriers have up to a 65% risk for a new primary breast cancer in the future. Additionally, BRCA mutation carriers have a 10-45% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer.

Effective options to decrease these high future cancer risks are available to breast cancer patients who learn they carry a BRCA mutation - including prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy. Prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy reduce the risks for future primary breast cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively, by more than 90%. Because of the high risks for future cancer and the opportunity for effective risk reduction among mutation carriers, national guidelines consistently recommend referral of breast cancer patients at increased risk for hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to genetic counseling by a qualified genetics professional. Lack of implementation of this standard of care constitutes an error of omission and jeopardizes patient outcomes.

We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare a ""passive intervention"" - dissemination of professional guidelines - with an ""active intervention"" - a multi-faceted provider education and decision support intervention to improve 1) appropriate referral of breast cancer patients at risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the community cancer center setting and 2) pre-surgical referral among newly diagnosed patients.

Although the clinical importance of music has been recognised in other pathological situations, further research is needed to investigate the effect of music on postoperative pain.

For several years ""ischemic"" electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in the acute phase of ischemic stroke have been reported. Whether these ECG changes reflect true myocardial ischemia remains controversial. So far no study has assessed different markers of myocardial ischemia or necrosis in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with an acute ischemic stroke.

Purpose

The main purpose of this study is to determine the potential burden of reversible and irreversible myocardial ischemia in patients with an acute ischemic stroke.

Patients and methods

Serial blood samples for measuring troponin T, CK-MB and NT-proBNP are collected in 250 patients with evidence of an acute ischemic stroke admitted to the Department of Neurology at Odense University Hospital. In addition resting 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained on a daily basis, and a 24-hour ST-segment ambulatory monitoring will be performed once within the first week of hospitalisation. Finally, myocardial perfusion patterns during rest will be evaluated by means of a myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with an elevated troponin T level.

Six months later control measurements of troponin T, CK-MB and NT-proBNP and a 12-lead ECG will be obtained.

Expectations

The study will contribute with original observations in patients with acute ischemic stroke considering the following issues:

1. The prevalence and characteristics of ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia.
2. The prevalence of transient ST-segment changes on ambulatory monitoring.
3. The prevalence and degree of myocardial necrosis as judged from biochemical markers.
4. The prevalence of reversible and irreversible perfusion defects on myocardial scintigraphy.
5. The prevalence, size and patterns of NT-proBNP.
6. Whether there is a change in ECG and biochemical markers over a 6-month follow-up period.

The secondary purpose is to assess the anatomical aspect and the quality of sexual life. To search a correlation between the anatomical result, the general and sexual quality of life. To compare the different techniques of medical follow-up in terms of anatomic results, general quality of life, sexual quality of life, complications and morbidities.

To evaluate social inclusion of these women with their family situation, social and professional category and their job.

At the same time, we propose an evaluation with a psychologist to study the impact of the announcement of the diagnosis. This impact study is conducted at a distance from diagnosis.","The MRKH syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by absence of uterus and at least the two thirds of the vagina, a female phenotype and a normal karyotype XX.

These patients have normal ovaries and fallopian tubes. The external genitalia are normal. This syndrome was described by Mayer (1829), Rokitansky ( 1838), Kuster ( 1910) and Hauser ( 1961). About one in every 4500 female babies has this condition. This syndrome represents 85% of congenital vagina aplasia and is the second cause of primary amenorrhea after disorders of sexual development. These women are unfertile.

The malformation can be isolated or associated with other malformations called MURCS (Müllerian duct aplasia, renal aplasia, and cervicothoracic somite dysplasia), as kidney ( 30%), bone ( 10%) or cardiac malformations ( 1%).

The most common age for MRKH to be diagnosed is when the woman hasn't started her period ( 85%).Some girls may find out at an earlier age when there is a severe malformation , during a systematic gynaecological examination or during an pelvic ultrasound. When the women are older, the syndrome can be diagnosed during studies for infertility.

A pelvic ultrasound is usually the first test performed to assess presence of uterus. A magnetic resonance imaging may be used to complete the investigations. These tests can also confirm if there are two ovaries and two kidneys. Sometimes, a very small uterus can be seen, it's a uterine horn.

The psychological management is essential to take care of the women affected.It seeks to understand the impact of the diagnosis announcement and the various treatments offered. The follow-up can be different for each girl and her parents during several appointments.

Therapeutic management can be proposed when the girl is ready because the therapeutic is long and difficult. Two therapeutic approaches can be proposed: to create a vagina using dilators or having a surgical procedure. In France, vaginal reconstruction with dilators is the most used. This method consists in dilating the vagina progressively with different sizes of dilators in order to obtain a vaginal opening of 8 cm around 6 months after treatment initiation. This method is successful in about 75% of cases. Complications are exceptional.

Surgery is an option for patients who are unsuccessful with dilatators or patients who prefer surgery. A number of operations are appropriate for the correction of vaginal agenesis. Vecchietti procedure and sigmoid vaginoplasty are the most commonly used techniques in France.

In national and international publications, it is impossible to compare scientifically the results of the different technique because of the small effective in each studies and because of the the lack of standardized assessment. Studies report the functional result for each technique but none compare the techniques used. No studies compared the result in terms of anatomical and function results, complications and quality of life.

The demonstration of a positive correlation between the anatomic criteria and the functional results would help to guide the surgical technique. The lack of correlation would suggest that a perfect anatomical reconstruction is not essential. If it is demonstrated, the management should focus on other criteria like psychological management. Several factors seem to influence the general and sexual quality of life of women affected by the Rokitansky syndrome.

Mayo Clinic,OTHER,NCT00934479,Intestinal Microecology in Chronic Constipation,The Intestinal Microecology in Chronic Constipation,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether the bacteria normally present in the bowels are different in people with constipation and to see what effect the treatment with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - approved drug, lubiprostone, has on these bacteria.","Chronic constipation is a common condition with a heterogeneous pathophysiology and resulting clinical manifestations. Recent evidence in the literature and collected in our laboratory confirm that there are differences in the gut microbiota between healthy individuals and those with a variety of disorders (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and obesity) suggesting that the development of certain disorders may be determined by the composition of the gut microbiota. Existing evidence warrants further investigation of the role of the microbial ecology of the human gut in constipation and an exploration of modification of the gut microbiota as a means to treat constipation by its actions on the colonic metabolism of nutrient substrates to alter colonic transit and fluid fluxes.

The proposed research will exploit our proven capability to use high-throughput molecular genomic techniques to define the intestinal microbiome in order to help define the role of the gut microbiota in chronic constipation and will explore the potential value of altering the microbiota as a management strategy in constipation. The linkage of high-throughput genomic analyses with cause-and-effect understanding of how the gut microbiota affects bowel function may lead to a reliable means to manage the gut microbiota with the intent to prevent and/or treat constipation. The immediate goals of this project are to expand on existing information about the microbial ecology in the human intestines focusing on its relationship with constipation using molecular microbiological techniques and to assess the effects on the gut microorganisms resulting from the use of the FDA-approved medication, lubiprostone. Lubiprostone is a member of a novel therapeutic class called prostones and is an orally active, bicyclic fatty acid that selectively acts on type 2 chloride channels to stimulate chloride secretion which induces a net increase in luminal fluid secretion. Unlike antibiotic, probiotic and prebiotic agents, it has no known direct effects on the gut microbiota. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of chronic constipation in men and women and for women with constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS). The rationale for using lubiprostone to modify the gut microbiota stems from the use of similar strategies for controlling recalcitrant small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (i.e., altering fluid fluxes in the gut lumen).

We believe that this research will greatly improve our understanding of the role that the gut microbiota play in the development of constipation and potentially lead to new strategies with which to combat this common problem.","Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Subjects:

IHF GmbH - Institut für Herzinfarktforschung,OTHER,NCT06742684,Hyperoxemic Oxygen Therapy in Patients With Acute Anterior Myocardial Infarction,Hyperoxemic Oxygen Therapy in Patients With Acute Anterior Myocardial Infarction,"The HOT-AAMI study investigates the efficacy of supersaturated oxygen therapy (SSO2) as an adjunct to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation in patients suffering from acute anterior myocardial infarction (AMI). This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, two-arm, randomized (1:1) clinical trial conducted in Germany.

Objective:

The primary aim is to assess whether SSO2 therapy reduces the risk of mortality and heart failure progression after PCI compared to PCI alone. Secondary endpoints include cardiac morbidity, quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), and adverse events over 12 months.

Study Design:

The trial involves 1,266 patients randomized to receive either the SSO2 therapy post-PCI or PCI alone. Participants must be adults with acute anterior AMI and undergo successful PCI within 6 hours of symptom onset. Recruitment is expected to span 36 months with a follow-up period of 12 months for each participant.

Intervention and Control:

Intervention group: SSO2 therapy delivered intracoronary using hyperoxygenated blood.

Control group: Standard PCI with stent placement without adjunctive therapy.

Primary Endpoint:

The combined outcome of all-cause mortality or unplanned hospital/ambulatory visits for heart failure requiring intravenous diuretics within 12 months post-randomization.

Background and Rationale:

AMI treatment often leaves significant myocardial damage despite successful PCI. Prior studies on SSO2 therapy have demonstrated potential benefits, including reduced infarct size and improved myocardial function, with evidence suggesting reduced heart failure rates and improved long-term survival.

Statistical Power:

The study anticipates a primary endpoint event rate of 16% in the control group, with a hypothesized hazard reduction of 25% in the intervention group. A total of 393 events across 1,266 patients are needed to achieve an 80% power at a 5% significance level.

Safety and Monitoring:

A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will oversee the trial. Adverse events will be documented and reported according to protocol guidelines.

Expected Outcomes:

If successful, the study may provide evidence for integrating SSO2 therapy into clinical practice, potentially lowering mortality and morbidity in AMI patients, with implications for both patient care and healthcare costs.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

Unity Health Toronto,OTHER,NCT02481479,Saxagliptin and Cardiac Structure and Function,SCARF: Saxagliptin on CArdiac StRucture and Function,"Diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of heart failure, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the development of new therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control, recent clinical data from the saxagliptin assessment of vascular outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (SAVOR-TIMI) 53 study observed an unexpected finding of an excess of adjudicated heart failure hospitalizations. This excess occurred in the setting of pre-existing heart failure (HF) hospitalization and in those with elevated biomarkers for heart failure such as N terminal pro Brain type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). A wealth of preclinical data did not suggest a mechanistic basis for an excess of heart failure events, however these preclinical studies primarily focused upon prevention based strategies as opposed to regression studies once established heart failure was present. This proposal seeks to understand if and how dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i,specifically saxagliptin) may influence the development of heart failure, by evaluating changes in cardiac structure and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","The cardiovascular safety and potential cardioprotective effects of diabetes drugs have been the focus of recent research. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all new anti-diabetic drugs to demonstrate no important increase in cardiovascular adverse events before approval.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are oral incretin-based agents that increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level, with proven anti-hyperglycemic effects and are increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes. In a rat model of diabetes and myocardial infarction, sitagliptin treatment improved passive left ventricular compliance, increased endothelial cell density, reduced myocyte hypertrophy and collagen abundance. GLP-1 and DDP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin improve cardiac function, cardiac remodeling, and survival in animal models of pressure-overload and chronic heart failure. However, in another study of post-MI cardiac remodeling in mice, vildagliptin failed to show any early or late protective effects on cardiac function.

Some clinical studies suggest that GLP-1 infusion is associated with an absolute increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure, although data are conflicting. The GLP-1 receptor analog, exenatide may reduce infarct size in patients with myocardial infarction but does not improve LVEF.

The Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Alogliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome EXAMINE trial randomized assigned 5340 patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome to alogliptin or placebo, and found no increase in adverse cardiovascular events in the alogliptin group. In SAVOR-TIMI 53, 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events were randomized to receive saxagliptin or placebo. Over a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P=0.99 for superiority; P\<0.001 for noninferiority). However, patients in the saxagliptin group were more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure, which was not ascertained in the EXAMINE trial. Furthermore, the Sitagliptin Cardiovascular Outcome Study (TECOS), which examined the DPP4i sitagliptin versus placebo in high risk patients for a cardiovascular event demonstrated cardiovascular safety (P\<0.001 for non inferiority), and there was no signal for excess heart failure hospitalizations.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as the ""gold standard"" for measuring LV volume, mass, and ejection fraction. LV volume measurements by cardiac MRI do not rely on geometric assumptions. CMR measurements have excellent intra-observer, inter-observer, and inter-study variability, which were superior to other imaging techniques. The high inter-study reproducibility of CMR affords a substantial reduction in the required sample size to demonstrate even small changes in LV volume, LV mass or LVEF, or conversely, to reliably exclude clinically important changes. Furthermore, CMR tagging allows detailed and quantitative assessment of regional LV diastolic and systolic function. For example, in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), CMR can detect subtle alterations in global and regional LV functions in patients with traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Although prior studies have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects of improved glycemic control on myocardial function, CMR promises to be a more sensitive and accurate technique.

Accordingly, the investigators propose to use CMR to examine the cardiac structure, global and regional function among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with saxagliptin.","Inclusion Criteria:

Baylor College of Medicine,OTHER,NCT06004479,Maternal Carotenoids Across Pregnancy Study,Effect of Pregnancy and Lactation on Carotenoid Status and Bioactivity,"Before infants are born, they depend on their mother to provide the nutrients necessary to grow and develop, such as iron, folic acid, iodine and other vitamins and minerals. Pregnant people also rely on good nutrition to support their own health. In addition to essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, there are other natural components found in fruits and vegetables, called phytochemicals, that may support maternal and fetal health during pregnancy.

While more is known about the role of phytochemicals in adult health, surprisingly little is known about phytochemical nutrition during pregnancy. This study focuses on a group of phytochemicals, called carotenoids, during pregnancy.

The study will determine if and why levels of carotenoids in the body change across the course of pregnancy. Understanding carotenoid nutrition during pregnancy will improve the understanding ofnutrition needs of expectant mothers and their infants. To study these questions, both health pregnant and non-pregnant female adults will report on their dietary intake and participate in body measurements, health surveys, and carotenoid measurements of eyes, skin, and blood at time points corresponding with the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy as well as post-partum.","What a pregnant person eats is important for their own health and the health of their infant during pregnancy and after birth. Fruits and vegetables contain colorful substances called ""carotenoids"" which support the nutritional needs of the pregnant person and the infant, may fight inflammation, and may even benefit the person's memory and thinking ability. A person's carotenoid status can be measured with a blood sample and with optical measurements of the skin and eye. What isn't known, is if or why a pregnant person's carotenoid status changes over the course of pregnancy and the early post-partum period, and if those changes have consequences for pregnant person's and infant's health.

The goal of this study is to better understand how and why body levels of carotenoids, change during pregnancy and the post-partum period. We will study whether these changes can be explained by pregnancy, a person's diet, and changes in body composition. We will study if changes in a female's carotenoid status are associated with changes in memory or thinking ability, levels of inflammation, and her infant's carotenoid levels.

Ultimately, this information can guide nutrition advice for future pregnant people.

This study involves 5 study visits for the pregnant or non-pregnant adult female participants with an option to enroll infants for the final, post-partum, visit. For the four follow-up visits, adult participants will have body measurements, will complete surveys, and will provide a blood sample. At the final visit, lactating participants will be asked to provide a milk sample.

"University Hospital, Toulouse",OTHER,NCT02164279,Validation of Biomarkers of Diabetic Nephropathy in Type I Diabetic Children,Identification and First Validation of Early Non-invasive Biomarkers of Diabetic Nephropathy in Type I Diabetic Children,"About 30 to 40% of patients suffering from type I diabetes are at risk of developing a diabetic nephropathy (DN) leading more or less rapidly to an end-stage renal disease. Nowadays, the microalbuminuria is the most often used clinical parameter for possible onset of DN. However, it is a late (because it permits to detect a renal disease already present), non-specific and low sensitive biomarker.

Therefore the main objective of this study is to identify early urinary biomarkers predictive of DN in children with type I diabetes, before the appearance of a microalbuminuria.","Once the type I diabetes is diagnosed, the speed of progression to a DN is very variable. Thus, the discovery of biomarkers able to distinguish progressor patients from non-progressor since the appearance of a microalbuminuria, is crucial in order to take care of progressor patients the earlier and to slow down the disease progression.

The investigators have shown that urine is a biological sample extremely well suited for proteome analysis with the aim to identify biomarkers of renal damages. Indeed, they were the first to analyze the urinary proteome of infant using capillary electrophoresis-coupled mass spectrometry. This technic permits to analyse the entire urinary proteome of a person in one hour.

Several laboratories tried to identify other predictive urinary biomarkers of the development of a DN in diabetic patients, but with limited success and nowadays in the clinical practice they still use the measure of the microalbuminuria. Contrary to precedent studies, the investigators develop an analysis without a priori and starting with early samples (without any signs of DN) associating the urinary peptide profile with the DN progression over 9-10 years.

This is a nested case-control study in a cohort of 317 patients constituting the urinary biological collection. (The urinary samples of a type I diabetic cohort of 317 patients seen between 2004 and 2008 have been collected.) These patients will be contacted at the end of 2012 to obtain a number of participation of 180 patients authorizing the use aposteriori of their urinary samples. Among this cohort, the investigators evaluate at 90 the number of patients with a DN defined by a dosage of microalbuminuria higher than 100 mg/L.

The primary endpoint of this study is therefore the identification of urinary biomarkers predictive of DN in type I diabetes pediatric patients.

The secondary endpoints are :

* The estimation of sensibility and specificity parameters, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC).
* The identification of factors associated with the variability of biomarkers expression such as the age at the moment of the diagnosis, the time between the diagnosis and the urinary collection, the rate of microalbuminuria, and the type of insulin used by the patient.

Massachusetts General Hospital,OTHER,NCT03542084,Endocrinology Auto-Triggered e-Consults,Impact of Endocrinology Auto-triggered E-consults on Glycemic Control,"Diabetes currently affects 25.8 million people in the U.S. Patients with diabetes are generally managed, at least initially, by a primary care practitioner (PCP). As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, PCPs are under increased pressure to achieve recommended glycemic targets. Failure to achieve these targets has been shown to increase clinical complications and cost of care.

Endocrinology referral is common for those patients not meeting A1c goals. Unfortunately, access to specialty endocrinology care is limited and patients routinely wait weeks or months before being seen. Electronic consultation (e-consult) is a new and innovative delivery model that has the potential to provide greater access to specialty care. The current system at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) allows PCPs to electively place an e-consult to solicit specialist input. Specialists in turn review the patients chart, relevant data and the clinical question and respond within the electronic medical record. E-consults have been well received by both patients and physicians, not only at MGH, but also across many centers in the US. With that said, the e-consult system remains in its infancy and current literature largely focuses on process metrics without hard clinical end-points.

One way to optimize care for patients with diabetes is to automatically trigger an endocrinology e-consult for those not meeting A1c targets.

Treatment of up to three de novo lesions in a maximum of two epicardial vessels, with a maximum of two lesions per epicardial vessel. If only a single lesion is to be treated, it must be a target lesion. Up to one non-target lesion can be treated. Non-target lesion treatment can occur only in a non-target vessel.

If there are two target lesions within the same epicardial vessel, the two target lesions must be at least 15 mm apart per visual estimation; otherwise this is considered as a single target lesion for lesion (and stent) length determination and must be treated with a single study device.

1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated or quantitatively assessed %DS of ≥50% and \< 100%, with a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow of ≥ 1, and one of the following: stenosis ≥ 70%, an abnormal functional test (e.g., fractional flow reserve ≤0.80 AND/OR a positive stress test), or presentation with an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or NSTEMI within 2 weeks of index procedure, or STEMI \>72 hours but ≤ 2 weeks prior to the index procedure).

1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with reference vessel diameter (RVD) by visual estimation of ≥ 2.50 mm and ≤ 3.75 mm.
2. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with length by visual estimation of ≤ 24 mm.

Note: Subjects with Unstable angina (UA) or NSTEMI or STEMI occurring \> 2 weeks of the index procedure can be included in the trial but should be categorized based on their current angina class.

Note: To exclude enrollment of excessively small vessels, if the operator believes that based on visual angiographic assessments, the distal reference vessel diameter is ≤ 2.75 mm such that the plan is to implant a 2.5 mm device (stent or scaffold) in a target lesion, it is strongly recommended that either on-line QCA or intravascular imaging (ultrasound or optical coherence tomography) is used and demonstrates that the measured distal RVD for this target lesion is ≥ 2.50 mm (by at least one of these imaging modalities). This measurement may be performed before or after pre-dilatation, but before randomization. If the distal RVD measures \<2.5 mm, that lesion IS NOT ELIGIBLE for randomization. Such a lesion may be treated as a non-target lesion.

For subjects presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), LVEF must be assessed within 1 week of the index procedure and after ACS presentation, which may include contrast left ventriculography during the index procedure but prior to randomization in order to confirm the subject's eligibility.
7. Subject has undergone prior PCI within the target vessel during the last 12 months. Prior PCI within the non-target vessel or any peripheral intervention is acceptable if performed anytime \>30 days before the index procedure, or between a minimum of 24 hours and 30 days before the index procedure if successful and uncomplicated.

University of Arizona,OTHER,NCT01339702,The EPIC Project: Impact of Implementing the EMS Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Guidelines,Impact of Implementing the EMS Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Guidelines,Evaluation of the impact (on survival and other outcomes) of implementing the Brain Trauma Foundation/National Association of EMS Physicians Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) guidelines in the prehospital EMS systems throughout the state of Arizona.,"* Significance: Approximately 1.4 million victims of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are seen in emergency departments each year in the U.S. and, of those, 50,000 die and 235,000 are hospitalized. A least 2% of the U.S. population has a TBI-related long-term need for help to perform activities of daily living. There is growing evidence that the management of TBI in the early minutes after injury profoundly impacts outcome. This has led to the promulgation of evidence-based TBI treatment guidelines by authoritative national and international scientific bodies. Reports on guideline implementation in the hospital setting are very promising. However, no studies have evaluated their impact in the prehospital setting. While randomized prehospital trials to identify the effectiveness of the guidelines would clearly be optimal, the strong indirect evidence currently precludes withholding guideline therapy because of ethical considerations. Thus a large, prospective, historically controlled, observational study is the best methodology currently available to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing the guidelines in the prehospital setting.
* Specific Aim: To test the hypothesis that implementation of the TBI guidelines in a statewide EMS system will reduce mortality and improve non-mortality outcomes in adults and children with moderate to severe TBI.
* Objective #1: Implement the nationally-vetted TBI guidelines across a broad variety of EMS systems (urban, suburban and rural) throughout the State of Arizona. This will be accomplished through the statewide collaboration between the University of Arizona, the Arizona Department of Health Services, and local EMS agencies responding to 85% of the state's population. This will mirror the approach that has been successfully employed to study and document a tripling of patient survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the state.
* Objective #2: Collect prehospital EMS and trauma center data on severe TBI patients cared for by participating EMS agencies to determine pre-implementation and post-implementation injury severity/risk-adjustment measures and outcomes.
* Objective #3: Evaluate the impact of prehospital guideline implementation on the following outcomes: 1) Overall mortality (primary outcome), 2) mortality among patients who are intubated prior to hospital arrival, and 3) non-mortality outcomes such as hospital/intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days, and patient disposition.
* Relevance/health impact: The societal burden of TBI is immense. While the potential for dramatically reducing morbidity and mortality by early treatment appears to be great, the effectiveness of the prehospital guidelines remains unproven. Demonstrating the impact of guideline therapy would potentially lead to widespread implementation of the effective interventions. This could dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality from this major public health problem. On the other hand, if the guidelines are not effective despite confirmed implementation across a wide variety of EMS systems throughout the entire state, this would provide the ethical basis for conducting future randomized trials.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Adults and children with physical trauma who: 1) are transported directly to or are transferred to a level I TC by participating EMS agencies, 2) have hospital diagnosis(es) consistent with TBI (either isolated or multisystem trauma that includes TBI), and 3) meet at least one of the following definitions for severe TBI: a) last prehospital GCS or first hospital/trauma center GCS \<9; b) AIS-head of ≥3, c) CDC Barell Matrix-Type 1, d) undergo prehospital ETI, nasal intubation, or cricothyrotomy.

Reports on guideline implementation in the hospital setting are very promising. However, no studies have evaluated their impact in the prehospital setting. While randomized prehospital trials to identify the effectiveness of the guidelines would clearly be optimal, the strong indirect evidence currently precludes withholding guideline therapy because of ethical considerations. Thus a large, prospective, historically controlled, observational study is the best methodology currently available to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing the guidelines in the prehospital setting. * Specific Aim: To test the hypothesis that implementation of the TBI guidelines in a statewide EMS system will reduce mortality and improve non-mortality outcomes in adults and children with moderate to severe TBI. * Objective #1: Implement the nationally-vetted TBI guidelines across a broad variety of EMS systems (urban, suburban and rural) throughout the State of Arizona. This will be accomplished through the statewide collaboration between the University of Arizona, the Arizona Department of Health Services, and local EMS agencies responding to 85% of the state's population. This will mirror the approach that has been successfully employed to study and document a tripling of patient survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the state. * Objective #2: Collect prehospital EMS and trauma center data on severe TBI patients cared for by participating EMS agencies to determine pre-implementation and post-implementation injury severity/risk-adjustment measures and outcomes. * Objective #3: Evaluate the impact of prehospital guideline implementation on the following outcomes: 1) Overall mortality (primary outcome), 2) mortality among patients who are intubated prior to hospital arrival, and 3) non-mortality outcomes such as hospital/intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days, and patient disposition. * Relevance/health impact: The societal burden of TBI is immense. While the potential for dramatically reducing morbidity and mortality by early treatment appears to be great, the effectiveness of the prehospital guidelines remains unproven. Demonstrating the impact of guideline therapy would potentially lead to widespread implementation of the effective interventions. This could dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality from this major public health problem. On the other hand, if the guidelines are not effective despite confirmed implementation across a wide variety of EMS systems throughout the entire state, this would provide the ethical basis for conducting future randomized trials. Inclusion Criteria: * Adults and children with physical trauma who: 1) are transported directly to or are transferred to a level I TC by participating EMS agencies, 2) have hospital diagnosis(es) consistent with TBI (either isolated or multisystem trauma that includes TBI), and 3) meet at least one of the following definitions for severe TBI: a) last prehospital GCS or first hospital/trauma center GCS \<9; b) AIS-head of ≥3, c) CDC Barell Matrix-Type 1, d) undergo prehospital ETI, nasal intubation, or cricothyrotomy. Exclusion Criteria: * Patients with brain injury from: 1) non-mechanical mechanisms (e.g., drowning); 2) choking, primary asphyxiation, or strangulation; 3) environmental injury (e.g., hyperthermia); 4) poisoning (e.g., drug overdose, carbon monoxide, insecticides); 5) intracranial hemorrhage of non-traumatic origin; 6) other non-traumatic, acute neurological emergencies (e.g., bacterial meningitis)."
Biruni University,OTHER,NCT06939179,Effect of Face Mask Therapy on Blood Oxygen Levels,Evaluation of the Effect of Face Mask Therapy and RPE Application on Blood Oxygen Levels,"Skeletal Class III malocclusions are characterized by maxillary retrusion, mandibular protrusion, or a combination of both. In growing individuals presenting with maxillary deficiency, the face mask appliance is widely recognized as one of the most effective and frequently utilized orthopedic interventions. The primary objective of face mask therapy is to stimulate forward and downward growth of the maxilla by disarticulating and activating the circummaxillary sutural system. The application of protraction forces via a face mask results in anterior displacement of the maxillary dentition, accompanied by lingual inclination of the mandibular incisors. Orthopedic effects of the appliance typically include forward and downward movement of the maxilla with a slight degree of upward rotation, posterior dental extrusion, and backward rotation of the mandible. Numerous studies have demonstrated that combining rapid maxillary expansion (RME) with face mask therapy enhances skeletal outcomes, especially when initiated during the early stages of growth. Delayed intervention is often associated with reduced orthopedic responsiveness.

Foersch et al. evaluated the effects of pre-treatment rapid maxillary expansion on face mask therapy outcomes and concluded that expansion positively influences sagittal skeletal changes. In the absence of expansion, greater dental compensation was observed, particularly in the transverse dimension. From a clinical standpoint, anterior crossbite correction can typically be achieved within approximately 3 to 4 months, depending on the severity of the malocclusion. However, establishing a stable overbite and molar relationship usually requires an additional 4 to 6 months of treatment. A prospective clinical study analyzing treatment outcomes in Class III patients reported that overjet correction occurred through 31% maxillary advancement, 21% mandibular retraction, 28% labial proclination of the maxillary incisors, and 20% lingual retroclination of the mandibular incisors. To compensate for potential adverse effects of late mandibular growth, overcorrection of the overjet and molar relationship has been recommended. RME has also been associated with significant anatomical and functional changes in the upper airway. Specifically, an increase in the width of the nasal cavity base leads to a reduction in nasal airway resistance and improvement in nasal respiration. Recent investigations have documented post-treatment increases in pharyngeal airway dimensions and corresponding enhancements in nasal breathing. In a clinical study involving 25 patients with Class III malocclusion due to maxillary deficiency, face mask therapy resulted in a significant increase in nasopharyngeal airway space, which remained stable after a four-year follow-up period. Another study comparing 18 patients treated with RME and face mask therapy against an untreated control group of 163 individuals demonstrated a statistically significant enlargement of the nasopharyngeal space in the treated group. Pulse oximetry operates based on two fundamental physical principles. First, arterial blood generates a pulsatile signal, while non-pulsatile signals originate from venous and capillary beds. Second, modern oximeters utilize light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emitting at wavelengths of 660 nm (red) and 940 nm (infrared), as oxyhemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin display distinct absorption spectra at these wavelengths. In a study conducted by Niaki et al., among patients exhibiting mouth breathing patterns, 65.4% were classified as hypoxemic, while 34.6% had normal oxygen saturation levels. Gender analysis revealed that 31.4% of males and 40% of females demonstrated normal oxygen saturation.Mouth breathing has been shown to influence craniofacial growth and may contribute to the development of various malocclusion patterns. Conversely, specific malocclusion types can exacerbate oral breathing tendencies. It is important to acknowledge that oral respiration has a measurable impact on blood oxygen levels and overall respiratory function.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

These tissues help control actions such as running, jumping, grasping, and lifting. Without tendons it would be difficult to control the movement of your body. A protective layer known as synovium covers tendons. This sheath produces fluid, which keeps the tendon lubricated and moving properly. Inflammation or swelling of the sheath is known as tendon sheath inflammation or tenosynovitis. This condition is often treated with an injection into or around the sheath. This injection often consists of a corticosteroid with or without lidocaine. Corticosteroid(CS) are drugs that decrease inflammation and are given for a number of orthopaedic conditions to decrease symptoms of the underlying disease. Lidocaine is also a drug that blocks the pain response, although it only blocks it momentarily. The study aims to determine if corticosteroid injection alone is as effective as corticosteroid combined with lidocaine for the relief of tenosynovitis of the upper extremity.

This study will leverage Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills as an experimental intervention to determine if preschool emotion regulation develops more rapidly as a result of improvements in mothers' ability to regulate her own emotions. The knowledge from this study will identify a modifiable pathway by which maternal BPD places offspring at risk for later mental disorders and will quantify how much improvement in children's ability to regulate their emotions can be achieved by treating mothers alone.","Borderline personality disorder is a serious mental illness characterized by extreme emotions, chaotic interpersonal relationships, suicidal behaviors, and a poor sense of self. Offspring of mothers with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are at an elevated risk for developing mental illness across the lifespan. Difficulty managing emotions are a hallmark feature of BPD, and yet the ability to do so is necessary for responding effectively to childrens' emotions. This process is called maternal emotion socialization, which has a major impact on how children develop their own emotion regulation (ER) skills. ER develops rapidly during preschool and deficits in preschool ER are recognized as underlying future mental disorders. This proposal will test a model examining the extent to which maternal ER and emotion socialization impact child ER, which may be a significant pathway by which mental health problems are transmitted to offspring of mothers with BPD. This proposal will leverage Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Skills training, a robust and effective method for improving ER as a tool to change maternal ER in mothers with BPD. By completing multiple assessments of biobehavioral markers of child and mother ER, this study is poised to uncover a potentially modifiable pathway by which these offspring are at risk. Specifically, the investigators propose to conduct a stratified randomized controlled trial of DBT Skills for mothers with BPD who have preschoolers. A total of 300 dyads (initial child age: 36-54 months) will be collected in Eugene, Oregon and Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, with 100 pairs in each of three groups: children who have mothers with BPD who receive DBT Skills, children who have mothers with BPD who receive Family Services as Usual, and children who have non-disordered mothers, matched on income, with this final group only participating in assessments (as to quantify normative ER growth). All children will be assessed 4 times every 2-months, with the first assessment occurring prior to treatment assignment. Investigators will use a biobehavioral laboratory battery to measure child ER, assessing emotion understanding, strategy use, attention regulation and inhibitory control, and parasympathetic regulation. In mothers, a similar multi-method approach to assess emotion acceptance, strategy use, recognition, and parasympathetic regulation will be employed. Finally, during each laboratory assessment, there will be observations of mother's ability to effectively respond to children in the context of child negative emotions. Growth curve modeling will chart child ER trajectories for all 3 groups so that investigators can compare child ER growth as a function of: group status (DBT Skills vs. Family Services as Usual vs. income matched, non-disordered controls), changes in maternal ER, and changes in maternal emotion socialization. Findings from this proposal will identify a modifiable pathway by which offspring of mothers with BPD are at risk, determine the extent to which child ER can be restored by treating mothers, and will be the first DBT Skills trial to measure outcomes in offspring.","Inclusion Criteria:

Investigators will use a biobehavioral laboratory battery to measure child ER, assessing emotion understanding, strategy use, attention regulation and inhibitory control, and parasympathetic regulation. In mothers, a similar multi-method approach to assess emotion acceptance, strategy use, recognition, and parasympathetic regulation will be employed. Finally, during each laboratory assessment, there will be observations of mother's ability to effectively respond to children in the context of child negative emotions. Growth curve modeling will chart child ER trajectories for all 3 groups so that investigators can compare child ER growth as a function of: group status (DBT Skills vs. Family Services as Usual vs. income matched, non-disordered controls), changes in maternal ER, and changes in maternal emotion socialization. Findings from this proposal will identify a modifiable pathway by which offspring of mothers with BPD are at risk, determine the extent to which child ER can be restored by treating mothers, and will be the first DBT Skills trial to measure outcomes in offspring. Inclusion Criteria: * Have a child who is 3 years old; have custody of child; endorse at least 3 symptom criteria of BPD in which one symptom must be affective instability and uncontrollable anger; have a verbal IQ of at least 70 Exclusion Criteria: * Does not have custody of child; child has known developmental disabilities; mother is psychotic; mother has suicidal ideation + an active plan; mother has low verbal IQ"

This project will examine the feasibility of an AVG intervention using the GAIMplank.,"Replacing sedentary behaviors during leisure time with active video gaming (AVG) has been shown to be an enjoyable option for increasing the amount of physical activity acquired each week. A growing body of literature indicates that increases in energy expenditure can be achieved during AVG play in people with physical disabilities, including those with mobility impairments such as cerebral palsy (CP), spinal cord injury, stroke, and other neurological conditions. AVGs are particularly important for people with disabilities given the higher rate of inaccessible features in the built environment and the difficulty in finding activities they enjoy. Since AVG devices are relatively affordable, they also hold promise as a scalable product for promoting higher levels of physical activity and fitness among people with disabilities.

There continues to be a pressing need to make gaming controllers accessible to people who are unable to stand for long periods, cannot stand on a small platform due to poor balance or extreme obesity, or who are unable to stand and are full-time wheelchair users. The GAIMplank controller, was developed and tested for usability among people with mobility impairments. During usability testing, a sample of 21 adults were able to successfully access and play a series of standard PC video games using trunk/body movements to produce game play action. Using validated survey tools, participant usability scores and qualitative feedback indicated above average usability for the GAIMplank system.

University of Novi Sad,OTHER,NCT06294002,Neuromuscular Training & Postural Stability,Effect of Different Neuromuscular Training Modalities on Postural Stability in Healthy Recreation People: A Randomised Controlled Trial,"Background: Postural stability (PS) is a vital function that helps maintain equilibrium during standing still, locomotion, and any activities requiring high balance performance. Under static and dynamic conditions, PS is a fundamental factor for the quality of movement in everyday activities or sports. PS and adaptive ability are required in sports due to the interactions between the sensory and motor systems, which regulate postural adjustments by processing information from the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems, as reported by previous studies. The interest in using different exercises and protocols for improving PS in sports and physiotherapy has grown in the last few decades. Experts have proposed various training modalities to increase neuromuscular stability, balance, postural control, and general stability. Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS) is a complex of correction exercises with a neuromuscular approach based on improving breathing, fundamental movements, and principles of developmental kinesiology. Whole body vibration training (WBV) is a neuromuscular training approach that has recently become very popular among researchers and practitioners in health and sport. It is usually used as an additional method in a conventional training routine. Designing the training program to achieve the optimal benefits for PS in healthy young adults is important in general personal health management. Although different training protocols have improved PS and general stability in everyday activities, there is still considerable debate regarding the optimal exercise modalities within an exercise program. Aim: The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of dynamic neuromuscular stabilisation (DNS), whole-body vibration (WBV), and a combination of DNS and WBV (MIX) training modalities on postural stability (PS) in healthy recreation participants. Method and materials: 180 gender-balanced groups were divided into four groups, MIX, DNS, VIBRO and CONTROL and underwent two months of treatment. The single and double-leg Center of Force (COF) parameters were collected on the Forceplate.","Study design The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of dynamic neuromuscular stabilisation (DNS), whole-body vibration (WBV), and a combination of DNS and WBV (MIX) training modalities on postural stability (PS) in healthy recreation participants. The study presents an Interventional study to improve postural stability, and the main objective is prevention. The study model is parallel with four groups.

Participants The randomised, controlled interventional trial enrolled a gender-balanced group of 180 healthy young participants. The initial sample of respondents was recruited through an open online application that lasted two months (from 10.2.2022. to 10.4.2022.) (n=250), after which the first selection of respondents was started (n=230). Recruitment was completed after the optimal sample of subjects was filled (15.4.2022). The study sample was divided using stratified randomisation into the MIX group (n = 58), DNS group (n=57), VIBRO (n=57), and CONTROL group (n=58). At the end of the experimental program, the final sample was 180 (MIX=45; DNS=45; VIBRO=44; CONTROL=43). When stratifying, researchers use proportionate sampling to maintain the correct proportions of genders in every group. After explaining the experimental protocol, each subject provided written informed consent before participating in the study, per the Declaration of Helsinki and the Novi Sad University Human Research Ethics Committee guidelines (ethical approval number: 46-06-04/2020-1). The interventional program was conducted from 25.4.2022. to 25.6.2022. Ethics committee - commission for the implementation of scientific project research.

The exclusion criteria were:

* history of neurological or musculoskeletal disorders;
* clinical conditions that could impair balance (motor disorders, medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, issues with vision, thyroid, nerves, or blood vessels).

The inclusion criteria for this study were:

• the absence of injuries in the past six months and the absence of other medical conditions, including COVID-19, no programmed physical activity in the past three months.

Testing procedures The testing was conducted at the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia. All participants were tested in the morning before their training session in indoor environmental conditions (temperature: 18-21°C; relative humidity: 40-60%). Before starting a performance task, general information about the examinees was recorded, including gender, age, height, and mass. Participants were instructed to wear minimal clothing and remove all footwear for height and mass measurements. In addition, they were required to eat and drink sparingly and void their bladder/excrete as needed before presenting for assessment. A stadiometer (0.1 cm accuracy, SECA Instruments Ltd, Hamburg, Germany) is a secondary outcome for height and mass measurements. Initial testing was conducted on 20.4.2022 and final on 25.6.2022.

Static PS was assessed with a laboratory-grade 0.5 m Footscan® plate (RSscan International, Lammerdries, Belgium) with 4096 sensors and a scanning rate of up to 300 Hz. The subject performed an individual single and double-leg task with three trials, each lasting 30 seconds with a two-minute break between each trial. During the double-leg stance test, participants were instructed to maintain an upright posture as still as possible. They were asked to stand in their natural, comfortable position with their eyes open and fixed on a cross positioned at approximately eye level on a blackboard 5 meters away. Participants stood barefoot with their feet placed shoulder-width apart on a platform, and their arms were kept by their sides. Each participant was required to maintain this stable posture, and measurement started after 10 seconds (preparation period to avoid transient effects). During the single-limb stance test, participants were instructed to balance on one foot. This foot was positioned to point directly forward, aligning with reference lines in the frontal and sagittal planes. The swinging leg was flexed at the hip and knee joints to approximately 90 degrees while both arms hung naturally and relaxed at their sides. Participants were further instructed to maintain as steady a posture as possible, focusing their gaze straight ahead on a point situated 65 centimetres away on the wall. The order of testing between the left and right legs was randomised. Each participant was required to maintain this stable position, and measurement started after 5 seconds (preparation period to avoid transient effects).

Tests for static PS were the gold standard in measuring balance and were used to obtain biomechanical parameters of static PS. All measurements were performed in triplicate, and the mean score was retained for subsequent evaluations and analyses. The sequence of performing the balance tasks was randomised.

The software calculated the single and double-leg Sway Area (cm²), Center of Force (COF) travelled way (mm), Medio-Lateral (ML) displacement (mm), and Anterior-Posterior (AP) displacement (mm) as primary outcomes. As stated in previous research, the following protocol was chosen based on their varying difficulty and everyday use and is cited as reliable.

Interventions Dynamic neuromuscular stabilisation group (DNS) The DNS group's protocol involved 5 min a moderate-intensity warm-up, 40 minutes of DNS movements according to the DNS approach, different diaphragmatic breathing, mobility and controlled movement exercises and 5 minutes of cool-down. Exercises gradually increased in complexity and difﬁculty level regarding DNS training principles. The participants were instructed to refrain from engaging in high-intensity anaerobic or anaerobic resistance training throughout the study period to prevent potential disruptions in the study results.

Whole body vibration group (VIBRO) WBV was performed on the Power Plate Next Generation vibration platform (Power Plate North America, Chicago, IL). All training routines were approximately 50 minutes long, commencing with 5 minutes of moderate-intensity warm-up and concluding with a cool-down period. The program consisted of 8-10 static and dynamic exercises for PS that progressively increased in difficulty and complexity. During the training process, the frequency increased from 20 to 35 Hz in the last week of the experiment; the exercise duration was from 20 - 60 seconds (in the previous week), followed by 1-minute seated rest. Moreover, the complexity and difficulty of exercise increased over the experimental period. The resting period between sets was constant from the start to the end of the training process. During the experiment, the WBV intervention group performed three weekly training sessions. The participants were advised to avoid participating in high-intensity anaerobic or anaerobic resistance training during the study to ensure that it would not interfere with the study's outcomes-no changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced. Principles and basic procedures were adapted from previous research.

Dynamic neuromuscular stabilisation with whole body vibration group (MIX) During the two months, participants in the MIX group performed training consisting of 3 weekly sessions. The protocol consisted of a 50-minute exercise program with a 5-minute moderate-intensity warm-up and cool-down period per training session. The structural core of training included 20 minutes of WBV and 20 minutes of DNS training. Both protocols followed the previous research and training recommendations and were performed with less time and sets. Exercises with VIBRO were performed on the Power Plate Next Generation vibration platform (Power Plate North America, Chicago, IL). The program consisted of 6-8 exercises (static and dynamic) for balance and PS. Exercise progressively increases by the level of difﬁculty. During the training process, the frequency was also increased from 20 to 35 Hz in the last week of the experiment; the duration of exercise from 20 - 60 seconds (in the previous week), followed by 1-minute seated rest. The resting period between sets was constant from the start to the end of the training process. To prevent any interference with the study's results, participants were recommended to abstain from engaging in high-intensity anaerobic or anaerobic resistance training throughout the study. Basic principles and procedures were adapted from previous research. WBV is followed by 20 minutes of DNS training, including specific movement exercises according to the DNS approach accompanied by breathing, coordination, mobility, and stability core exercises and routines suggested in previous studies. During the experiment, the MIX intervention group performed three training sessions weekly.

Control group (CONTROL) The control group did not exercise or use any training intervention or other habitual training during the past two months. During this period, the control group maintained their regular daily routines without any modifications. They refrained from engaging in any form of physical activity or participating in training programs that could influence their fitness levels.

Statistical analyses G\*power 3.1 power analysis software (Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany) estimated the minimum total sample size (N=140) given the critical F(3, 136)=2.67, an effect size f=0.14 (partial η2=0.02), p=0.05, 1-β=0.80, groups=4, time points=2, and correlation among the measurements=0.50. The authors presented data as means and 95% confidence intervals \[95% CIs\]. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Leven's, Box's, and Mauchly's tests confirmed the assumptions of normality, homogeneity of variances and covariances, and sphericity, respectively. General linear models (twelve separate 2x4 mixed-design analyses of covariances for each PS measure) estimated whether mean changes \[95% CIs\] in PS measure from initial to final testing depended on whether participants received the DNS, VIBRO, and MIX exercise program or did not (CONTROL) after controlling for mean-centered BMI. Following the time-by-group interaction effects, which revealed whether estimated changes over time depended on the participants' group (i.e., differed at least between one group-comparison pair), we computed simple effects tests to estimate mean changes over time (mean difference from initial to final testing) within the groups. The follow-up investigation proceeded with contrast analysis, which assessed the degree to which estimated mean changes of PS measures differed between the group-comparison pairs. The authors calculated the effect size for time-by-group interaction effects and simple effects using partial eta squared (partial η2: 0.01 small; 0.06 medium; 0.14 large) and Hedge's g average (Hedge'sav: \<\|0.20\| trivial; \|0.20\| small; \|0.50\| medium; \|0.80\| large), respectively. The Bonferroni test corrected p-values and 95% CI; the alpha level was p≤0.05. We used SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA) to analyse and plot the data, respectively.","Inclusion Criteria:

During the experiment, the MIX intervention group performed three training sessions weekly. Control group (CONTROL) The control group did not exercise or use any training intervention or other habitual training during the past two months. During this period, the control group maintained their regular daily routines without any modifications. They refrained from engaging in any form of physical activity or participating in training programs that could influence their fitness levels. Statistical analyses G\*power 3.1 power analysis software (Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany) estimated the minimum total sample size (N=140) given the critical F(3, 136)=2.67, an effect size f=0.14 (partial η2=0.02), p=0.05, 1-β=0.80, groups=4, time points=2, and correlation among the measurements=0.50. The authors presented data as means and 95% confidence intervals \[95% CIs\]. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Leven's, Box's, and Mauchly's tests confirmed the assumptions of normality, homogeneity of variances and covariances, and sphericity, respectively. General linear models (twelve separate 2x4 mixed-design analyses of covariances for each PS measure) estimated whether mean changes \[95% CIs\] in PS measure from initial to final testing depended on whether participants received the DNS, VIBRO, and MIX exercise program or did not (CONTROL) after controlling for mean-centered BMI. Following the time-by-group interaction effects, which revealed whether estimated changes over time depended on the participants' group (i.e., differed at least between one group-comparison pair), we computed simple effects tests to estimate mean changes over time (mean difference from initial to final testing) within the groups. The follow-up investigation proceeded with contrast analysis, which assessed the degree to which estimated mean changes of PS measures differed between the group-comparison pairs. The authors calculated the effect size for time-by-group interaction effects and simple effects using partial eta squared (partial η2: 0.01 small; 0.06 medium; 0.14 large) and Hedge's g average (Hedge'sav: \<\|0.20\| trivial; \|0.20\| small; \|0.50\| medium; \|0.80\| large), respectively. The Bonferroni test corrected p-values and 95% CI; the alpha level was p≤0.05. We used SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA) to analyse and plot the data, respectively.

The 5-item modified frailty index (mFI-5) is a recent tool used to assess frailty. The aim of the present study was to use the mFI-5 to identify frailty and its association with postoperative adverse outcomes, including mortality and morbidity, among patients who underwent urologic procedures.","Frailty is a clinical condition that often develops with age and is characterized by a decline in physiological capacity and dysfunction across multiple organ systems. This decline results in reduced physical reserve and an increased vulnerability to acute stressors, such as surgical interventions. The prevalence of frailty varies based on the definition used, with 15% of the nonnursing home population in the US experiencing frailty and 45% experiencing prefrailty. Frailty is more common in individuals with certain comorbidities, such as HIV infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and end-stage renal disease, and it is more prevalent with increasing age.

Previous studies have established a link between urologic issues and frailty. In fact, more than 40% of patients with lower urologic symptoms exhibit frailty-related features such as sarcopenia, dysmotility, multimorbidity, and a heightened risk of malnutrition. Additionally, common geriatric ailments, such as benign prostate hypertrophy, dementia, spinal disc herniation, and cerebral infarction, are also associated with neurogenic bladder and other voiding difficulties. Consequently, surgical intervention is often necessary for these populations. However, even minimally invasive procedures may be risky due to the vulnerability of frail individuals. Prior studies have shown a strong correlation between frailty and the likelihood of postoperative mortality and morbidity. Patients classified as very frail have 30-day and 180-day mortality rates of approximately 10% and 40%, respectively, even following minor surgeries.

A new tool for assessing frailty, the 5-item modified frailty index (mFI-5), has recently been developed using data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. This simplified scale, which consists of only five items, has demonstrated superior predictive ability compared to previously utilized tools. The mFI-5 has been studied across various surgical populations and has been found to be associated with unfavorable postoperative outcomes.

Prospective Study,The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the outpatient ambulatory child psychiatric care system on the functioning of anxio-depressive adolescents in school retreat by describing the modalities of individual psychic functioning.,"This research project concerns adolescent patients aged 12 to 17, a period of life towards psychic individualization and autonomy. It is part of an outpatient child psychiatry sector that is concerned with the multidisciplinary and institutional dimension of the care provided. These are part of a long-term patient care dynamic. It is a therapeutic accompaniment of the young person and his entourage, especially parents.

The care is integrative and multidisciplinary (psychiatrist, psychologist, educator, psychomotor, nurse). The care project is done after team discussion, several points are taken into account (clinical evaluation, demand analysis, transfer, study of different psychic movements, family dynamics). The eyes are crossed and the various references (psychodynamic, psychoanalytic, systemic). The family consultations that are always present can be associated with the individual care of the young person, and always link with the analysis of the different institutional movements.

Far Eastern Memorial Hospital,OTHER,NCT05932784,The Impact of Aortic Valve Compression During Cardio-pulmonary Resuscitation on Patients With Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest,The Impact of Aortic Valve Compression During Cardio-pulmonary Resuscitation on Patients With Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Single-center Observational Study Using Transesophageal Echocardiography,"Purpose:

This study aims to find out if the current way of performing chest compressions during resuscitation for patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital is affecting their chances of recovery. Recent research suggests that more than half of these patients receive chest compressions near their aortic valve, which might block blood flow and make their condition worse. We will use a special imaging technique called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during resuscitation to see if compressions near the aortic valve impact patient outcomes.

Methods:

We will conduct a study with patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital and are receiving TEE during resuscitation in the emergency department. Some patients will not be included in the study, such as those who recover quickly before the TEE is done, those who need other treatments before they recover, those with an unclear compression site, or those with poor or missing TEE images. We will divide the patients into two groups: those with compressions near their aortic valve and those without. We will collect information on the patients, the TEE recordings, the resuscitation process, and important time points. We will mainly look at whether the patients recover and maintain a steady heartbeat. We will also examine other factors like their carbon dioxide levels, whether they recover at all, if they survive to be admitted to the hospital, if they survive to be discharged, and if they have good brain function when they leave the hospital. We plan to have 37 patients in each group for accurate results.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of an investigational drug, AZD7325, as a potential treatment for high-functioning adults 18 -35 years old with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The primary study measures are effects on brain waves as measured by non-invasive brain wave recordings (electroencephalograms or EEGs), assessments of side effects, and measures of attention and learning.

The study drug, AZD7325, is manufactured by Astra Zeneca, and was initially tested as a medication for anxiety disorders in over 488 subjects, but was not pursued for marketing due to too few benefits for anxiety. AZD7325 was found to have a very good safety profile and was tolerated by the majority of subjects. AZD7325 has some similar actions to currently marketed anxiety drugs in the benzodiazepine class, but lacks the sedative and negative effects on attention of the benzodiazepines. The study drug is designed to target the GABA neurotransmitter system which is believed to be abnormal in this population.

There are 2 study phases. Phase 1 includes the recruitment of 24 healthy volunteers without mental disorder (6 per site) in order to establish normal EEG reference ranges. Controls will only be seen for one study visit which includes a clinical evaluation, physical exam, routine blood tests, and an EEG. Once control recruitment is complete, Phase 2 will begin.

Phase 2 involves the recruitment of 40 adults (10 per site) 18 - 35 years old with a diagnosis of ASD, normal intelligence, and specific EEG patterns compared to control values. Screening for eligibility will be performed in one visit, which includes a clinical evaluation, tests of learning and intelligence, blood and urine tests, and an EEG. Those subjects who are found to be eligible will be enrolled in a 6-week medication study. Subjects with ASD who are enrolled will be randomly assigned to receive the study drug AZD7325 or placebo in matching capsules. Subjects will be seen weekly by study physicians and clincians for the 7 study visits, including 3 additional EEG recordings, and then for a final follow-up visit (9 total visits including screening lasting up to 11 weeks to complete).

A.O.U. Città della Salute e della Scienza,OTHER,NCT02591602,Teleradiology Program for Frail Patients Living at Home or in Nursing-homes,Teleradiology Program for Frail Patients Living at Home or in Nursing-homes,"Transporting radiology to the patient's home is challenging. Preliminary experiences conducted in Turin (Italy) and Lund (Sweden) indicate that the coupling of simple, light-weight X-ray equipments with a Computed radiography or Digital Radiography systems could be effective for externalization of radiographic service.

The image and examination quality has been proved to be the same than those performed with a stationary equipment and analysis on safety of radio-protection systems show a very low risk exposure for health staff as well as for the general population.

Mobile radiography in nursing homes has shown to be technically feasible and the most beneficial results were that patients avoided unnecessary transport back and forth to the hospital; in both experiences the majority of patients could be treated locally.

The key points of RADHOME project are two:

1. The first one is to built a network model, with the aim to disseminate clinical use of domiciliary radiology.
2. The second one is to demonstrate clinical efficiency and cost-effectiveness of domiciliary radiology.","Europe currently has the highest proportion of older people in the world and is expected to maintain this leading position for the next 50 years.

Population ageing is a great challenge for public health care systems as well as for economic development. As nations age, the prevalence of disability, frailty, and chronic diseases is expected to increase dramatically.

The hospital, which at the moment is the first choice for the delivery of acute medical care, is not an ideal environment for frail, elderly patients. New functional impairment and iatrogenic events such as nosocomial infections, pressure sores, falls and delirium, are common during hospital stay.

With developments in medical and other technologies, people with very complex conditions can increasingly have the possibility to remain at home or in nursing homes rather than in hospital.

Technologies can also improve the quality of life of patients and informal caregivers, allowing people to receive care and remain active at home and in the community, instead of being institutionalized.

These societal changes, such as needs of health care cost reduction and an aging population, are the main driving force for the development of telemedicine, especially for elderly patients.

Residents in nursing homes or patients treated at home by community care services are usually old or very old, multimorbid and often cognitively impaired. For these patients transportation to the hospital for X-ray examinations may be an exhausting and disorienting experience. They are collected by an ambulance or taxi and taken away from their environment and people they know. Patients wait in hospital corridors to have a fairly simple X-ray done and then wait for the pickup.

The first objective of RADHOME is to move equipments instead of patients in order to give a response to the geriatric tsunami and to the demand for more flexible health services, providing a view to advancing the economic efficiency of this service.

Teleradiology has become an essential part of the practice of radiology, with broad implications for care delivery and the organization of work: combining teleradiology and domiciliary X-ray examination has the potential to greatly improve the quality of care for elderly frail patients with acute or chronic conditions.

Until now no wide randomized study on radiology at home has been published. Hence main aim of this project is to carefully analyze feasibility, safety and cost-effectiveness of a public, extra-hospital and domiciliary radiology service for frail elderly or immobile patients, more vulnerable to environmental and social changes than other groups of patients, which health conditions discourage the transportation to hospital.","Inclusion Criteria:

Preliminary experiences conducted in Turin (Italy) and Lund (Sweden) indicate that the coupling of simple, light-weight X-ray equipments with a Computed radiography or Digital Radiography systems could be effective for externalization of radiographic service. The image and examination quality has been proved to be the same than those performed with a stationary equipment and analysis on safety of radio-protection systems show a very low risk exposure for health staff as well as for the general population. Mobile radiography in nursing homes has shown to be technically feasible and the most beneficial results were that patients avoided unnecessary transport back and forth to the hospital; in both experiences the majority of patients could be treated locally. The key points of RADHOME project are two: 1. The first one is to built a network model, with the aim to disseminate clinical use of domiciliary radiology. 2. The second one is to demonstrate clinical efficiency and cost-effectiveness of domiciliary radiology. Europe currently has the highest proportion of older people in the world and is expected to maintain this leading position for the next 50 years. Population ageing is a great challenge for public health care systems as well as for economic development. As nations age, the prevalence of disability, frailty, and chronic diseases is expected to increase dramatically. The hospital, which at the moment is the first choice for the delivery of acute medical care, is not an ideal environment for frail, elderly patients. New functional impairment and iatrogenic events such as nosocomial infections, pressure sores, falls and delirium, are common during hospital stay. With developments in medical and other technologies, people with very complex conditions can increasingly have the possibility to remain at home or in nursing homes rather than in hospital. Technologies can also improve the quality of life of patients and informal caregivers, allowing people to receive care and remain active at home and in the community, instead of being institutionalized. These societal changes, such as needs of health care cost reduction and an aging population, are the main driving force for the development of telemedicine, especially for elderly patients. Residents in nursing homes or patients treated at home by community care services are usually old or very old, multimorbid and often cognitively impaired. For these patients transportation to the hospital for X-ray examinations may be an exhausting and disorienting experience. They are collected by an ambulance or taxi and taken away from their environment and people they know. Patients wait in hospital corridors to have a fairly simple X-ray done and then wait for the pickup. The first objective of RADHOME is to move equipments instead of patients in order to give a response to the geriatric tsunami and to the demand for more flexible health services, providing a view to advancing the economic efficiency of this service. Teleradiology has become an essential part of the practice of radiology, with broad implications for care delivery and the organization of work: combining teleradiology and domiciliary X-ray examination has the potential to greatly improve the quality of care for elderly frail patients with acute or chronic conditions. Until now no wide randomized study on radiology at home has been published. Hence main aim of this project is to carefully analyze feasibility, safety and cost-effectiveness of a public, extra-hospital and domiciliary radiology service for frail elderly or immobile patients, more vulnerable to environmental and social changes than other groups of patients, which health conditions discourage the transportation to hospital.

National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),NIH,NCT00029302,Brain Control of Bimanual (Both Hands) Movements,Brain Areas Involved in Temporal Linkage of Bilateral Movements,"This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate how the brain controls bimanual movements (movements of both hands).

Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study.

Participants will have a medical history, physical and neurological examinations, and will complete a questionnaire before and after testing. The study consists of two parts: 1) finger movement training and 2) magnetic resonance imaging, as follows:

Part 1 - Finger movement training

Participants will train to do three different finger movements using the index finger of both hands. The fingers will be taped to a device that measures their movement. The movements are:

* Lifting and dropping the index fingers of each hand repetitively and in synchrony (starting and stopping at the same time). The amplitude of finger movements is the same for both hands.
* Lifting and dropping the index fingers of each hand repetitively and in synchrony, but with a different amplitude for each hand.
* Lifting and dropping of the index finger of each hand repetitively, but each with a different amplitude and not in synchrony.

Part 2 - Magnetic resonance imaging

Participants will perform the trained movements during MRI scanning. This diagnostic procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of brain structure and activity. For MRI, the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner-a cylinder containing a strong magnet. Earplugs are worn to protect the ears from loud thumping noises that occur with electrical switching of radio frequency circuits. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 2 hours, with most examinations lasting 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The subject can communicate with the staff person conducting the test at all times during the scan.","OBJECTIVE: The present study is aimed to clarify which structure or network of structures are responsible for the temporal linkage in bimanual co-ordination in healthy humans.

STUDY POPULATION: Healthy normal volunteers.

DESIGN:

fMRI: Anatomical MRI and fMRI sequences are performed to obtain blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging of brain activation during which movement performance will be measured with respect to movement synchrony, movement speed and amplitude.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,NETWORK,NCT00052884,Amifostine and Melphalan in Treating Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis Who Are Undergoing Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation,A Phase I Study of Amifostine Followed by High-Dose Escalation of Melphalan With Stem Cell Reconstitution for Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis,"RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of plasma cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Having a peripheral stem cell transplant to replace the blood-forming cells destroyed by chemotherapy, allows higher dose of chemotherapy to be given so that more plasma cells are killed. Giving a chemoprotective drug such as amifostine may protect kidney cells from the side effects of chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of melphalan given together with amifostine in treating patients who are undergoing peripheral stem cell transplant for primary systemic amyloidosis.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of high-dose melphalan administered with amifostine in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
* Determine the toxicity of high-dose melphalan when administered at the MTD in these patients.
* Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of melphalan.

Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily until peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection is complete. Apheresis begins on day 5 of G-CSF administration and continues until the target number of PBSCs are collected.

Within 6 weeks of PBSC collection, patients receive amifostine IV over 5 minutes on days -2 and -1 and high-dose melphalan IV over 30-60 minutes on day -1. Patients undergo autologous PBSC infusion on day 0.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10 patients are treated at that dose.

Patients are followed approximately 3 months following transplantation, then every 6 months for 5 years.

The University of Hong Kong,OTHER,NCT01891084,The Benefit and Harm of Fever Suppression by Antipyretics in Influenza,A Randomized Controlled Trial on the Effect of Fever Suppression by Antipyretics on Influenza,The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential benefits and risks of antipyretics use in naturally occurring influenza virus infections in humans.,"Background:

Being one of the commonest conditions encountered in modern medical practice, fever is commonly regarded as an illness that has to be treated, both by medical professionals and patients. However, objective and convincing evidence is lacking that naturally occurring fever is harmful, and there is growing evidence that fever may serve an important host defense mechanism in infections and the risks of its suppression may far outweigh its apparent benefits. In acute respiratory infections including influenza, antipyretics are commonly being prescribed as a symptomatic treatment. Evidence from different randomized controlled trials, however, had challenged the actual amount of clinical benefit achievable by fever suppression for improving the patients' comfort and behavior. On the other hand, evidence from animal and human challenge studies has suggested that antipyretic therapy may actually prolong the duration of illness, suppress humoral antibody response, and increase the level and duration of viral shedding.

The knowledge gap:

Most of the currently available evidence on the harms and benefits of antipyretic treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are from either experimental animal studies, or human challenge studies with various respiratory viruses, or from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on patients with fever of presumed viral origin. There has yet been no RCT that has investigated on the effect of antipyretics on the clinical course, disease duration, and the pattern of viral shedding in naturally occurring acute URTIs of viral origin in humans. Whereas acute URTIs can be caused by a range of viral and non-viral causes, influenza virus infection is one of its leading cause, and its pathogenesis is relatively well understood compared to some other respiratory viruses.

Aim:

To investigate the potential benefits and risks of antipyretic use in naturally occurring influenza virus infections in humans.

Design and subjects:

The study is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Four hundred young adults aged 18-30 years will be recruited when they present with symptoms of acute respiratory infection within 48 hours of symptoms onset to university health clinics, and being tested positive with a QuickVue rapid influenza test. They will receive their clinical consultation and prescriptions as indicated as usual, and being randomized to receive either paracetamol or placebo, and given back-up NSAID for intolerable fever when required. Blood specimen, nasal and throat swabs will be collected on the same day (day 1). They will be followed-up on day 4, day 7 and day 10 for further collection of nasal and throat swabs, and on day 28 for a final blood taking. A symptom diary will be kept by each participant for 10 days for monitoring the clinical course of the infection.

Potential significance:

This will be the first RCT to investigate the effect of antipyretics on the clinical course, disease duration, and the pattern of viral shedding in naturally occurring influenza virus infection in humans. Findings from this study will have important contribution to our understanding on the role of fever as a host defense mechanism, and help to inform the appropriate clinical management approach in human influenza virus infection.","Inclusion Criteria:

University of Pittsburgh,OTHER,NCT05724784,Development and Feasibility Testing of a Suicide Prevention Intervention for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth,Development and Feasibility Testing of a Suicide Prevention Intervention for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth,"This study aims to develop and test a brief, digital, suicide prevention intervention for sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth who have experienced cyberbullying. Leading up to this phase, the study team completed two prior study aims, focused on identifying perspectives of SGM youth's regarding their experiences with cyberbullying and priorities for an intervention, and a phase in which SGM youth codesigned the study's intervention with the study team. This resulted in the development of study's intervention, Flourish, which leverages a text messaging-based chatbot to reduce suicide risk following cyberbullying among SGM youth through improving distress tolerance, motivation for help-seeking, and social problem-solving.

Current Study Aim:

Conduct an open trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Flourish among cyberbullied SGM youth, ages 12-17 (N=10).

Hypotheses:

Feasibility will be evidenced by recruitment/retention rates \> 80% and use of Flourish among \> 70% of SGM youth.

At follow-up, adolescents will report improved problem-solving capacity, distress tolerance, and motivation for help-seeking and reduced psychological distress and suicidal ideation compared to baseline.","FLOURISH:

Flourish is a chatbot that will aim to improve adolescents' capacity to cope following cyberbullying and reduce their suicidal risk. The duration of Flourish is 4 weeks. Flourish is designed to be self-paced with branching logic, aiming to provide the right type of support at the right time youth need it. Therefore, the frequency with which youth interact with Flourish will differ from person to person. However, participants are expected to interact with Flourish no less than 2-3 times per week.

Onboarding. Prior to initiating Flourish, adolescents and their caregivers will participate in a session of approximately 30 minutes with a study clinician in which they will onboard to Flourish. During onboarding, the clinician will orient the adolescent to Flourish and load information onto Flourish that will be available to the adolescent throughout their use of the intervention. This will include personal crisis contacts, such as trusted adults and crisis hotlines they could contact in the event of a crisis, as well as contacts for people they could reach out to for support or distraction outside of a crisis situation, such as a close friend or a family member. Adolescents will additionally enter information to personalize their experience with Flourish, such as entering preferences for coping skills that work best for them. During the onboarding process, caregivers will be provided with resources to respond to cyberbullying s as well as information on their child's personal crisis resources.

Launch. The research team will administer brief questionnaires to adolescents 2-3 times per week during the 4-week intervention period that assess positive/supportive and negative/bullying interactions on social media. If adolescents indicate negative interactions, Flourish will automatically launch. If adolescents indicate supportive interactions (or no interactions), they will be given the option to launch Flourish to practice their coping skills, so they are prepared to respond to future cyberbullying events.

Resource Website:

Participants receiving Flourish will also have access to an accompanying website. The website will not collect or store any private information from the participant, and the participant will not interact with the website. It is a publicly available website that provides a list of resources participants may use, if needed. For example, this will include SGM mental health organizations and organizations that provide education, support, and advocacy for youth who have experienced cyberbullying.

Treatment Targets:

To reduce psychological distress and suicidal ideation, Flourish will deploy distress tolerance skills and utilize principles of problem-solving therapy and motivational interviewing.

Problem-Solving. Problem-solving therapy (PST) is a brief cognitive-behavioral intervention that aims to improve coping with stressful life events. PST has shown efficacy in reducing suicide risk among youth and has been successfully delivered in a self-guided online format. Flourish will target: problem identification by aiding youth in appraising the threat of the cyberbullying event they experienced and their socioemotional consequences, generation of potential solutions based on available resources for response, and decision-making through considering barriers and facilitators to putting solutions into action.

Motivation. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a patient-centered approach that provides a framework for enhancing intrinsic motivation for change that has shown efficacy for improving help-seeking among youth at suicidal risk and has been used in digital mental health interventions. Flourish will incorporate the spirit of MI through its clinical style (i.e., collaborative, empowering language) and MI techniques through responses that are affirming, reflections to demonstrate the chatbot is listening, and offer simple summaries to evoke a change mindset. Flourish will engage strategies to support self-efficacy by focusing on confidence in help-seeking. Through a library of messages, refined to assure fidelity with MI principles, Flourish will elicit thoughts about seeking help following cyberbullying, assess readiness for behavior change through rulers that assess importance and confidence in change, and make a plan for help-seeking. Youth will be offered individualized feedback through stories of SGM adolescents' help-seeking experiences. Developed by writers in partnership with SGM youth, stories will target key motivational barriers to help-seeking following cyberbullying identified in the investigators' pilot data: trust, confidentiality, fear of negative appraisal, and disbelief that help will be effective. Stories will be tailored, i.e., offering examples for youth of differing ages, genders, and identities, and will consider experiences specific to SGM youth of color.

Distress Tolerance. Flourish will be designed to support adolescents' tolerance of distress in recognition that sustained distress experiences contribute to suicidal ideation and interfere with adaptive problem-solving. Flourish will lead youth in monitoring distress levels and respond with a coping skills library that leverages existing online content, focusing on distraction and self-soothing (e.g., guided meditation, breathing exercises, and savoring positive memories).","Inclusion Criteria:

During onboarding, the clinician will orient the adolescent to Flourish and load information onto Flourish that will be available to the adolescent throughout their use of the intervention. This will include personal crisis contacts, such as trusted adults and crisis hotlines they could contact in the event of a crisis, as well as contacts for people they could reach out to for support or distraction outside of a crisis situation, such as a close friend or a family member. Adolescents will additionally enter information to personalize their experience with Flourish, such as entering preferences for coping skills that work best for them. During the onboarding process, caregivers will be provided with resources to respond to cyberbullying s as well as information on their child's personal crisis resources. Launch. The research team will administer brief questionnaires to adolescents 2-3 times per week during the 4-week intervention period that assess positive/supportive and negative/bullying interactions on social media. If adolescents indicate negative interactions, Flourish will automatically launch. If adolescents indicate supportive interactions (or no interactions), they will be given the option to launch Flourish to practice their coping skills, so they are prepared to respond to future cyberbullying events. Resource Website: Participants receiving Flourish will also have access to an accompanying website. The website will not collect or store any private information from the participant, and the participant will not interact with the website. It is a publicly available website that provides a list of resources participants may use, if needed. For example, this will include SGM mental health organizations and organizations that provide education, support, and advocacy for youth who have experienced cyberbullying. Treatment Targets: To reduce psychological distress and suicidal ideation, Flourish will deploy distress tolerance skills and utilize principles of problem-solving therapy and motivational interviewing. Problem-Solving. Problem-solving therapy (PST) is a brief cognitive-behavioral intervention that aims to improve coping with stressful life events. PST has shown efficacy in reducing suicide risk among youth and has been successfully delivered in a self-guided online format. Flourish will target: problem identification by aiding youth in appraising the threat of the cyberbullying event they experienced and their socioemotional consequences, generation of potential solutions based on available resources for response, and decision-making through considering barriers and facilitators to putting solutions into action. Motivation. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a patient-centered approach that provides a framework for enhancing intrinsic motivation for change that has shown efficacy for improving help-seeking among youth at suicidal risk and has been used in digital mental health interventions. Flourish will incorporate the spirit of MI through its clinical style (i.e., collaborative, empowering language) and MI techniques through responses that are affirming, reflections to demonstrate the chatbot is listening, and offer simple summaries to evoke a change mindset. Flourish will engage strategies to support self-efficacy by focusing on confidence in help-seeking. Through a library of messages, refined to assure fidelity with MI principles, Flourish will elicit thoughts about seeking help following cyberbullying, assess readiness for behavior change through rulers that assess importance and confidence in change, and make a plan for help-seeking. Youth will be offered individualized feedback through stories of SGM adolescents' help-seeking experiences. Developed by writers in partnership with SGM youth, stories will target key motivational barriers to help-seeking following cyberbullying identified in the investigators' pilot data: trust, confidentiality, fear of negative appraisal, and disbelief that help will be effective. Stories will be tailored, i.e., offering examples for youth of differing ages, genders, and identities, and will consider experiences specific to SGM youth of color. Distress Tolerance. Flourish will be designed to support adolescents' tolerance of distress in recognition that sustained distress experiences contribute to suicidal ideation and interfere with adaptive problem-solving. Flourish will lead youth in monitoring distress levels and respond with a coping skills library that leverages existing online content, focusing on distraction and self-soothing (e.g., guided meditation, breathing exercises, and savoring positive memories). Inclusion Criteria: * self-reported SGM identity * English-speaking * access to a phone or device to complete the study's intervention * past-month history of cyberbullying or online discrimination, assessed by the cybervictimization subscale of the traditional and cyberbullying victimization and perpetration scale or a discrimination measure developed as part of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study * lifetime history of suicidal ideation or behavior (assessed by the Ask Suicide Screen) Exclusion Criteria: * intellectual challenges, low literacy levels, or other conditions that might inhibit adolescents' ability to effectively engage with Flourish (reported by parents and, if needed, confirmed through the age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence scale) * acuity levels suggesting need for a higher level of care (e.g., inpatient hospitalization) or referral for emergency services"

* To assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of YF476 in healthy volunteers.
* To select a dose or doses of YF476 for detailed pharmacodynamic studies in healthy volunteers.","YF476 is clearly a potent and selective gastrin/CCK-B antagonist and should inhibit basal and meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and enhance gastric emptying of a liquid meal in man. Therefore YF476 might benefit patients with reflux oesophagitis. The compound has been remarkably well tolerated in animal toxicity studies at doses well in excess of the projected therapeutic dose in patients, and merits first administration to healthy volunteers. That study using the oral route of administration is described here. Extrapolation from data obtained with pentagastrin in animals suggest that single doses of less than 1mg of YF476 should be active in man. However, extrapolation from data obtained in comparative studies with the H2-antagonists and with omeprazole in animals suggest that the therapeutic dose in patients with reflux oesophagitis will be larger, in the region of 10mg. A range of single doses will be used in this study. The maximum dose will be 10 times more than the expected therapeutic dose.","Inclusion Criteria:

YF476 is clearly a potent and selective gastrin/CCK-B antagonist and should inhibit basal and meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and enhance gastric emptying of a liquid meal in man. Therefore YF476 might benefit patients with reflux oesophagitis. The compound has been remarkably well tolerated in animal toxicity studies at doses well in excess of the projected therapeutic dose in patients, and merits first administration to healthy volunteers. That study using the oral route of administration is described here. Extrapolation from data obtained with pentagastrin in animals suggest that single doses of less than 1mg of YF476 should be active in man. However, extrapolation from data obtained in comparative studies with the H2-antagonists and with omeprazole in animals suggest that the therapeutic dose in patients with reflux oesophagitis will be larger, in the region of 10mg. A range of single doses will be used in this study. The maximum dose will be 10 times more than the expected therapeutic dose.

Yet the most effective location and parameters for treatment need more exploration. Also, whether rTMS is an effective treatment for individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) has not been empirically tested. The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate whether fMRI guided rTMS is effective in reducing symptoms of GAD.","This study utilized a 3-week open-label design to evaluate the efficacy of fMRI guided rTMS in the treatment of GAD.

We first used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the gambling task to localize anxiety-related brain activations in each individual participant, and then used this information to guide treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

TMS was delivered to the target site at a frequency of 1 Hz for 20 minutes (900 total pulses). The intensity of the TMS was set to 90% of the passive motor threshold for each participant.

The primary efficacy measures include the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS).

Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation,OTHER,NCT04754984,Postpartum Pelvic Floor Workshop,A Randomized Trial: Can a Postpartum Pelvic Floor Education Workshop in a High-Risk Population Improve Pelvic Floor Symptoms?,"After having a baby, there are some expected changes in pelvic floor function. However, tearing of the pelvic floor, having a large baby and needing a vacuum or forceps to deliver the baby put women at risk for having pelvic floor disorders. Our study aims to see if, in women who had a high risk for pelvic floor disorders, a pelvic floor education workshop four weeks after delivery can improve pelvic floor disorders compared to those that did not have a workshop.","There is compelling evidence for the need for perineal education and care, especially in women who have recognized risk factors. For example, 30-50% of women who have a clinically recognized risk factor report anal incontinence, fecal urgency, dyspareunia and perineal pain. Despite this, a study found that less than 50% of women with anal incontinence voice those symptoms unless directly asked about them.

Some authors discuss how women may not share these symptoms with their care providers out of the belief that it is a ""normal"" effect of childbirth. A review of the literature shows that antenatal educational workshops can be an effective means to provide pregnant women with information regarding pelvic floor health, including how modes of delivery impact pelvic floor function. Similarly, antenatal pelvic floor workshops have been found to improve patients' knowledge on pelvic floor health, their practice of pelvic floor muscle exercises and their confidence with these exercises.

To our knowledge, there is no literature exploring the role of a postpartum pelvic floor workshop, on managing perineal and pelvic floor symptoms in women who are identified as being at higher risk of developing pelvic floor dysfunction. Our goal is to develop and assess such a workshop.","Inclusion Criteria:

After having a baby, there are some expected changes in pelvic floor function. However, tearing of the pelvic floor, having a large baby and needing a vacuum or forceps to deliver the baby put women at risk for having pelvic floor disorders. Our study aims to see if, in women who had a high risk for pelvic floor disorders, a pelvic floor education workshop four weeks after delivery can improve pelvic floor disorders compared to those that did not have a workshop. There is compelling evidence for the need for perineal education and care, especially in women who have recognized risk factors. For example, 30-50% of women who have a clinically recognized risk factor report anal incontinence, fecal urgency, dyspareunia and perineal pain. Despite this, a study found that less than 50% of women with anal incontinence voice those symptoms unless directly asked about them. Some authors discuss how women may not share these symptoms with their care providers out of the belief that it is a ""normal"" effect of childbirth. A review of the literature shows that antenatal educational workshops can be an effective means to provide pregnant women with information regarding pelvic floor health, including how modes of delivery impact pelvic floor function. Similarly, antenatal pelvic floor workshops have been found to improve patients' knowledge on pelvic floor health, their practice of pelvic floor muscle exercises and their confidence with these exercises. To our knowledge, there is no literature exploring the role of a postpartum pelvic floor workshop, on managing perineal and pelvic floor symptoms in women who are identified as being at higher risk of developing pelvic floor dysfunction. Our goal is to develop and assess such a workshop.

Ege University,OTHER,NCT04099602,The Effect of Massage on Bilirubin Level in Infants,Investigation of the Effect of Massage on Bilirubin Level in Preterm Infants,"Jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia) which is one of the common causes of repeated hospitalizations in the neonatal period, is a physiological condition seen in 60% of term babies and 80% of premature babies in the first week of life . Premature babies are more susceptible tobilirubin neurotoxicity. Death and severe sequelae due to hyperbilirubinemia can be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. Massage is one of the applications that can be used to reduce bilirubin levels in newborn infants. Baby massage facilitates bowel movements and bilirubin excretion by reducing enterohepatic circulation. This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of massage on bilirubin levels in premature infants.","Neonatal jaundice is a physiological condition seen in 60% of infants and 80% of preterm infants in the first week of life. There is no clear data on the frequency of jaundice in newborns in our country. Jaundice is one of the common causes of 75% of hospitalizations in the first week after birth and the recurrence of hospitalizations in the neonatal period. Neonatal jaundice is a non-hazardous and transient condition that can usually resolve spontaneously without treatment. Although it is a transient condition, high bilirubin levels can cause kernicterus which causes severe neurological damage if not diagnosed and treated early .

The severity and complications of hyperbilirubinemia in premature infants are different from term infants. Premature infants are more susceptible to damage caused by serum bilirubin, even at low levels of brain cells. Hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants is more prevalent, severe, and protracted than that in term infants because of the immaturity of their red blood cells, livers, and gastrointestinal tracts. There also is often a delay in enteral feeds, which may limit intestinal flow and bacterial colonization, resulting in further enhancement of the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Preterm neonates are more susceptible to bilirubin neurotoxicity. Almost all preterm infants less than 35 weeks gestational age have elevated total serum/plasma bilirubin levels, which results in neonatal jaundice, the yellowish discoloration of the skin and conjunctiva caused by bilirubin deposition. The major complication of an elevated total serum (hyperbilirubinemia) is bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND), which occurs when circulating bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to brain tissue . Jaundice is an important problem in newborn infants and death and severe sequelae due to hyperbilirubinemia can be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. Various treatment methods have been developed to reduce bilirubin levels. The most commonly used methods are; blood exchange, phototherapy and pharmacological agents. Therapeutic interventions prevent BIND and thus kernicterus by lowering the level of bilirubin in the blood. Phototherapy is a common treatment for both treatment and prevention of increased bilirubin levels. Phototherapy has been widely used in the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia of the newborn for more than fifty years. Phototherapy has various side effects, such as damage to the retina and genitalia, loss of body water, skin rashes, watery stools and Bronze Baby Syndrome.

Nowadays, studies on new treatment methods and different applications are being made which support the treatment of jaundice and shorten the length of hospital stay. Kangaroo care reduces the exposure of newborns to phototherapy, swimming, wiping and bathtub bathing have been reported to reduce bilirubin levels. Baby massage is one of the alternative and complementary therapies that can be used to reduce bilirubin levels.

While there are many studies investigating the effect of infant massage on bilirubin levels in term neonates with healthy and hyperbilirubinemia, a limited number of studies investigating the effect of massage on bilirubin levels in premature infants were found.

It is suggested that baby massage can be performed by trained nurses and mothers trained by nurses. Infant massage stimulates defecation by increasing bowel movements, thus decreasing enterohepatic circulation and increasing bilirubin excretion. Bilirubin excretion decreases the speed and severity of hyperbilirubinemia. In some studies investigating the effect of massage on bilirubin levels, transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) levels or TSB levels were found to be significantly lower, also no significant difference was found in some studies.

In our country, the studies on the benefits of baby massage for infants are quite new. There are two studies investigating the effect of massage on bilirubin levels in newborn infants. However, in one of these studies, the effect of infant massage on bilirubin levels in newborns who received phototherapy was investigated, while the effect of abdominal massage on TcB bilirubin levels in newborns was investigated in the other study. TSB levels are the gold standard in the evaluation of bilirubin levels in newborn infants. However, the blood needs to be taken from the baby, and taking blood is a painful procedure, and it may not always possible to get enough blood. Measurement of bilirubin level from the skin surface is both noninvasive, painless and simple. In this study, the effect of infant massage on bilirubin level in premature infants not receiving phototherapy was evaluated by transcutaneous bilirubin measurement method.

University of Melbourne,OTHER,NCT02629484,Trial of Focused Cardiac Ultrasound for Fractured Neck of Femur Surgery,"A Pilot Study to Assess Feasibility, Compliance, Safety and Group Separation for a Multicentre Randomised Trial of Preoperative Focused Cardiac Ultrasound for Fractured Neck of Femur Surgery","Hip fracture surgery is a major world health care burden and concern, as it has a large and increasing prevalence and carries very high patient mortality, disability and community health care cost. As the commonest cause of mortality is from cardiac complications, and cardiac disease is prevalent and frequently missed by standard care, we hypothesise that earlier and more accurate diagnosis and treatment of cardiac pathology in this cohort will lead to improved outcome. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) is a new increasingly popular technique used by doctors that enables earlier and more accurate diagnosis of cardiac disorders that can be performed routinely before hip fracture surgery. Our preliminary data of 64 patients demonstrated that routine FCU before surgery lead to a change in cardiac diagnosis and management in 50% of patients requiring hip fracture surgery, which was associated with a 50% reduction in mortality 12 months after surgery compared with controls. It is therefore important for a large randomised trial to be performed to confirm or rebuke these findings, as if true, would have a very large impact on health care and may also improve health care and outcome in other high-risk surgical populations. The proposed pilot study is a pilot study which aims to establish feasibility, safety, compliance and group separation prior to commencing a definitive multicentre trial.","Aims and Hypotheses Aims

1. To determine whether routine preoperative focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) leads to a reduced composite outcome of death, major adverse cardiac events, and acute renal failure (adverse composite outcome) 30 days after hip fracture surgery compared to patients who do not receive preoperative FCU (current standard of care).
2. To identify the changes in team management of the patient due to FCU that are associated with improved outcome, compared to current standard of care.
3. To determine whether routine preoperative FCU is more cost-effective than current standard of care.

Hypotheses

1. FCU reduces adverse composite outcome by at least 20%, 30 days after hip fracture surgery.
2. FCU leads to changes in cardiac diagnosis, and subsequent changes to perioperative and post-discharge management plans, which are associated with improved outcome compared to current standard of care.
3. Routine FCU before hip fracture surgery is more cost-effective than current standard of care.

Identifying cardiovascular disease: Preoperative cardiac assessment, which enables improved cardiac treatment and reduction of cardiac complications, is recommended by the American Heart Association. However, cardiovascular disease is often unrecognised and under-diagnosed in this age group because of frailty, general immobility, and the high frequency of poor cognitive function including dementia, which inhibits accurate clinical assessment. Careful cardiac assessment and treatment is often not undertaken because of the belief that surgery should be performed urgently and a delay for cardiac investigations may worsen outcome.

Cardiac risk factors for death after hip fracture surgery (cardiac failure, aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy) cannot be reliably diagnosed with clinical examination and require echocardiography (FCU or transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)). Although a pulmonary embolus cannot be reliably diagnosed with echocardiography, the haemodynamic effects from a significant pulmonary embolus are readily seen (right ventricular dilatation and failure). Currently, preoperative TTE is only used in selected patients, based on the clinical assessment and the opinion of the clinician as to whether it is justified. If the anaesthetist reviews the patient just prior to surgery and is concerned about cardiovascular disease, there is a lot of pressure to proceed with booked surgery due to the current belief that early surgery saves lives, rather than to delay surgery for a TTE. Treatment is therefore often based on ""best guess"" clinical assessment. This management approach may lead to inadequate treatment with resultant hypotension, leading to organ failure and death.

Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FCU): The conventional TTE investigation is ordered by the treating doctor, performed by a technician and reported by a cardiologist or radiologist at a later time. The TTE provides detailed information on structure and function of all of the valves and chambers and is also referred to as diagnostic echocardiography. A TTE or other complex cardiovascular investigation leads to delay, as the process of obtaining a TTE and then waiting for the report may take days depending on resource availability. Any echocardiography examination is a ""snapshot"" in time, and heart function can change between the performance of the TTE and the commencement of surgery. A FCU utilises the same echocardiography techniques as conventional TTE but is performed as a bedside test by the treating doctor to answer a clinical question to aid clinical decision-making in real time. It provides specific information relevant to perioperative care in time for acute resuscitation and potentially life-saving decision-making.

A type of FCU, iHeartScanTM , that is specifically designed for critical and perioperative care has been developed by the Ultrasound Education Group at The University of Melbourne. FCU has been confirmed to be as accurate as comprehensive TTE for purposes of acute clinical care. FCU has been endorsed by The American Society of Echocardiography and embraced by the critical care community.

The case for equipoise: The conventional approach to proceed to early surgery without delay for cardiovascular investigations is contrary to the proof-of-concept data that preoperative FCU may reduce mortality through the provision of better cardiovascular diagnostic information, leading to management changes. The use of conventional TTE, however, causes considerable delay to surgery, which may increase mortality risk. FCU has the advantage of providing improved diagnosis without causing substantial delay to surgery, and can therefore is additive to rather than competitive with current ""best practice"". An economic analysis of routine FCU has not been performed.

Feasibility of the trial - the ECHONOF II trial In the preliminary study, feasibility of routine FCU in hip fracture surgery was demonstrated, with more than one patient per week at one centre. To determine feasibility of the proposed outcome randomised controlled trial (RCT) a pilot study of feasibility, safety, protocol compliance and group separation will be conducted in 2016 at 4-5 sites across Australia, with the lead site at Royal Melbourne Hospital. The pilot study analysis will include patients recruited who have 30-day data available a in 2016, though data will continue to be collected out to 12 months.

The pilot study protocol will be the same as the proposed (future) definitive clinical trial , but the endpoints are aimed at assessing feasibility and compliance.

Research protocol Trial Design: A parallel group, randomised controlled, multicentre trial with 1:1 allocation ratio.

Participants: Patients presenting with isolated, primary, non-metastatic fractured neck of femur, where surgery is expected within 48 hours after hospital admission will be recruited. Patients with prior hip surgery on the affected side, or where the cause is likely to be due to metastatic cancer, or where survival is unlikely in the 24 hours from admission will not be included.

Settings and Locations: teaching and regional hospitals in Australia with a high volume of hip fracture surgery and the necessary equipment and expertise to perform FCU have agreed to participate.

Intervention: Participants randomised to the FCU group will receive a preoperative FCU performed by an independent operator within 24 hours of planned surgery, following The University of Melbourne iHeartScanTM protocol. Patients randomised to the standard care group will not undergo FCU before surgery.

There are no restrictions on the treating team in either group determining what management they will employ, including anaesthesia technique, surgical management, perioperative care and preoperative investigations including comprehensive TTE by the cardiology department. However the treatment of patients will be recorded, allowing comparison of the effect of FCU on diagnosis and management between groups.

The control group will represent the standard of care in each of the participating hospitals. This typically includes early surgery with minimal preoperative investigations. Some patients, however, based on the clinical assessment of their treating doctors, will have additional investigations such as comprehensive TTE, which could result in changes in management including an associated delay in surgery. This trial will not interfere with the standard of care management, and, once recruited, patients will remain in the standard of care group even if they receive comprehensive TTE or have delayed surgery. Treatment in both groups will be according to individual and institutional practice, working with the diagnostic information available at the time.

Randomisation: Randomisation codes will be in blocks using a web-based automatic enrolment system to participating institutions in order to facilitate recruitment across different time zones and out-of-hours cases. Patients will be stratified to severity of surgery (hip replacement/hemiarthroplasty, or femoral fixation) and institution (tertiary referral, or non-tertiary metropolitan/ regional hospitals). The randomisation sequence will be generated using a computer random sequence generator for each strata in blocks of 10 to ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at any one time during the trial.

Allocation concealment and implementation: The allocation sequence will be concealed by the web-based enrolment system. The site research staff will recruit patients and organise an in dependent practitioner to perform FCU (or not). The independent practitioner will receive the allocation and whether to perform FCU or not, and place the completed or blank FCU form in a sealed envelope. The treating doctors will first complete a management plan before opening the envelope to obtain the completed or blank FCU form. The FCU form will then be placed in a second sealed envelope which is not opened until the allocation sequence is revealed. The research staff who will collect outcome data are not involved in patient recruitment and will therefore be blinded to group allocation. The central trial monitor who adjudicates outcomes with the assistance of 2 clinicians are also blinded to allocation.

Statistical methods: The Statistical Consulting Group (University of Melbourne), supervised by team statistician Dr Sandy Clarke,will advise and supervise statistical methods, data management, integrity, security and analysis. The primary outcome will be compared between FCU and control groups using binary logistic regression, with the control group as the reference category. The survival times will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A pre-determined sub-group analysis will separate those with and without an existing TTE in the previous 12 months. Relative risk of death will be analysed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Patterns of management and relative risk (of death) will be compared between groups using a two-sample t-test including sub-group analysis of pathology identified by FCU (e.g., hypovolaemia, cardiac failure and aortic stenosis).

Clinical trial coordination: The trial will be managed through the Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne. This will include all aspects of trial control, data collation, and site co-ordination. An independent committee including a statistician, clinical trial monitor, clinician, and member of the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee will oversee trial safety and data integrity. The committee will perform a planned, blinded interim analysis, after 50% recruitment.

Endpoint adjudication committee An end point committee consisting of a trial monitor and 2 clinicians, blinded to treatment allocation, will be established to adjudicate the non-fatal cardiovascular events at 6 monthly intervals. This committee will also advise on event rate, (blinded) group separation, feasibility and stopping rules.","Inclusion Criteria:

Statistical methods: The Statistical Consulting Group (University of Melbourne), supervised by team statistician Dr Sandy Clarke,will advise and supervise statistical methods, data management, integrity, security and analysis. The primary outcome will be compared between FCU and control groups using binary logistic regression, with the control group as the reference category. The survival times will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A pre-determined sub-group analysis will separate those with and without an existing TTE in the previous 12 months. Relative risk of death will be analysed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Patterns of management and relative risk (of death) will be compared between groups using a two-sample t-test including sub-group analysis of pathology identified by FCU (e.g., hypovolaemia, cardiac failure and aortic stenosis). Clinical trial coordination: The trial will be managed through the Department of Surgery, The University of Melbourne. This will include all aspects of trial control, data collation, and site co-ordination. An independent committee including a statistician, clinical trial monitor, clinician, and member of the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee will oversee trial safety and data integrity. The committee will perform a planned, blinded interim analysis, after 50% recruitment. Endpoint adjudication committee An end point committee consisting of a trial monitor and 2 clinicians, blinded to treatment allocation, will be established to adjudicate the non-fatal cardiovascular events at 6 monthly intervals. This committee will also advise on event rate, (blinded) group separation, feasibility and stopping rules. Inclusion Criteria: * Patients presenting with isolated, primary, non-metastatic fractured neck of femur, where surgery is expected within 48 hours after hospital admission will be recruited. Exclusion Criteria: * Patients with prior hip surgery on the affected side, or where the cause is likely to be due to metastatic cancer, or where survival is unlikely in the 24 hours from admission will not be included."

The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of combining and then following a high potency topical corticosteroid treatment with LCD treatment for moderate-to-severe localized plaque psoriasis.","Superpotent topical corticosteroids such as clobetasol propionate are highly effective in treating plaque psoriasis but are not indicated for long term use due to their side effects. Therefore, steroid-sparing combination and sequential regimens, in which the corticosteroid gets supplemented with a non-steroid medication, such as calcipotriol or tazarotene, have become the standard of care, especially in the management of localized psoriasis lesions. A new steroid-free 15% liquor carbonis distillate (LCD) solution (Psorent) was recently found to be more successful than 0.005% calcipotriol cream (Dovonex) at improving and delaying worsening of psoriasis symptoms in a controlled clinical trial. The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate if this LCD solution can be used in combination with acute topical corticosteroid therapy as a new steroid-sparing / enhancing regimen.

During this surgical procedure the surgeon cuts into uterine cavity through abdominal wall and takes out the baby. This is done by by making the lower half body of the patient numb by injecting local anesthesia drugs into the space surrounding the spinal cord. This allows the mother to remain awake and immediately bond with the baby once it gets delivered. Also this technique provides effective pain relief both during and after the surgery. However like any other technique or drug it is associated with a number of side effects. The most important being fall in blood pressure. There are numerous ways to treat it. However if one is able to predict fall in blood pressure before administration of anesthetic technique one can easily prevent it. One of the recently discovered novel way to predict fall in blood pressure is Perfusion index which is calculated by Pulse oximeter. It is a device use to check amount of oxygen in blood and heart rate. Perfusion index refers to the total amount of blood present in the limbs of the person. Once we administer drug in the space surrounding the spinal cord the amount of blood in the limbs increases while the amount returning to heart decreases which ultimately results in less amount of blood being pumped out by heart resulting in fall in blood pressure. Therefore theoretically those individuals who have a high baseline Perfusion index will more likely to develop low blood pressure. This study aims to identify the cut off value of perfusion index to predict fall in blood pressure.,"Spinal anesthesia is employed to provide excellent surgical conditions in case of C-Section. It is the anesthetic technique of choice among obstetric patients. However it is associated with sympathectomy which reduces the venous return and ultimately causes hypotension. This hypotension is mainly due to redistribution of blood volume to the peripheral compartment. Perfusion index which is measured by Pulse Oximetery is a ratio of pulsatile to non-pulsatile blood in the peripheral compartment of the body. As spinal anesthesia causes sympathectomy, peripheral blood volume increases. As a result perfusion index value should rise. This will then co-relate with hypotension.

There is no cure for wet-AMD but anti-VEGF treatments significantly minimize the vision loss over time. To study the correlation between anti-VEGF injection bevacizumab (Lucentis), visual acuity, macular thickness and last but not least reading speed in wet-AMD patients.

The study was conducted on 50 eyes of 50 wet-AMD patients. Subjects were monthly treated with an intra-vitreal Lucentis injection for 3 months; further injections were given when a loss of 5 or more letters of visual acuity was observed and/or when the retinal thickness in the affected macular area increased by 100 µm. In addition to a full ophthalmological examination reading speed was investigated via the Radner reading chart before and 3 months after treatment. The collected data was analyzed using paired t-tests.","Age related macular degeneration also known as AMD is the most common cause of blindness in Europe, the USA and other industrialized countries. AMD appears in people above the age of 50. The origin despite intensive research and many clinical trials is not fully understood. However, it is assumed that AMD is multifactorial. It has metabolic, genetic and environmental components that play crucial roles in the development of the disease. The interaction of different etiologic risk factors in chronic changes in the macular area (choroid, Bruch's membrane, and retinal pigment epithelium) is reflected in a slowly progressive loss of vision. AMD is classified into a dry and a wet form. The dry form represents 80% of all AMDs and it only leads to blindness in 10% of the cases. Dry AMD is characterized by drusen, pigmentary changes (hypo/hyper-pigmentation and-or atrophy of the photoreceptors with the RPE and the choriocapillaries as well). A successful therapy for this form is still unknown, but studies have shown that a change in lifestyle and dietary supplements (vitamins) can slow the progression of the disease. The wet form represents 20% of AMDs, but in 80-90% of the cases patients may experience rapid and serious vision loss. The vision loss is due to the formation of abnormal blood vessels, which are leaking in the choroid because they have no barrier and cause accumulation of blood and fluid in the intraretinal and/or subretinal space and ultimately leading to an irreversible scarring stage (Kuhnt-Junius scar). Against wet-AMD, there are numerous treatment possibilities, and they are very efficient.

Institut Mutualiste Montsouris,OTHER,NCT06401902,Diabetes and Risk of Ischemic Stroke.,Diabetes and Stroke: Does an Excess Risk of Hemodynamic Cerebral Ischemia Exist?,"Diabetes in an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke, whose associated mortality rate is higher and sequelae more serious than for nondiabetics. Diabetes increases the risk of stroke or death after surgical carotid revascularization or endoluminal angioplasty. It is, with contralateral ICA occlusion, 1 of the 7 factors doubling the stroke risk after carotid endarterectomy. Diabetes also enhances the cerebral hemorrhage risk associated with carotid surgery, thrombectomy or thrombolysis revascularization of the cerebral arteries.

This study was undertaken to examine whether the hemodynamic cerebral ischemia (HCI) frequency, which increases stroke severity, is higher in diabetics than nondiabetics and, if diabetes carries an excess HCI risk, whether it is independent of contralateral ICA occlusion.","Embolic and hemodynamic mechanisms are the main causes underlying ischemic strokes of carotid origin. The hemodynamic cerebral ischemia (HCI) risk depends on the contribution of the contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral arteries via the circle of Willis, the ipsilateral external carotid artery via the ophthalmic artery and the leptomeningeal arteries. During carotid surgery, impaired collateral flow is associated with the need for shunt insertion.

When HCI is present, cerebral perfusion is initially maintained by vasodilation of precapillary arterioles and the increased extraction coefficient of oxygen. Secondarily, vascular reserve exhaustion by degradation of arterial lesions engenders a loss of cerebral autoregulation, ischemic penumbra and cerebral infarction.

Carotid revascularization with an incomplete circle of Willis enhances the postoperative ischemic stroke risk. The loss of cerebral autoregulation, attributable to HCI combined with ipsilateral carotid tight stenosis, heightens the risk of hyperperfusion and cerebral hemorrhage.

Carotid occlusion is the primary cause of HCI. Carotid occlusions and tight stenoses lead to loss of cerebral autoregulation and cerebrovascular reserve, and have been associated with a 4-fold-increased stroke risk.

Nemours Children's Clinic,OTHER,NCT04119284,Safety Outcomes of Vertebral Body Tethering Technique,Safety and Efficacy of a Vertebral Body Tethering Technique for Pediatric Idiopathic Scoliosis,The objectives of this study is to assess whether the intervention (Anterior Vertebral Tethering) is a safe and efficacious method of anterior approach surgery for spinal deformity in pediatric scoliosis.,"Scoliosis is a condition where the spine is deformed by a curvature in the coronal plane. It is generally associated with a twisting (axial plane) deformity as well.

Curves between 10 and 25 degrees are considered mild. Curves between 25- and 50 degrees are classified as moderate. Curves greater than 50 degrees are termed severe. The current standard of care for moderate Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis(AIS) in patients with remaining growth is to utilize a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO brace) to prevent progression of deformity. The scientific evidence has supported the efficacy of this intervention in avoiding progression of the Cobb angle to 50 degrees or more.

If treated with a TLSO brace, many idiopathic scoliosis patients would conceivably be subjected to years of brace wear and the cost and psychological factors inherent therein. Additional downsides of brace treatment include the potentially negative psychosocial impact of wearing an external sign of deformity during adolescence, a key period of emotional development. Prior research has identified negative psychosocial effects related to wearing a brace in children.

Recent evidence has suggested that certain curve patterns will likely progress to 50 degrees or more, despite treatment with a TLSO brace. Sanders, et al. demonstrated a correlation of Cobb angle (greater than 35 degrees) and skeletal maturity (bone age 4 or less) to the risk of progression to 50 degrees or more, despite TLSO bracing.

Dr. Soetomo General Hospital,OTHER_GOV,NCT06139679,Improvement In Left Ventricular Diameter After Closure Of ASD With Fenestrated Patch: A Cross-sectional Study,Improvement In Left Ventricular Diameter After Closure Of Atrial Septal Defect With Fenestrated Patch: A Cross-sectional Study,"Introduction: The presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in atrial septal defect (ASD) poses a clinical challenge on whether or not to close the defect. Closing the defect increases the risk of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), while leaving the defect open may eventually lead to irreparable shunt reversal, hypoxemia, and death. The implementation of a fenestrated patch may halt LCOS while adding volume to the left heart.

Methods: this is an analytical observational study involving patients with ostium secundum defect with PH who were operated on in Dr. Soetomo Hospital between January 2017 and October 2021. The aim of this study is to evaluate the improvement in left ventricular size during both systole and diastole.","Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases. It is typically characterized by a left-to-right shunt which results in volume overload of the right ventricle and overcirculation of the pulmonary vascularization (le Gloan et al., 2018). This may further result in arrhythmia, right ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pulmonary hypertension is caused by endothelial dysfunction, remodelling of the pulmonary vascularization, which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventually causes shunt reversal into right-to-left (Eisenmenger's syndrome). At this point, closure of the defect is contraindicated.

Small LV, although less extensively studied than dilated LV, also implies impaired LV function. Small LV means less tolerance to volume overload, which in turn impairs cardiac output and presents higher risk of heart failure and mortality (Saito et al., 2021).

ASD closure in cases with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) presents a clinical challenge. Complete closure may cause pulmonary hypertensive crisis and low cardiac output syndrome; however, if left untreated, the disease progresses, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases, which may also lead to Eisenmenger's syndrome and shunt reversal. Today, this condition is treated with fenestrated closure, either with patch or fenestrated septal occluder. The fenestration is hypothesized to provide protective effect against pulmonary hypertensive crisis because it allows blood to flow from right to left heart. The added volume into the left heart is then, hypothesized, to provide volume training for the left heart, mainly in the case of small LV. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of fenestrated closure compared to non- fenestrated closure to the left ventricular size at systole and diastole.","Inclusion Criteria:

However, yet there is no guideline for these discharge criteria, including for patients with (potential) Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). To establish proper discharge criteria concerning OSA more information about (changes in) OSA during the first days after bariatric surgery is required.

The aim of this study is to assess postoperative Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) changes during the first and third night after Same-Day Discharge bariatric surgery in patients with potentially untreated OSA.

Methods: Patients (n=60) will undergo a Home Sleep Apnea test , pre-operatively and during the first en third postoperative night after bariatric surgery to asses the AHI and sleep architecture.","Rationale:

Bariatric surgery is a highly effective and sustainable treatment against obesity. Recently there has been a trend towards Same-Day Discharge (SDD) bariatric surgery. SDD bariatric surgery has proven to be safe, when proper discharge criteria are used. However, there is no consensus or guideline for discharge criteria for SDD bariatric surgery. In particular, discharge criteria for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diverge between hospitals. In some, but not all hospitals, having (untreated) OSA is a contra-indication for SDD bariatric surgery.

In Rijnstate hospital, bariatric patients are not routinely tested for OSA preoperatively, meaning that they potentially have undiagnosed OSA. Having potentially undiagnosed OSA, is not a contra-indication for SDD bariatric surgery in Rijnstate hospital. Hospitals could be hesitant for SDD bariatric surgery in patients with OSA, because it is known that the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) increases postoperatively. In a population without obesity, the highest postoperative AHI was found during the third postoperative night. During this third postoperative night, patients with a normal postoperative course will already sleep at home, both after inpatient and SDD bariatric surgery. This raises the question whether having (untreated) OSA should be a contra-indication for SDD bariatric surgery. However, it is unknown if the same postoperative changes in AHI and sleep architecture occur in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess postoperative Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) changes during the first and third night after Same-Day Discharge bariatric surgery in patients with potentially untreated OSA. The secondary objective of this study is to compare postoperative AHI changes between patients with a pre-operative AHI of 0-14 or ≥15.

Misha D.P. Luyer,OTHER,NCT02175979,SANICS II Trial: Stimulation of the Autonomic Nervous System in Colorectal Surgery by Perioperative Nutrition,SANICS II Trial: A Multicenter Prospective Double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial Investigating the Effect of Stimulation of the Autonomic Nervous System in Colorectal Surgery by Perioperative Nutrition,"The main objective is to investigate the effects of perioperative nutrition on postoperative ileus and anastomotic leakage in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

Perioperative enteral nutrition is compared to the standard of care (fasting perioperatively).","Postoperative ileus (POI) and anastomotic leakage (AL) are important clinical determinants of short-term morbidity and mortality following colorectal surgery. Importantly, AL is also a risk factor for local recurrence of colorectal cancer and has a significant impact on disease-free and overall survival. It is therefore believed that improving postoperative outcome following colorectal surgery will also improve long-term oncological outcomes regarding overall survival and tumour recurrence. POI is a common complication after colorectal surgery that causes discomfort for the patient but also leads to a prolonged hospital length of stay and increasing health care costs. For POI it is believed that formation of an inflammatory infiltrate in the muscular layers of the intestine following bowel manipulation during surgery leads to a decreased gastrointestinal motility. In recent years the investigators have demonstrated in experimental models that administration of enteral nutrition modulates the inflammatory response via the autonomic nervous system by release of cholecystokinin (CCK). Composition of the enteral nutrition and timing of administration are both essential for the magnitude of effect. For the most optimal effect, nutrition is given with a higher fraction of lipids and protein and is administered just before, during and directly after the inciting event. In this way, the inflammatory response is optimally dampened via release of CCK. In an experimental study has been shown that such a lipid-enriched enteral nutrition reduces systemic inflammation and postoperative ileus in a CCK-dependent manner when given just before and directly after bowel manipulation. Next, the investigators performed a study in healthy volunteers in which the effect of continuous low volume enteral nutrition was investigated on inflammatory parameters in a human endotoxemia model. In this study was shown that lipid enriched nutrition reduced the inflammatory response upon endotoxemia in man. Also in a clinical setting the investigators have shown that enteral nutrition reduces inflammation and postoperative ileus. In a randomized controlled trial the investigators have shown that enteral nutrition early after colorectal surgery reduced POI. Furthermore, in a model of sham-feeding using chewing gum was shown that inflammation and postoperative ileus were reduced following colorectal surgery. Interestingly, both clinical studies with sham feeding and early enteral nutrition revealed a yet unaccountable effect on anastomotic leakage. Evidence on the relation between POI and anastomotic leakage is scarce but has great impact. It seems that an early intervention with enteral nutrition shortly before, during and early after colorectal surgery may reduce inflammation and reduce important determinants in postoperative morbidity as POI and anastomotic leakage.

All patients will receive a self-migrating nasojejunal tube one day before surgery. The position of the nasojejunal tube is verified by means of an X-ray at the night before surgery. Preoperatively, patients receive standard of care with a fast for solid (oral) food of 6 hours and a (oral) fluid fast for 2 hours before administration. Three hours before surgery the pump is started to administer nutrition in standardized amounts. Enriched enteral nutrition (produced by Danone research) is administered via a programmed Flocare enteral feeding pump. The pump is connected to the opaque branched system that is connected both to the nasojejunal tube and to a sealed container. Patients are either allocated to the experimental group, in which the blinded branched system leads the enteral nutrition via the nasojejunal tube to the patient. Via this route, the patients in the experimental group will receive the enteral nutrition just before, during and directly after surgery. In patients allocated to the control group, the blinded branched system leads the enteral nutrition to the container. Consequently, when the feeding pump starts just before surgery, patients in the control group do not receive the nutrition. In both groups, the pump with enteral nutrition is stopped 6 hours after surgery and normal intake is resumed.

Based on previous results a power calculation is performed. For POI a sample size of at least 91 patients per group is needed based on a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. For AL a reduction of AL of at least 75% was observed in the previous clinical studies. Using a power of 0.8 and a drop-out percentage of 5% a total of 140 patients are needed per group. Since perioperative nutrition is a new concept, a safety analysis is performed after inclusion of 40 patients in which feasibility and safety of preoperative nutrition are assessed. The effect size is determined based on previous studies and is substantial. Considering the size of the effect, an interim-analysis will be performed after inclusion of 140 patients.

All analyses will be done according to the intention-to-treat approach in which all randomized patients are included, regardless of adherence to the study protocol. Occurrences of the primary and secondary endpoints are compared between the treatment groups. Results are presented as risk ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. A two-tailed P \< 0.05 is considered statistically significant. To compare the groups, the data will be tested for normal distribution and an unpaired T-test will be performed when appropriate, otherwise the Mann-Whitney U or Chi-square tests. SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20) will be used to analyze the data.

Also in a clinical setting the investigators have shown that enteral nutrition reduces inflammation and postoperative ileus. In a randomized controlled trial the investigators have shown that enteral nutrition early after colorectal surgery reduced POI. Furthermore, in a model of sham-feeding using chewing gum was shown that inflammation and postoperative ileus were reduced following colorectal surgery. Interestingly, both clinical studies with sham feeding and early enteral nutrition revealed a yet unaccountable effect on anastomotic leakage. Evidence on the relation between POI and anastomotic leakage is scarce but has great impact. It seems that an early intervention with enteral nutrition shortly before, during and early after colorectal surgery may reduce inflammation and reduce important determinants in postoperative morbidity as POI and anastomotic leakage. All patients will receive a self-migrating nasojejunal tube one day before surgery. The position of the nasojejunal tube is verified by means of an X-ray at the night before surgery. Preoperatively, patients receive standard of care with a fast for solid (oral) food of 6 hours and a (oral) fluid fast for 2 hours before administration. Three hours before surgery the pump is started to administer nutrition in standardized amounts. Enriched enteral nutrition (produced by Danone research) is administered via a programmed Flocare enteral feeding pump. The pump is connected to the opaque branched system that is connected both to the nasojejunal tube and to a sealed container. Patients are either allocated to the experimental group, in which the blinded branched system leads the enteral nutrition via the nasojejunal tube to the patient. Via this route, the patients in the experimental group will receive the enteral nutrition just before, during and directly after surgery. In patients allocated to the control group, the blinded branched system leads the enteral nutrition to the container. Consequently, when the feeding pump starts just before surgery, patients in the control group do not receive the nutrition. In both groups, the pump with enteral nutrition is stopped 6 hours after surgery and normal intake is resumed. Based on previous results a power calculation is performed. For POI a sample size of at least 91 patients per group is needed based on a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. For AL a reduction of AL of at least 75% was observed in the previous clinical studies. Using a power of 0.8 and a drop-out percentage of 5% a total of 140 patients are needed per group. Since perioperative nutrition is a new concept, a safety analysis is performed after inclusion of 40 patients in which feasibility and safety of preoperative nutrition are assessed. The effect size is determined based on previous studies and is substantial. Considering the size of the effect, an interim-analysis will be performed after inclusion of 140 patients. All analyses will be done according to the intention-to-treat approach in which all randomized patients are included, regardless of adherence to the study protocol. Occurrences of the primary and secondary endpoints are compared between the treatment groups. Results are presented as risk ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. A two-tailed P \< 0.05 is considered statistically significant. To compare the groups, the data will be tested for normal distribution and an unpaired T-test will be performed when appropriate, otherwise the Mann-Whitney U or Chi-square tests. SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20) will be used to analyze the data. The investigators respect the Dutch Scientific Code of conduct with regard to collection and storage of our data.

Sheba Medical Center,OTHER_GOV,NCT02821702,Fertility Post Placenta Accrete,Fertility Post Preservative Cesarean Section and Uterine Artery Embolization,This study is the first to investigate the fertility outcome and the influence on ovarian reserve after using uterine artery embolization during cesarean delivery.,"Placenta accreta is an abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall. Three variants of abnormally invasive placentation have been described: placenta accreta, in which placental villi invade the surface of the myometrium; placenta increta, in which placental villi extend into the myometrium; and placenta percreta, where the villi penetrate through the myometrium to the uterine serosa and may invade adjacent organs, such as the bladder.

Placenta accrete is an increasingly prevalent and potentially dangerous complication of pregnancy. It appears to be most strongly predicted by a history of cesarean deliveries and low-lying placenta/previa. Additional risk factors include in vitro fertilization pregnancy, prior myomectomy, Asherman's syndrome, submucous leiomyomata, maternal age older than 35 years, elevated second-trimester levels of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin.

Pregnancies complicated with placenta accrete are associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including life-threatening maternal haemorrhage, large-volume blood transfusion, uterine rupture and peripartum hysterectomy. Moreover , strong association was found between abnormal placentation to significant perinatal morbidity and mortality such as small for gestational age, preterm delivery, neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization, perinatal death and neonatal death.

Prenatal diagnosis and adequate planning, particularly in high-risk populations, is indicated for the reduction of these adverse outcomes. Advances in grayscale and Doppler ultrasound have facilitated prenatal diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging techniques, no diagnostic technique affords the clinician complete assurance of the presence or absence of placenta accreta.

Management of placenta accrete could be conservative (aiming for uterine preservation) or interventional ( elective cesarean hysterectomy ) depending on the patients will to maintain the uterus for future fertility, the degree of placentation abnormality or complications during delivery. The extent (area, depth) of the abnormal attachment will determine the response-curettage, wedge resection, medical management, or hysterectomy. Uterine conserving options may work in small focal accretas, but abdominal hysterectomy usually is the most definitive treatment.

Post-partum hemorrhage is the major concern dealing with placenta accrete. Women with placenta accreta have a higher incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and are more likely to undergo emergency hysterectomy .

If the diagnosis or a strong suspicion is formed before delivery, a number of measures should be taken including counseling the patient about the likelihood of hysterectomy and blood transfusion, preparing blood products and clotting factors and considering using cell saver technology.The appropriate location and timing for delivery should be considered to allow access to adequate surgical personnel and equipment and a preoperative anesthesia assessment should be obtained.

A patient with stable vital signs and persistent bleeding, especially if the rate of loss is not excessive, may be a candidate for arterial embolization. Radiographic identification of bleeding vessels allows embolization with gelfoam, coils, or glue. Balloon occlusion is also a technique used in such circumstances. Embolization can be used for bleeding that continues after hysterectomy or can be used as an alternative to hysterectomy to preserve fertility.

Studies estimating the fertility and pregnancy outcomes after successful conservative treatment for placenta accrete have demonstrated placenta accreta does not appear to compromise the patients' subsequent fertility or obstetrical outcome.

By reviewing the literature, no prospective studies have specifically evaluated fertility, following uterine artery embolization during cesarean section due to placenta accrete .

Methods:

Women that were operated and fit inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study after getting advanced notice on requirements . After giving informed consent to participate in the study, demographic parameters and medical history will be taken, including - age , Body Mass Index ( BMI), parity, gravity, past medical history, past operations.

Placenta accreta is an abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall. Three variants of abnormally invasive placentation have been described: placenta accreta, in which placental villi invade the surface of the myometrium; placenta increta, in which placental villi extend into the myometrium; and placenta percreta, where the villi penetrate through the myometrium to the uterine serosa and may invade adjacent organs, such as the bladder. Placenta accrete is an increasingly prevalent and potentially dangerous complication of pregnancy. It appears to be most strongly predicted by a history of cesarean deliveries and low-lying placenta/previa. Additional risk factors include in vitro fertilization pregnancy, prior myomectomy, Asherman's syndrome, submucous leiomyomata, maternal age older than 35 years, elevated second-trimester levels of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin. Pregnancies complicated with placenta accrete are associated with adverse maternal outcomes, including life-threatening maternal haemorrhage, large-volume blood transfusion, uterine rupture and peripartum hysterectomy. Moreover , strong association was found between abnormal placentation to significant perinatal morbidity and mortality such as small for gestational age, preterm delivery, neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization, perinatal death and neonatal death. Prenatal diagnosis and adequate planning, particularly in high-risk populations, is indicated for the reduction of these adverse outcomes. Advances in grayscale and Doppler ultrasound have facilitated prenatal diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging techniques, no diagnostic technique affords the clinician complete assurance of the presence or absence of placenta accreta. Management of placenta accrete could be conservative (aiming for uterine preservation) or interventional ( elective cesarean hysterectomy ) depending on the patients will to maintain the uterus for future fertility, the degree of placentation abnormality or complications during delivery. The extent (area, depth) of the abnormal attachment will determine the response-curettage, wedge resection, medical management, or hysterectomy. Uterine conserving options may work in small focal accretas, but abdominal hysterectomy usually is the most definitive treatment.

"University of Lagos, Nigeria",OTHER,NCT04976179,Iron Infusion Into a Vein Compared to Iron Tablet Taken by Mouth for Treating Iron Deficiency Anemia in Pregnancy (IVON),"Intravenous Versus Oral Iron for Iron Deficiency Anaemia in Pregnant Nigerian Women (IVON): an Open Label, Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Anaemia in pregnancy is a public health burden with high incidence in Africa. Currently high dose oral iron is recommended for treatment of mild to moderate anaemia and blood transfusion for severe anaemia. The high dose oral iron is often poorly tolerated and associated with several side effects. Various parenteral iron preparations are now available for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). The earliest of these, iron dextran is not commonly used because of its potential to cause anaphylactic reactions. Newer preparations have been found to be safer and their use for treatment of IDA is currently being evaluated.

Objective: This study sought out to compare the effectiveness of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (intervention) versus oral ferrous sulphate (control) for treating IDA in pregnancy and to compare the tolerability, safety and the cost-effectiveness of intravenous versus oral iron among pregnant Nigerian women with moderate and severe IDA at 20-32 weeks' gestation.

Methodology: This study will be a hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation design. 1056 eligible and consenting pregnant women with anaemia at 20 - 32 weeks gestation will be recruited. They will be randomized into either of 2 groups. Group A will have intravenous ferric carboxymaltose 20mg/kg to a maximum of 1000mg in 200mls of normal saline infusion over 15 - 20 minutes at enrolment. Group B will have oral ferrous sulphate 200mg (65mg elemental iron) thrice daily from enrolment till delivery. They will be followed up through delivery and until 6 weeks post partum. Their haemoglobin concentration, full blood count, serum ferritin and serum transferrin will be assayed at specific intervals using standard laboratory techniques. Depression will be assessed at each visit using Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale. Cost effectiveness analysis will also be done at each visit. The primary outcome measure will be incidence of maternal anaemia and rise in haemoglobin level. Secondary outcome measures will include safety and tolerability of trial drugs, severe maternal events, incidence of infant low birth weight and incidence of depression. Statistical analysis will be done using STATA version 16.0 statistical software (STATACorp, Texas, USA).","1.0 INTRODUCTION Anemia in pregnancy (AIP) remains a critical global health problem especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), affecting 46% of pregnant women in Africa and 49% in Asia. AIP is defined as a venous blood hemoglobin concentration of \<11 g/dl in a pregnant woman. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the commonest cause of AIP, accounting for 50-75% of AIP. Antenatal maternal anemia has significant implications on both maternal and neonatal outcomes, including maternal mortality from hemorrhage and morbidity from infections, and neonatal low birth weight and prematurity. It has also been associated with an increased risk of depression.

In most LMICs, including Nigeria, routine treatment of IDA in pregnancy is with oral iron preparations, due to fears of serious adverse reactions from parenteral iron, including anaphylaxis, and the belief that oral iron is equally effective. Parenteral, especially intravenous, iron is also more expensive, and it is not clear whether its benefits are worth the cost. In settings like Nigeria, where most people still pay out-of-pocket for healthcare, cost effectiveness is particularly important. However, apart from the side effects caused by oral iron, it also takes longer to correct the anemia, and in cases where patients are unable to absorb iron, oral intake is rendered ineffective. Reservations on use of parenteral iron have been due largely to experience with high molecular weight iron dextran preparations, which had a relatively high incidence of anaphylactic reactions. Fortunately, there are now several safe parenteral iron preparations, such as iron sucrose, iron polymaltose, ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and iron isomaltoside.

2.0 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Aims: To determine the comparative effectiveness of intravenous FCM (intervention) versus oral ferrous sulphate (control) for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy and to compare the tolerability, safety, and the cost-effectiveness of intravenous versus oral iron among pregnant Nigerian women with moderate and severe IDA at 20-32 weeks' gestation. It also aims to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of use of intravenous FCM for treating IDA.

Objectives

1. To determine effect of intravenous FCM on the prevalence of maternal anemia at 36 weeks' gestation and on increase in hemoglobin concentration 4 weeks after administration, compared with oral ferrous sulphate (FS) in pregnant women with IDA.
2. To determine effect of intravenous FCM on incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, sepsis, shock, need for blood transfusion, prevalence of depression and other maternal clinical outcomes, compared with oral FS in pregnant women with IDA.
3. To determine effect of intravenous FCM on the incidence of low infant birthweight, prematurity, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality, and on breastfeeding and immunization, compared with use of oral FS in pregnant women with IDA.
4. To measure implementation outcomes of intravenous FCM including its acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity in the context in which the trial is being carried out.
5. To determine cost-effectiveness of intravenous FCM compared with oral FS in treatment of IDA in pregnancy.

3.0 STUDY DESIGN: This study is a multicenter, parallel, open label, individually randomized controlled trial, with women allocated in a 1:1 ratio in conjunction with a cost-effectiveness analysis.

3.1 Study setting and site selection: The study will be implemented in two most populated states in Nigeria; Kano State in North-West and Lagos State in South-West zone. One tertiary, two secondary and two primary healthcare facilities have been purposively selected from each state, making 10 targeted facilities based on antenatal patient flow, number of deliveries and proximity of all three levels of care to facilitate an effective two-way referral system.

3.2 Sample size calculations: At 5% significance and precision level, 1,056 pregnant women (528 in each study arm) are required to detect a difference in improvement in prevalence of AIP at term by 14%, between control group (70% corrected) and intervention group (84% corrected), as seen in a multi-country international study in Europe, Asia, and Australia (30) at 90% power, adjusting for 15% attrition and protocol violations (31).

3.3 Randomization: At enrolment, eligible participants will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups using a web-based randomization software known as 'Sealed envelope' in a 1:1 ratio in blocks stratified according to center.

3.4 Study intervention: Eligible pregnant women randomized to intervention arm (FCM) will be admitted on a day care basis for treatment initiation and will be given intravenous FCM in a single dose of 20mg/kg up to a maximum of 1000mg in 200 ml 0.9% sodium chloride infusion over a minimum of 15 - 20 minutes. Thereafter, they will be observed for a minimum of 30 minutes before being allowed to go home.

The pregnant women randomized to the control arm (FS) will be given one 200mg tablet of ferrous sulphate containing 65mg of elemental iron, three times daily till 6 weeks post-delivery. The women will be sent daily reminders by text messages, questioned on compliance at each visit and asked to bring in their empty sachets for sighting and pill count.

After delivery, all study participants will be tested for anemia with Hemocue before discharge. Those with hemoglobin concentration less than 11g/dl will be treated as per standard practice i.e., with FS 200mg tds, vitamin C 100mg tds and folic acid 5mg daily.

All study participants in both arms will receive 5mg folic acid daily, vitamin C 100mg tds, and followed from enrollment till delivery and for 6 weeks post-partum. They will be seen 4-weekly till 28 weeks, 2 weekly till 36 weeks and weekly till delivery and then at 2, 4 and 6 weeks postpartum.

3.5 Malaria Treatment and Prevention: Participants will be screened at enrolment for malaria parasitemia with SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f and treated with Artemisinin based combination therapy if positive for malaria parasite. Thereafter, intermittent preventive treatment for malaria will be administered with three doses of three tablets of Sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (500/25) monthly except if patient is allergic to sulphonamides, in which case, patient will be placed on monthly artemisinin-lumefantrine (treatment dose). All pregnant women will also be given long lasting insecticide treated bed nets and counseled on usage.

3.6 Physical examination: Full physical examinations will be performed at baseline, and at each visit. The initial evaluation will also include measurement of patient's weight and blood pressure.

3.7 Laboratory evaluations: These will include:

* Full blood count at enrollment, 4 weeks post enrollment, 36 weeks' gestation, day of delivery and 6 weeks' postpartum.
* Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) with SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f at enrolment and if symptomatic for malaria at any time.
* Hemoglobin concentration with the Hemocue haemoglobinometer at enrolment and every study visit. The first will be used for enrollment.
* Iron profile: This will comprise serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation at 4 weeks post enrollment, 36 weeks' gestation, day of delivery and 6 weeks postpartum. Only serum ferritin will be done at enrolment.
* Serum phosphate: maternal phosphate level at enrollment, 4 weeks post enrollment, on day of delivery and 6 weeks postpartum; and cord blood phosphate on day of delivery.

All samples aside point of care tests (POCT) will be analyzed at Synlab (an internationally accredited medical laboratory).

3.9 Visit schedules and assessments

* The participants' subsequent clinic visits will be scheduled to hold every 4 weeks till 28 weeks' gestation and every 2 weeks till 36 weeks, then weekly until delivery. Thereafter, they will be seen at 2, 4 and 6 weeks postpartum. Reminders on appointments will be sent by SMS to all participants 24 hours before scheduled visit.
* Women diagnosed as having depression using Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) will be referred to a psychiatrist for further management.

4.0 DATA ANALYSIS PLAN Data analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. For continuous variables, a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality will be performed, and normally distributed data will be presented as means ± SD, while non-normally distributed data will be presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The risk of occurrence of IUGR, perinatal death and other key outcome variables will be computed and compared in both groups. A multivariate regression analysis will be performed to determine the odds of each of the key outcomes among women who received the intervention with respect to those who did not, after controlling for common confounders. This will be presented as regression coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. Level of significance will be set at 5%. Post-regression analysis will be performed to determine the goodness-of-fit of the final model. STATA version15.0 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA) will be used for statistical analysis.

5.0 MONITORING PLAN - There will also be a Steering committee, Clinical Trial Monitors, and a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).

6.0 ETHICS AND RESEARCH INTEGRITY: This trial has been registered in Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR202012843695208), International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN63484804) and Nigeria Clinical Trial Registry (NCTR, 86233598).

However, apart from the side effects caused by oral iron, it also takes longer to correct the anemia, and in cases where patients are unable to absorb iron, oral intake is rendered ineffective. Reservations on use of parenteral iron have been due largely to experience with high molecular weight iron dextran preparations, which had a relatively high incidence of anaphylactic reactions. Fortunately, there are now several safe parenteral iron preparations, such as iron sucrose, iron polymaltose, ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and iron isomaltoside. 2.0 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Aims: To determine the comparative effectiveness of intravenous FCM (intervention) versus oral ferrous sulphate (control) for treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy and to compare the tolerability, safety, and the cost-effectiveness of intravenous versus oral iron among pregnant Nigerian women with moderate and severe IDA at 20-32 weeks' gestation. It also aims to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of use of intravenous FCM for treating IDA. Objectives 1. To determine effect of intravenous FCM on the prevalence of maternal anemia at 36 weeks' gestation and on increase in hemoglobin concentration 4 weeks after administration, compared with oral ferrous sulphate (FS) in pregnant women with IDA. 2. To determine effect of intravenous FCM on incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, sepsis, shock, need for blood transfusion, prevalence of depression and other maternal clinical outcomes, compared with oral FS in pregnant women with IDA. 3. To determine effect of intravenous FCM on the incidence of low infant birthweight, prematurity, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality, and on breastfeeding and immunization, compared with use of oral FS in pregnant women with IDA. 4. To measure implementation outcomes of intravenous FCM including its acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity in the context in which the trial is being carried out. 5. To determine cost-effectiveness of intravenous FCM compared with oral FS in treatment of IDA in pregnancy. 3.0 STUDY DESIGN: This study is a multicenter, parallel, open label, individually randomized controlled trial, with women allocated in a 1:1 ratio in conjunction with a cost-effectiveness analysis. 3.1 Study setting and site selection: The study will be implemented in two most populated states in Nigeria; Kano State in North-West and Lagos State in South-West zone. One tertiary, two secondary and two primary healthcare facilities have been purposively selected from each state, making 10 targeted facilities based on antenatal patient flow, number of deliveries and proximity of all three levels of care to facilitate an effective two-way referral system. 3.2 Sample size calculations: At 5% significance and precision level, 1,056 pregnant women (528 in each study arm) are required to detect a difference in improvement in prevalence of AIP at term by 14%, between control group (70% corrected) and intervention group (84% corrected), as seen in a multi-country international study in Europe, Asia, and Australia (30) at 90% power, adjusting for 15% attrition and protocol violations (31). 3.3 Randomization: At enrolment, eligible participants will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups using a web-based randomization software known as 'Sealed envelope' in a 1:1 ratio in blocks stratified according to center. 3.4 Study intervention: Eligible pregnant women randomized to intervention arm (FCM) will be admitted on a day care basis for treatment initiation and will be given intravenous FCM in a single dose of 20mg/kg up to a maximum of 1000mg in 200 ml 0.9% sodium chloride infusion over a minimum of 15 - 20 minutes. Thereafter, they will be observed for a minimum of 30 minutes before being allowed to go home. The pregnant women randomized to the control arm (FS) will be given one 200mg tablet of ferrous sulphate containing 65mg of elemental iron, three times daily till 6 weeks post-delivery. The women will be sent daily reminders by text messages, questioned on compliance at each visit and asked to bring in their empty sachets for sighting and pill count. After delivery, all study participants will be tested for anemia with Hemocue before discharge. Those with hemoglobin concentration less than 11g/dl will be treated as per standard practice i.e., with FS 200mg tds, vitamin C 100mg tds and folic acid 5mg daily. All study participants in both arms will receive 5mg folic acid daily, vitamin C 100mg tds, and followed from enrollment till delivery and for 6 weeks post-partum. They will be seen 4-weekly till 28 weeks, 2 weekly till 36 weeks and weekly till delivery and then at 2, 4 and 6 weeks postpartum. 3.5 Malaria Treatment and Prevention: Participants will be screened at enrolment for malaria parasitemia with SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f and treated with Artemisinin based combination therapy if positive for malaria parasite. Thereafter, intermittent preventive treatment for malaria will be administered with three doses of three tablets of Sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (500/25) monthly except if patient is allergic to sulphonamides, in which case, patient will be placed on monthly artemisinin-lumefantrine (treatment dose). All pregnant women will also be given long lasting insecticide treated bed nets and counseled on usage. 3.6 Physical examination: Full physical examinations will be performed at baseline, and at each visit. The initial evaluation will also include measurement of patient's weight and blood pressure. 3.7 Laboratory evaluations: These will include: * Full blood count at enrollment, 4 weeks post enrollment, 36 weeks' gestation, day of delivery and 6 weeks' postpartum. * Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) with SD BIOLINE Malaria Ag P.f at enrolment and if symptomatic for malaria at any time. * Hemoglobin concentration with the Hemocue haemoglobinometer at enrolment and every study visit. The first will be used for enrollment. * Iron profile: This will comprise serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation at 4 weeks post enrollment, 36 weeks' gestation, day of delivery and 6 weeks postpartum. Only serum ferritin will be done at enrolment. * Serum phosphate: maternal phosphate level at enrollment, 4 weeks post enrollment, on day of delivery and 6 weeks postpartum; and cord blood phosphate on day of delivery. All samples aside point of care tests (POCT) will be analyzed at Synlab (an internationally accredited medical laboratory). 3.9 Visit schedules and assessments * The participants' subsequent clinic visits will be scheduled to hold every 4 weeks till 28 weeks' gestation and every 2 weeks till 36 weeks, then weekly until delivery. Thereafter, they will be seen at 2, 4 and 6 weeks postpartum. Reminders on appointments will be sent by SMS to all participants 24 hours before scheduled visit. * Women diagnosed as having depression using Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) will be referred to a psychiatrist for further management. 4.0 DATA ANALYSIS PLAN Data analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. For continuous variables, a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality will be performed, and normally distributed data will be presented as means ± SD, while non-normally distributed data will be presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The risk of occurrence of IUGR, perinatal death and other key outcome variables will be computed and compared in both groups. A multivariate regression analysis will be performed to determine the odds of each of the key outcomes among women who received the intervention with respect to those who did not, after controlling for common confounders. This will be presented as regression coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. Level of significance will be set at 5%. Post-regression analysis will be performed to determine the goodness-of-fit of the final model. STATA version15.0 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA) will be used for statistical analysis. 5.0 MONITORING PLAN - There will also be a Steering committee, Clinical Trial Monitors, and a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). 6.0 ETHICS AND RESEARCH INTEGRITY: This trial has been registered in Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR202012843695208), International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN63484804) and Nigeria Clinical Trial Registry (NCTR, 86233598). Ethical approvals have been obtained from the National Health Research and Ethics Committee of Nigeria (NHREC), and HREC of both teaching hospitals and health care boards in both states. All study investigators and site coordinators are GCP certified. The research nurses will also be GCP certified. All participants will sign informed consent form prior to enrolment. Personal data of each participant will be kept strictly confidential and will be stored securely in a central electronic database. Only authorized personnel will have access to the data of all participants collated centrally. The statistician will be granted access to the electronic database during statistical analysis or at any other time the PI might require her to review the data. All research drugs and investigations relating to the research will be offered free. This research poses minimal or no risk to both mother and baby. Blood specimen collection might cause minimal discomfort in form of pain and care will be taken to minimize this. The intervention drug FCM is known to be safe in pregnancy and is not expected to have significant adverse effects on participants. All research staff will be adequately trained to monitor, recognize, and manage any significant adverse drug event. In the rare instance of any moderate/severe adverse drug events such as hypophosphatemia and anaphylaxis, trained research staff will effectively resuscitate and transfer care to higher level health facility for adequate care at no cost to the participant. All participants will receive other routine medication (malaria prophylaxis, tetanus toxoid prophylaxis and folic acid supplementation) as normally prescribed. Malaria prophylaxis, insecticide treated net and folic acid will be provided to the participants all through pregnancy. The participants will enjoy equal rights and quality care all through the duration of the research. Environmental issues are not applicable to this study. 7.0 DISSEMINATION STRATEGIES The study findings will be presented at conferences (both international and local).

It will compare relaxation training (RT) to prolonged exposure therapy (PE). The project will also examine whether cognitive impairment influences psychotherapy outcome.

Primary hypotheses: (1) Subjects in the PE condition will have significantly less severe PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment than subjects in the RT condition at posttest; (2) Executive functioning will modify the response to both treatments, such that those with impaired executive functioning will demonstrate a smaller reduction in PTSD symptoms (representing less clinically significant change).","PTSD is associated with high rates of mortality from suicide and health complications, high healthcare costs, and diminished health and quality of life. Many military veterans have PTSD due to combat, and many veterans continue to carry the symptoms of PTSD into late life. The percentage of older veterans is expected to increase substantially in coming years (especially as Vietnam-era veterans become older adults). The psychosocial intervention with the most rigorous empirical support for treating PTSD in the general population is a cognitive-behavioral treatment known as exposure therapy (which involves helping patients face feared memories and situations), yet there have been no controlled studies of any psychosocial interventions for PTSD in samples of older adults. Some have argued that older adults will not respond well to exposure because of their cognitive limitations. However, several empirical studies have shown exposure therapy to be safe and effective with older adults with anxiety disorders other than PTSD.

The diagnostic and treatment pathways for multiple cancers have greatly developed over the past decade. However, novel treatments are expensive and currently discrimination between responders and non-responders is still suboptimal. There is a pressing need to develop tools that allow for better disease characterisation and stratification. Personalised medicine, whereby prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases is aimed at the individual level, is a growing field. Predicting patient-specific treatment response is challenging as response depends not only on the characteristics of cancer cells but also on how these cells interact with their immediate surrounding environment and on how the tumour interacts with the host. A simplistic model is therefore insufficient to predict treatment response. Complex, patient-derived animal models have been used to this effect but are expensive, may take up to 6 months to provide clinically relevant answers, and pose ethical issues. In the past in vitro models lacked complexity as they were based solely on the two-dimensional (2D) growth of cancer cells. Nowadays the use of 3D tumour models has provided an extra level of complexity to in vitro studies. With these models it is possible to recreate tumour characteristics that were lost in 2D, such as cell-cell interaction between cancer cells and between cancer and stromal cells, cell-matrix interaction, or hypoxia.

The investigators have developed a 3D complex tumour model - named tumouroid. Using this model, preliminary work has been undertaken which allows the growth of patient-derived tumouroids using primary cancer cells from patients.

This personalised platform can be challenged by therapeutics used in clinical practice and response to treatment can be assessed via appropriate assays.

The study goals are twofold:

To assess patient acceptability to the use of patient derived tumour models for future decision-making, and To assess the feasibility of generating patient derived renal cancer tumouroids and using them as platforms to test drug response.","This trial is a prospective tissue collection of renal cell carcinoma samples, including collection of data using both structured Likert 12 item questionnaires and semi structured interviews to assess acceptability. With the development of patient-derived tumouroids the investigators would like to overcome the current over-simplified strategies that focus on genetic markers as predictors of response. In the future, the investigators hope to establish tumouroids as a personalised platform to predict patient response to treatment that is more cost-efficient and poses less ethical issues than animal platforms.

This project will assess if patient-derived tumouroids can be therapeutically challenged and if patients would be willing to accept that such platform to guide clinical treatment decision making.

This study is designed to assess primarily patient acceptability. Acceptability will be elicited using Likert scale non-validated questionnaires and in a semi-structured interview in which the views and preferences relating the acceptability or otherwise of the patient derived tumour models and their impact on future decision making will be explored.

The study will also assess feasibility of building tumouroids and challenging them. Feasibility will address the successful transition between the critical phases of generating a viable and responsive tumour model. This begins with the extraction of cancer cells from the explanted tumour and ends with the determination of a response or otherwise to a therapeutic challenge of the viable tumour model at a range of in vitro concentrations.

The findings of this study will be presented at conference(s) and manuscripts will be submitted to appropriate journals for publication.","Inclusion Criteria:

Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,OTHER,NCT02867384,Obinutuzumab in cGVHD After Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation,A Randomized Phase 2 Study of Obinutuzumab for Prevention of Chronic Graft-vs.-Host Disease After Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation,This research study is studying a drug called obinutuzumab as a means of preventing chronic Graft vs. Host Disease (cGVHD).,"This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Obinutuzumab for prevention of chronic Graft-vs.-Host Disease (cGVHD), but it has been approved for other uses.

In this research study, the investigators are aiming to determine the effect of Obinutuzumab on the incidence of corticosteroid-requiring cGVHD after allogeneic Hematopoetic Cell Transplant (aHCT).

Chronic GVHD is a medical condition that can occur after bone marrow or stem cells are transplanted from one individual to another. After the transplant, the donor immune system may recognize the recipient body as foreign and may attempt to 'reject' the body. This process is referred to as Graft-vs. -Host Disease and may occur at any time, although generally not earlier than one hundred days after transplantation.

The immune system produces two types of lymphocytes (white blood cells), B cells and T cells. B cells are part of the 'memory' for the immune system, and they make antibodies (proteins) when bacteria, viruses or other potentially harmful materials enter the body. Obinutuzumab is an antibody, a molecule that targets certain cells by binding to specific parts of the target cell. In this case, Obinutuzumab will bind to a component of B cells called CD20, resulting in the B cell getting killed. It is thought that reducing the number of B cells will reduce the chances of developing cGVHD after transplant. Previous studies with another antibody targeting CD20 on B cells suggests that there may be a reduced chance of developing cGVHD and the need to prescribe Corticosteroids to treat cGVHD when B cells are killed.

This is a randomized, placebo controlled trial. This means that approximately half of the study participants will receive Obinutuzumab, and the other half will receive a placebo (saline solution). A computer will decide which participants will receive Obinutuzumab or placebo, and neither the participant or the study doctor will know which the participant has received until the study is completed. It is important to note that the current standard is to receive no therapy specifically to prevent cGVHD.","Inclusion Criteria:

* Subjects deemed potentially eligible by their treating physicians will be screened for enrollment after d+60 from transplantation
* Patients who have undergone either ablative or non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible.
* Peripheral blood stem cells must have been used as the stem cell source.
* Patients must have received transplantation from donors (both related and unrelated) who are identical at 8 HLA loci (A, B, C and DR1), or mismatched at no more than 1 locus (7/8). Among related donors, HLA C typing is not required (6/6 HLA matches). Class I typing is to be performed by PCR-SSP techniques and CDC techniques. Class II typing is performed by PCR-RFLP +/- PCR-SSP techniques.
* No evidence of relapsed or residual malignancy within 30 days of trial entry. All patients must undergo appropriate staging for their malignancy (i.e. bone marrow aspiration for the Leukemias and PET-CT scanning for the lymphomas). Evidence of a persistent Cytogenetic abnormality will constitute evidence of residual or relapsed disease in the Leukemias, where present. Individuals with CLL are eligible if there is no more than 20% residual leukemia in the bone marrow at the time of study entry.
* Patients who have undergone a non-myeloablative stem cell transplant must have \> 80% donor hematopoiesis within 30 days of study enrollment. Chimerism within 30 days of study entry must be greater than, equal to, or no more than 5% less than the chimerism measured at approximately day+30 (if performed).
* Age ≥ 18.0
* ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%) (See Appendix A)
* Participants must have normal marrow function as defined by:

  * WBC ≥ 2,500/μL
  * Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1,000/μL
  * Platelets ≥ 50,000/μL
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
* The effects of Obinutuzumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of Obinutuzumab administration.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Allogeneic stem cell transplantation using a single or multiple umbilical cord blood units or using bone marrow.
* Allogeneic stem cell transplantation using in vivo or ex vivo T cell depletion, either by cell manipulation or with T cell depleting antibodies (Any anti-thymocyte globulin preparation or alemtuzumab given within 30 days of transplantation)
* Participation in a clinical trial evaluating another preventative strategy for chronic GVHD, or ongoing participation in a clinical trial for therapy of acute GVHD. Prior completion of experimental therapy for acute GVHD is permissible if the experimental agent was used \> 30 days prior to enrollment.
* Any evidence of ongoing gastrointestinal or hepatic acute GVHD, or evidence of greater than ongoing Stage I cutaneous acute GVHD. Ongoing, tapering therapy for resolved acute GVHD is permissible.
* Any evidence of prior active or resolved chronic GVHD.
* History of severe allergic reaction to Obinutuzumab
* No Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) prior to day 100, and no plans for a DLI in the upcoming 30 days.

University of Florida,OTHER,NCT01644279,Skeletal Muscle Apoptosis and Physical Performance; Oxidative RNA/DNA Damage and Repair in Aged Human Muscle,Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC); Skeletal Muscle Apoptosis and Physical Performance; Oxidative RNA/DNA Damage and Repair in Aged Human Muscle,"The age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, also termed sarcopenia, is a commonly recognized consequence of aging and has been associated with frailty, functional loss, hospitalization, and increased mortality among older people. Sarcopenia and its consequences have a considerable economic impact, since it has been estimated that the healthcare cost attributable to sarcopenia in the US in 2000 was $ 18.5 billions. Preclinical animal models strongly suggest that apoptosis, a programmed cell death, might play a prominent role in the age-related muscle wasting. In specific aim one, the investigators will assess the extent of muscle apoptosis in muscle biopsies obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of young control subjects (ages 20-35) and high-performance and low-performance older subjects (age range 70-99 years). In specific aim 2, the investigators will investigate the role of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the induction of skeletal muscle apoptosis. In specific aim 3, the investigators propose to investigate the contribution of the muscle energy deficit, due to the age-related mitochondrial dysfunction, in the development of muscle wasting. Finally, in specific aim 4, the investigators propose to reassess after four years physical performance, muscle mass and the extent of muscle apoptosis, in the high-performing participants, in order to correlate eventual decline in physical function, muscle mass and functional status, with changes in muscle apoptosis and in biochemical parameters in this very old population. Physical performance will be established according to the summary performance score obtained in the Short Form Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). In addition to the SPPB the investigators will also employ hand grip strength and knee extensor strength tests and the investigators will quantify muscle contractile area using 3D magnetic resonance imaging. Disability will be assessed using a self-report questionnaire. These studies will enhance our understanding of the biology and pathophysiology underlying the geriatric syndrome of sarcopenia and provide significant and novel insights that will enable us to identify new potential targets for interventions aimed at preventing and treating sarcopenia and functional impairment in older adults.","Specific Aims:

Specific Aim 1. To determine the extent of muscle apoptosis during aging in young healthy controls and in high-functioning and low-functioning older subjects. The investigators hypothesize that the observed level of muscle cell apoptosis is associated with physical disability. The investigators will recruit a cohort of ten young control subjects (age 20-35). The investigators will also recruit and stratify a cohort of forty elderly (age 70-99 years) into two distinct categories by set criteria based on their level of physical performance. Subjects with a summary performance score ≥ 11 at the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (66) will be considered high-functioning. Conversely, subjects with a summary performance score ≤ 7 will be considered low-functioning. In addition to the SPPB, the investigators will also perform the hand grip strength test and the isokinetic knee extensor test, and will implement 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to precisely quantify the quadriceps contractile area. The investigators will obtain a muscle biopsy for each subject to determine the severity of apoptosis using biochemical and histological analyses (see Methods). Disability will be assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Hence, the investigators will determine the extent muscle apoptosis and the investigators will be able to correlate this to the level of physical disability and muscle mass.

Specific Aim 2. To elucidate the role of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the induction of apoptosis in human skeletal muscle. The investigators hypothesize that the observed cell loss due to apoptosis is mainly related to a caspase-independent mechanism. The investigators have recently shown that activation of mitochondrial caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis may play a more important role than the caspase-dependent pathway in contributing to nuclear cell death (67). Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the PARP-1/AIF pathway of apoptosis might be involved in the age-related muscle wasting process. The investigators will quantitatively assess PARP-1 and AIF and correlate these measures with the extent of muscle apoptosis.

Specific Aim 3. To assess the role of mitochondria dysfunction and energy failure in muscle apoptosis, sarcopenia, and disability. The investigators hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting reduced production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is causally related to sarcopenia, possibly by triggering the apoptosis program. It has been estimated that the mean ATP production in the quadriceps muscle of old human subjects is approximately 50% of that of younger subjects (68), and it has been postulated that energy failure might trigger apoptosis (58). Consistently with these findings, the investigators have recently found that in rats' gastrocnemius muscle, ATP content and the rate of ATP production declined by \~50% with age (59). The investigators will quantitatively assess myocytes' ATP content along with key mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, namely citrate synthase, cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX), ATPase, and aconitase. The investigators will correlate these parameters with the level of apoptosis and with measures of physical performance, disability, and muscle mass.

Specific Aim 4. To correlate changes in physical function and muscle mass with muscle apoptosis and biochemical parameters at follow-up (longitudinal study). After 4 years subjects in the high-performance group will be reevaluated for muscle apoptosis rate, PARP-1 and AIF activity, and energy production. The investigators will correlate these parameters with measures of physical performance and muscle mass assessed by MRI, as well as with self-reported disability. Hence, the investigators will be able to directly correlate an eventual decline in physical performance, muscle mass and functional status at this very old age with changes in muscle apoptosis and in biochemical parameters.

Research Plan:

Using a cross-sectional design (age 20-35 and 70-99 years) the investigators will quantify the level of apoptosis in the vastus lateralis muscle in a healthy (see inclusion/exclusion criteria) population. Apoptosis of irreplaceable post-mitotic cells may be important mechanism in the development of sarcopenia and has not been investigated in healthy humans with age. A variety of chronic diseases have documented cases of apoptosis in human skeletal muscle; i.e., chronic pulmonary diseases (69,70) and patients with heart failure (69,71,72). However, it is essential to establish baseline levels of apoptosis in relatively healthy humans before proceeding to more complex conditions, such as disease conditions and frailty. In addition, the investigators will determine knee extensors strength, the myocyte volume, extra cellular space and the myonuclear domain (cross-sectional muscle area/nucleus) by quantifying the number of nuclei within a cross-sectional area of muscle. This specific aim will establish baseline levels of apoptosis and assess standard measures to assess sarcopenia.

Study design. To accomplish our aims, the investigators propose two separates, yet complementary studies

1. In order to gain insights into changes of the apoptosis potential with age and its contribution to muscle mass and strength loss, the investigators will quantify the level of apoptosis in the vastus lateralis muscle in young (age 20-35 years; N =20), old high-functioning, (age 70-99 years; N = 25), and old low-functioning (age 70-99 years; N = 20) subjects. Muscle biopsy and MRI scan to quantify quadriceps contractile area will be performed in the study participants. Muscle strength will be assessed by hand grip strength test and the isokinetic knee extensor test.
2. Preliminary data on the contribution of skeletal muscle apoptosis to sarcopenia, physical function loss in advanced age will be gathered by quantifying the extent of muscle apoptosis in the vastus lateralis muscle of old (age 70-99 years), high-functioning (N = 25) and low-functioning (N = 20) subjects, along with measures of muscle mass (MRI), muscle strength (hand grip and knee extension test), and overall physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB (67)). In addition, the investigators will collect preliminary data regarding the role mitochondrial-driven apoptosis in muscle wasting and functional loss at old age.

A brief physical exam will be administered to all study participants, and major biological signs (body weight, standing height, body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse) will be recorded. A basic questionnaire regarding participants' health history will also be administered

After four years the old participants will be reevaluated for physical performance, functional status muscle mass (MRI), muscle apoptosis, and biochemical parameters Disability will also be assessed using a self-report disability questionnaire. In order to gain information regarding changes in physical performance and functional status with time and to maximize retention, an annual visit employing SPPB, hand grip and knee extensor testing, will be scheduled for the old participants.","Inclusion criteria.

Assessment of disability. The uniform measure proposed to use for the assessment of disability will be a self-report disability questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed for the Fitness Arthritis in Seniors Trial (FAST) and since then has been widely used in intervention and observational studies (e.g. ADAPT, REACT-1, OASIS, CHAMP). The questionnaire is not specific to a certain disease and asks about perceived difficulties in general activities of daily living during the last month. Respondents answer for each of the items whether they experience 1) no difficulty, 2) a little difficulty, 3) some difficulty, 4) a lot of difficulty, 5) unable to do or, 6) did not do for other reasons. Answers can be averaged across the items in order to receive an indication of the overall perceived disability burden by a person.",COMPLETED,,2006-03,2016-07,2016-07,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,63.0,63.0,125.83333333333331,125.83333333333331,3,1,0,United States,Sarcopenia,63,ACTUAL,[],,,1.0,0.0,2006.0,0,0.5006622516556292,1.0,"Skeletal Muscle Apoptosis and Physical Performance; Oxidative RNA/DNA Damage and Repair in Aged Human Muscle Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC); Skeletal Muscle Apoptosis and Physical Performance; Oxidative RNA/DNA Damage and Repair in Aged Human Muscle The age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, also termed sarcopenia, is a commonly recognized consequence of aging and has been associated with frailty, functional loss, hospitalization, and increased mortality among older people. Sarcopenia and its consequences have a considerable economic impact, since it has been estimated that the healthcare cost attributable to sarcopenia in the US in 2000 was $ 18.5 billions. Preclinical animal models strongly suggest that apoptosis, a programmed cell death, might play a prominent role in the age-related muscle wasting. In specific aim one, the investigators will assess the extent of muscle apoptosis in muscle biopsies obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of young control subjects (ages 20-35) and high-performance and low-performance older subjects (age range 70-99 years). In specific aim 2, the investigators will investigate the role of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the induction of skeletal muscle apoptosis. In specific aim 3, the investigators propose to investigate the contribution of the muscle energy deficit, due to the age-related mitochondrial dysfunction, in the development of muscle wasting. Finally, in specific aim 4, the investigators propose to reassess after four years physical performance, muscle mass and the extent of muscle apoptosis, in the high-performing participants, in order to correlate eventual decline in physical function, muscle mass and functional status, with changes in muscle apoptosis and in biochemical parameters in this very old population. Physical performance will be established according to the summary performance score obtained in the Short Form Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). In addition to the SPPB the investigators will also employ hand grip strength and knee extensor strength tests and the investigators will quantify muscle contractile area using 3D magnetic resonance imaging. Disability will be assessed using a self-report questionnaire. These studies will enhance our understanding of the biology and pathophysiology underlying the geriatric syndrome of sarcopenia and provide significant and novel insights that will enable us to identify new potential targets for interventions aimed at preventing and treating sarcopenia and functional impairment in older adults. Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine the extent of muscle apoptosis during aging in young healthy controls and in high-functioning and low-functioning older subjects. The investigators hypothesize that the observed level of muscle cell apoptosis is associated with physical disability. The investigators will recruit a cohort of ten young control subjects (age 20-35). The investigators will also recruit and stratify a cohort of forty elderly (age 70-99 years) into two distinct categories by set criteria based on their level of physical performance. Subjects with a summary performance score ≥ 11 at the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (66) will be considered high-functioning. Conversely, subjects with a summary performance score ≤ 7 will be considered low-functioning. In addition to the SPPB, the investigators will also perform the hand grip strength test and the isokinetic knee extensor test, and will implement 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to precisely quantify the quadriceps contractile area. The investigators will obtain a muscle biopsy for each subject to determine the severity of apoptosis using biochemical and histological analyses (see Methods). Disability will be assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Hence, the investigators will determine the extent muscle apoptosis and the investigators will be able to correlate this to the level of physical disability and muscle mass. Specific Aim 2. To elucidate the role of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in the induction of apoptosis in human skeletal muscle. The investigators hypothesize that the observed cell loss due to apoptosis is mainly related to a caspase-independent mechanism. The investigators have recently shown that activation of mitochondrial caspase-independent pathway of apoptosis may play a more important role than the caspase-dependent pathway in contributing to nuclear cell death (67). Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the PARP-1/AIF pathway of apoptosis might be involved in the age-related muscle wasting process. The investigators will quantitatively assess PARP-1 and AIF and correlate these measures with the extent of muscle apoptosis. Specific Aim 3. To assess the role of mitochondria dysfunction and energy failure in muscle apoptosis, sarcopenia, and disability. The investigators hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting reduced production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is causally related to sarcopenia, possibly by triggering the apoptosis program. It has been estimated that the mean ATP production in the quadriceps muscle of old human subjects is approximately 50% of that of younger subjects (68), and it has been postulated that energy failure might trigger apoptosis (58). Consistently with these findings, the investigators have recently found that in rats' gastrocnemius muscle, ATP content and the rate of ATP production declined by \~50% with age (59). The investigators will quantitatively assess myocytes' ATP content along with key mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, namely citrate synthase, cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX), ATPase, and aconitase. The investigators will correlate these parameters with the level of apoptosis and with measures of physical performance, disability, and muscle mass. Specific Aim 4. To correlate changes in physical function and muscle mass with muscle apoptosis and biochemical parameters at follow-up (longitudinal study). After 4 years subjects in the high-performance group will be reevaluated for muscle apoptosis rate, PARP-1 and AIF activity, and energy production. The investigators will correlate these parameters with measures of physical performance and muscle mass assessed by MRI, as well as with self-reported disability. Hence, the investigators will be able to directly correlate an eventual decline in physical performance, muscle mass and functional status at this very old age with changes in muscle apoptosis and in biochemical parameters. Research Plan: Using a cross-sectional design (age 20-35 and 70-99 years) the investigators will quantify the level of apoptosis in the vastus lateralis muscle in a healthy (see inclusion/exclusion criteria) population. Apoptosis of irreplaceable post-mitotic cells may be important mechanism in the development of sarcopenia and has not been investigated in healthy humans with age. A variety of chronic diseases have documented cases of apoptosis in human skeletal muscle; i.e., chronic pulmonary diseases (69,70) and patients with heart failure (69,71,72). However, it is essential to establish baseline levels of apoptosis in relatively healthy humans before proceeding to more complex conditions, such as disease conditions and frailty.

Hacettepe University,OTHER,NCT04333784,Blood Flow Restriction Training in Patients With Shoulder Pain,The Effect of Blood Flow Restriction Training on Muscle Thickness and Symptoms in Patients With Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy,"This study was planned to investigate the effect of blood flow restriction exercise training on shoulder muscle strength and muscle thickness, and to determine the change in pain and symptoms in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy. Patients in the study group will perform the rehabilitation exercises with a pneumatic cuff and blood flow restricted. The patients in the control group will perform the same exercise program without restricting blood flow.","In recent years, one of the popular applications used for muscle hypertrophy and strength training is low-intensity exercise training called Blood Flow Restriction Training. This exercise training has been shown to allow the benefits of high-intensity training at a much lower intensity. Given the light-load nature and strengthening capacity of this training, it can provide an effective clinical rehabilitation stimulus without the high levels of joint stress. It is suggested that it will be a useful exercise alternative especially in individuals who cannot tolerate high-intensity exercise. Especially patients with shoulder pain cannot tolerate high-intensity exercises in early rehabilitation.

This study was planned to investigate the effect of blood flow restriction exercise training on shoulder muscle strength and muscle thickness, and to determine the change in pain and symptoms in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy.

Hypothesis 1: There is a difference between exercise training with blood flow restriction and exercise training without blood flow restriction in terms of muscle strength and muscle thickness.

Hypothesis 2: There is a difference between exercise training with blood flow restriction and exercise training without blood flow restriction in terms of shoulder pain and shoulder function.

The study was designed as a randomized-controlled. In order to provide an evenly equal number of individuals and homogeneous gender distribution in the groups blocking and stratification will be used as a randomization method. The sample size was calculated to be an 8% difference in muscle thickness at the end of treatment with 80% power and 5% type 1 error. A total of 26 patients were planned to be included in the study, including 13 volunteers in each group. Patients in the study group will perform the determined exercises with a pneumatic cuff and blood flow restricted. The patients in the control group will perform the same exercise program without restricting blood flow. Informed consent will be obtained from all individuals.

Demographic information (age, gender, body mass index, dominant side, affected side, etc.) of all patients will be recorded. Shoulder pain (rest, night and activity- visual analog scale), shoulder range of motions (goniometer), shoulder function (Shoulder Pain and Disability Index-SPADI), shoulder rotator muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometer-Isomed 2000, D\&R Ferstl GmbH, Germany) and supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid, biceps, middle trapezius muscle thickness, and acromio-humeral distance (ultrasonography- Logiq P5, General Electrics, USA) will be evaluated before and after 8 weeks of exercise training.

In the first session of treatment, initial assessments and patient education to reduce shoulder pain (avoiding overhead activities and heavy work, appropriate posture, cold-pack application recommendation) will be performed. Exercise training will start in the second session. Individuals in the groups will have 2 sessions per week, 16 sessions of exercise training for 8 weeks. On other days, patients will continue their home exercises recommended by the physiotherapist.

The blood flow restriction training will be applied to patients in the study group, as defined in the literature, by wearing a pneumatic cuff from the most proximal region of the upper limb. Occlusion pressure will be calculated according to the formula for each patient. \[Pressure = 0.4 x (systolic blood pressure) + 2.7 x (shoulder circumference) + 62\]. Blood flow restriction training will be performed at 30-40% of the arterial occlusion pressure for the upper limb and total duration of 15 minutes. The amount of occlusion pressure will be re-evaluated every two weeks.

Statistical analyses will perform using SPSS program. Descriptive statistics will be presented with means and standard deviations for numerical data and with numbers (n) and percentages (%) for non-numerical data. The suitability of the data obtained from the patients to the normal distribution will be evaluated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In the case of the normal distribution of data, comparisons between groups will be tested using repeated-measures analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA). When the parametric test conditions are not met, before-after differences within the group will be calculated and the Mann Whitney U test will be used in the analysis of the differences between the groups. Wilcoxon test will be used in intra-group comparisons before and after treatment. In all analyzes, the significance value will be determined as p=0.05.","Inclusion Criteria:

Blood samples were collected from septic patients at the intensive care unit (ICU) at three time points (T1-3): T1: within 12h after admission; T2: second day morning; T3: third day morning. Sampling points for non-septic ICU patients were T1 and T3. Exclusion criteria were patients under 18 years of age, unobtainable consent, end-stage renal disease requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation and patients with malignancies needing palliative care. Not more than one sample (venous blood) was collected from control patients. Plasma presepsin levels were determined by an automated chemiluminescence-based Point of Care instrument while serum gelsolin levels were measured using an automated immune turbidimetric assay. Plasma presepsin concentrations were expressed as pg/mL, while serum gelsolin levels were expressed as mg/L. Data were compared with laboratory and clinical parameters. Patients were categorized by the Sepsis-3 definitions and 10-day mortality data were investigated. Presepsin:gelsolin ratio was evaluated in major sepsis-related organ dysfunctions including hemodynamic disturbances, respiratory insufficiency and acute kidney injury (AKI).","Presepsin is the 13-kDa soluble N-terminal fragment of the 55-kDa cluster of differentiation (CD) marker protein CD14, which is the receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein complexes. CD14 is a glycoprotein expressed mostly on the membrane surface of macrophages, monocytes and granulocytes which is released and degraded during inflammation after the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), thus probably resulting in earlier elevation of plasma presepsin (PSEP) levels than the conventional sepsis biomarkers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin). There is a growing body of evidence indicating increasing PSEP levels as kidney function decreases (e.g. during chronic kidney disease or sepsis-related AKI). Gelsolin (GSN) is a multifunctional protein existing in three different isoforms. Secreted or plasma GSN (MW = 83 kDa) is an essential component of the so-called extracellular actin scavenger system, therefore, decreasing serum GSN levels were reported in various clinical conditions (e.g. severe sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), extensive trauma, acute liver failure, myocardial infarction). As albumin levels also tend to decrease in severe catabolic conditions, the simultaneous measurement of PSEP and GSN could prove to be useful regarding the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis and sepsis-related organ dysfunction.

"Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland",OTHER,NCT02499484,Topical Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN) and Eccentric Exercises in the Treatment of Midportion Achilles Tendinopathy,The Use of Topical Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN) and Eccentric Exercises in the Treatment of Midportion Achilles Tendinopathy: a Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial,"The primary objective of this research is to determine if the addition of topical GTN over 24 weeks to a 12 week exercise programme improves clinical outcomes more than placebo GTN for people with Achilles Tendinopathy.

Pain in the Achilles tendon is a common condition seen by physiotherapists and doctors. It affects people involved in sports and those who are not. It can limit the ability to walk, hop, jump and run. If the pain persists for longer than 3 months it can become extremely difficult to abolish. As a result, people with this common condition can suffer from prolonged pain and often the pain will persist and affect everyday activities.

While this is an easy injury to diagnose, it is not so easy to treat. Many treatments do exist, but often just provide short-term relief until the pain returns. Specific strengthening exercises have been shown to be beneficial in treating this condition.

The current project will study Achilles tendon pain in Irish adults at Connolly Hospital, Dublin, and will take place from 2015 to 2019. In this study, there are two groups of patients. Both groups will perform an exercise program for 12 weeks. Physiotherapists will instruct them on how to perform the exercises. Each group will be given an ointment to place on the sore tendon using an applirule. This ointment will be applied daily for 6 months. One group will use an ointment containing nitroglycerin, the other group will use an ointment with no active ingredient. This is called a placebo. The patients will apply the ointment daily for 6 months.

The patients will be assessed at the start of the program and after 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Our main question is to see whether this exercise program when combined with a nitroglycerin ointment applied directly over the sore tendon can improve the outcomes and recovery time for people who suffer with Achilles tendon pain.","Study Design

The study will be designed to meet CONSORT guidelines. A randomized placebo controlled trial will be carried out at the Physiotherapy Department of Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15. The study will be conducted on patients who present to the department with a diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy. The diagnosis will be confirmed based on a history of an insidious onset of Achilles tendon pain, a tender nodule/thickening of the tendon to the region 2 to 6cm from the calcaneal insertion, and an ultrasound examination that excludes a frank tear.

Participants will be randomly allocated to one of 2 groups. Group 1 will receive GTN for 24 weeks in combination with a supervised eccentric exercise programme delivered over 12 weeks. Group 2 will receive placebo GTN in addition to the same exercise programme.

Ethical Considerations Ethics approval will be sought from Connolly Hospital Research and Ethics Committee. All participants will give written informed consent.

At the patient's initial assessment, the following will be completed

* Outcome measure questionnaires - Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), Numeric Rating Scale for pain (NRS)
* Assessment of Achilles tendon tenderness using pressure algometry
* Ultra-sound assessment of the Achilles tendon - tendon thickness measurements
* Proprioception testing (modified Star Excursion Balance Test)
* Simple strength tests of the Achilles, Hopping and heel raises

It is anticipated that the baseline assessment will take 60-75 minutes to complete. The follow-up assessment should take no more than 45 minutes to complete.

Outcome Measures All outcomes will be administered at baseline, and at week 6, 12 and 24 by the principal investigator. Data on adverse effects, compliance with the ointment application and the exercise program will be recorded at these scheduled visits.

Upon completion of the initial assessment by the principal investigator, participants will be scheduled to have their first exercise intervention session with one of the physiotherapists in Connolly Hospital. The treating physiotherapists will be trained in the exercise protocol and will be blinded to the type of GTN provided to the patient. This appointment will be scheduled within one week of the lead investigator's assessment. This tendon rehabilitation program is designed to encompass current methods of non-operative treatment of Achilles tendinopathy (Paoloni et al, 2004) and will involve the following:

* Instruction in performance of the Alfredson heavy load eccentric exercise program.
* Patients will be advised to avoid weight bearing sporting activities for the first 4 to 6 weeks, after which time gradual return to sports will be encouraged. Participation in sports will be continued so long as the pain does not increase above NRS\>3 and no increase in Achilles morning stiffness is experienced.
* Instruction in the performance of daily static stretches of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle groups
* Patients will be advised to avoid the use of co-interventions or complimentary treatments for the duration of the study.

Exercise interventions:

Participants will be instructed on how to perform the Alfredson heavy load eccentric exercise protocol (Alfredson, 1998) by the physiotherapists in Connolly Hospital. This will be performed during their first treatment session, which will take place approximately one week after the initial assessment. The participants will be given practical instructions and a written manual on the exercise program, which will include advice on progression of the exercise regimen.

Topical nitroglycerin ointment (GTN)

The topical GTN to be used for the purpose of this trial is Percutol. This will deliver the GTN in ointment form. Participants will be instructed in how to measure 0.5cm of Percutol ointment by applying 0.5cm of Percutol to a paper applicator/strip, which has the amount required indicated in a circular outline, measuring approximately the same size as a pea. This paper applicator/strip will be placed on a flat surface and the participant will squeeze the ointment onto the paper, carefully measuring the amount specified on the paper applicator. Participants will then place the paper on to the painful area of the Achilles with the ointment contacting the skin, and use the paper to lightly spread the ointment to cover the painful area of the Achilles tendon. The ointment should not be rubbed into the skin. The paper applicator will then be covered with surgical tape to hold the applicator in place. The participants will then replace the cap on the ointment and screw it on tightly and store it as per the instructions (at room temperature and out of reach and sight of children). Participants will be instructed to wash their hands before and after this process. The paper applicator with the Percutol ointment will be placed on the affected area of the Achilles tendon in the morning and left in situ for the daytime, and removed by the participant before sleeping at night. It will be emphasized that the ointment must be on while the participants perform the home exercise program (HEP).

0.5cm of Percutol has been chosen for the purpose of this trial. Aspire Pharma United Kingdom (UK) manufacture Percutol and have informed the PI that 1 inch of Percutol weighs 0.83g approximately and corresponds to 16.64mg of GTN.

The PI has conducted measures of Percutol, 0.5cm of Percutol weighs approximately 0.14 to 0.17g and this corresponds to 2.8 to 3.4mg of GTN.

The placebo to be used for the purpose of this trial will be aqueous cream and therefore will contain no GTN or active ingredient, which would assist in tendon healing. Participants will be instructed to apply the same amount of this placebo ointment in the exact same method as outlined for the GTN group using the same paper/applicator method.

Participants will be instructed in the use of the ointment during their initial visit with the lead investigator. They will be informed that the dosing regimen calls for the ointment to be applied to the painful area of the Achilles tendon and left in situ for 12 to 14 hours and removed at night prior to sleeping. This will then be discarded and replaced with a new measure of the ointment the next day. Participants will be advised to apply the ointment to the site of maximal tenderness within a region of 1-2 cm around this point. The participants will be advised to rotate the paper applicator about the site of maximal tenderness on a regular basis for the six-month duration of the study in an effort to minimize irritation of the skin.","Inclusion Criteria:

Pain in the Achilles tendon is a common condition seen by physiotherapists and doctors. It affects people involved in sports and those who are not. It can limit the ability to walk, hop, jump and run. If the pain persists for longer than 3 months it can become extremely difficult to abolish. As a result, people with this common condition can suffer from prolonged pain and often the pain will persist and affect everyday activities. While this is an easy injury to diagnose, it is not so easy to treat. Many treatments do exist, but often just provide short-term relief until the pain returns. Specific strengthening exercises have been shown to be beneficial in treating this condition. The current project will study Achilles tendon pain in Irish adults at Connolly Hospital, Dublin, and will take place from 2015 to 2019. In this study, there are two groups of patients. Both groups will perform an exercise program for 12 weeks. Physiotherapists will instruct them on how to perform the exercises. Each group will be given an ointment to place on the sore tendon using an applirule. This ointment will be applied daily for 6 months. One group will use an ointment containing nitroglycerin, the other group will use an ointment with no active ingredient. This is called a placebo. The patients will apply the ointment daily for 6 months. The patients will be assessed at the start of the program and after 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Our main question is to see whether this exercise program when combined with a nitroglycerin ointment applied directly over the sore tendon can improve the outcomes and recovery time for people who suffer with Achilles tendon pain. Study Design The study will be designed to meet CONSORT guidelines. A randomized placebo controlled trial will be carried out at the Physiotherapy Department of Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15. The study will be conducted on patients who present to the department with a diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy. The diagnosis will be confirmed based on a history of an insidious onset of Achilles tendon pain, a tender nodule/thickening of the tendon to the region 2 to 6cm from the calcaneal insertion, and an ultrasound examination that excludes a frank tear. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of 2 groups. Group 1 will receive GTN for 24 weeks in combination with a supervised eccentric exercise programme delivered over 12 weeks. Group 2 will receive placebo GTN in addition to the same exercise programme. Ethical Considerations Ethics approval will be sought from Connolly Hospital Research and Ethics Committee. All participants will give written informed consent. At the patient's initial assessment, the following will be completed * Outcome measure questionnaires - Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), Numeric Rating Scale for pain (NRS) * Assessment of Achilles tendon tenderness using pressure algometry * Ultra-sound assessment of the Achilles tendon - tendon thickness measurements * Proprioception testing (modified Star Excursion Balance Test) * Simple strength tests of the Achilles, Hopping and heel raises It is anticipated that the baseline assessment will take 60-75 minutes to complete. The follow-up assessment should take no more than 45 minutes to complete. Outcome Measures All outcomes will be administered at baseline, and at week 6, 12 and 24 by the principal investigator. Data on adverse effects, compliance with the ointment application and the exercise program will be recorded at these scheduled visits. Upon completion of the initial assessment by the principal investigator, participants will be scheduled to have their first exercise intervention session with one of the physiotherapists in Connolly Hospital. The treating physiotherapists will be trained in the exercise protocol and will be blinded to the type of GTN provided to the patient. This appointment will be scheduled within one week of the lead investigator's assessment. This tendon rehabilitation program is designed to encompass current methods of non-operative treatment of Achilles tendinopathy (Paoloni et al, 2004) and will involve the following: * Instruction in performance of the Alfredson heavy load eccentric exercise program. * Patients will be advised to avoid weight bearing sporting activities for the first 4 to 6 weeks, after which time gradual return to sports will be encouraged. Participation in sports will be continued so long as the pain does not increase above NRS\>3 and no increase in Achilles morning stiffness is experienced. * Instruction in the performance of daily static stretches of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle groups * Patients will be advised to avoid the use of co-interventions or complimentary treatments for the duration of the study. Exercise interventions: Participants will be instructed on how to perform the Alfredson heavy load eccentric exercise protocol (Alfredson, 1998) by the physiotherapists in Connolly Hospital. This will be performed during their first treatment session, which will take place approximately one week after the initial assessment. The participants will be given practical instructions and a written manual on the exercise program, which will include advice on progression of the exercise regimen. Topical nitroglycerin ointment (GTN) The topical GTN to be used for the purpose of this trial is Percutol. This will deliver the GTN in ointment form. Participants will be instructed in how to measure 0.5cm of Percutol ointment by applying 0.5cm of Percutol to a paper applicator/strip, which has the amount required indicated in a circular outline, measuring approximately the same size as a pea. This paper applicator/strip will be placed on a flat surface and the participant will squeeze the ointment onto the paper, carefully measuring the amount specified on the paper applicator. Participants will then place the paper on to the painful area of the Achilles with the ointment contacting the skin, and use the paper to lightly spread the ointment to cover the painful area of the Achilles tendon. The ointment should not be rubbed into the skin. The paper applicator will then be covered with surgical tape to hold the applicator in place. The participants will then replace the cap on the ointment and screw it on tightly and store it as per the instructions (at room temperature and out of reach and sight of children). Participants will be instructed to wash their hands before and after this process. The paper applicator with the Percutol ointment will be placed on the affected area of the Achilles tendon in the morning and left in situ for the daytime, and removed by the participant before sleeping at night. It will be emphasized that the ointment must be on while the participants perform the home exercise program (HEP). 0.5cm of Percutol has been chosen for the purpose of this trial. Aspire Pharma United Kingdom (UK) manufacture Percutol and have informed the PI that 1 inch of Percutol weighs 0.83g approximately and corresponds to 16.64mg of GTN. The PI has conducted measures of Percutol, 0.5cm of Percutol weighs approximately 0.14 to 0.17g and this corresponds to 2.8 to 3.4mg of GTN. The placebo to be used for the purpose of this trial will be aqueous cream and therefore will contain no GTN or active ingredient, which would assist in tendon healing.

Some people have allergic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Researchers want to learn more about these reactions to provide guidance on who can safely receive the vaccines, including a second dose in people who had a reaction to the first.

Objective:

To study the safety of giving a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose to people who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose.

Eligibility:

People aged 16-69 who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

Design:

Individuals who have underlying health issues may need to come to the NIH for screening tests to make sure they are safe to receive the vaccine. People who are eligible to participate in the study will be admitted to the NIH hospital and stay for at least 4 days. They will give urine samples. They will have a nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 test. They will have an intravenous line placed in each arm. They will get the study vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) and one dose of placebo on different days. They will have breathing tests. They may have clinical photography if they develop a rash.

Participants will have 4 follow-up visits - 2 by phone and 2 in-person visits at the NIH campus . They will have allergy skin testing at one visit. Drops of different allergens or controls will be placed on their back or arm. The skin under each drop will be scratched with a tool. If the results are negative, a small amount of allergen will be injected just below the surface of their skin. Participants who have no or only a mild allergic reaction to the second dose of the vaccine may be eligible to receive a Booster dose at the NIH.

Participation will last for approximately 5 months.","Study Description:

"University of California, Los Angeles",OTHER,NCT03557684,Leucine for Depression Study (L-DEP),An Experimental Treatment Approach for Inflammation-Induced Depression,"Depression is very common and poses a huge disease burden. About 20% of the US population suffers from depression at lease once in their lifetime. Inflammations that are hidden inside our body as a result of aging, obesity, chronic diseases, or certain treatments (e.g., interferon for hepatitis C) appear to cause depressive symptoms and even clinical depression. Individuals with such inflammations are more likely to suffer from depression and are less likely to respond to currently available antidepressant medications. This study will test leucine, an amino acid, as a new way to mitigate depressive symptoms in response to such inflammations. This study begins with a 90-minute screening session to determine whether participants are eligible to join the main study. Those who meet the eligibility criteria will then join the main study, which will consist of taking leucine or maltodextrin (i.e., oral placebo) for 2 weeks at home and an 8-hour session at the UCLA Medical Center. A brief telephone follow-up every 3 months for 2 years with questions on mood is also planned. Approximately 90 healthy adults will be recruited for participation in the study. During the course of the study, participants will take leucine or maltodextrin for 2 weeks at home and then will be injected either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline (i.e., intravenous placebo) at the UCLA Medical Center. LPS is a bacterial substance that can initiate chemical reactions that are similar to those seen in individuals with mild sickness symptoms, such as a slight increase in body temperature, muscle aches, or tiredness. It is a safe way of investigating the body's response to inflammation and how these changes may alter cognitive, emotional, or neural function.

Recent research has shown that type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome may be prevented or delayed by making lifestyle changes. A primary care practice will enroll participants who will choose either the GLB-DVD intervention or face-to-face group delivery. Approximately 25 patients will be recruited in each group. It is not known if the GLB intervention delivered via DVD is similarly effective to face-to-face group delivery for people with metabolic syndrome or pre-diabetes. It is hoped that this research study will provide information to help answer that question.,"The Group Lifestyle Balance program is a 12-session lifestyle intervention with the same goals for weight loss and physical activity as the successful Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention and has been evaluated in several settings. The DPSC collaborated with the US Air Force Center of Excellence for Medical Multimedia to create a DVD of the GLB. The GLB-DVD is a series of taped sessions of a staged group following a script that was developed to closely follow the program.

Effectiveness was assessed for the intervention delivered via DVD (GLB-DVD) as well as traditionally in a group setting (GLB-GROUP). For each delivery mode, pre- and 3 month post-intervention measures of weight and the achievement of the program goals were assessed. Secondary outcomes measured included assessment of components of the metabolic syndrome (NCEP ATP III) and HbA1c.

The prevention professionals in the practice and the Diabetes Prevention Support Center (DPSC) who provided support for the GLB-DVD and GLB-GROUP participants were health care professionals trained in delivery of the GLB by the DPSC faculty. Group delivery of the GLB was conducted via weekly in person, meetings delivered over 12-15 weeks. For GLB-DVD delivery, an overview of the GLB-DVD and materials was provided at commencement of the intervention. Participants were instructed to view one session/week. At the end of each month the participant was asked to return their DVD via postage-paid mail to the DPSC and the next sequential DVD was mailed to the participant.

In non-endemic industrialized areas, imported malaria is generally diagnosed in travelers, as well as immigrants from endemic countries. Such imported cases have increased worldwide, with approximately 7000 cases each year in France. Among these cases, 300 are severe requiring hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) with an overall mortality rate of 10%, despite available effective care.

Many studies have been performed to evaluate clinical and physiopathological aspects of severe malaria in endemic areas but few data are available for imported malaria.

Among these cases, 300 are severe requiring hospitalization in ICU with an overall mortality rate of 10%, despite available effective care.

Rudy Reindl,OTHER,NCT00597779,Randomized Comparison of 2 Fixation Techniques for Unstable Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures,Extramedullary vs. Intramedullary Devices in the Treatment of Unstable Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures,"The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and radiological outcome of patients that are treated with two different orthopedic implants. The study population will consist of patients that have sustained unstable hip fractures. The two different implants will be randomly assigned.

The null hypothesis states that there should not be any significant differences between the two implants.","Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common injuries in the elderly population. They often signify generalized physical deterioration. Operative management has become the standard of care to prevent life threatening complications and dates back to the 1940's. The design of implants has evolved significantly since then.

The sliding hip screw replaced static fixation of the femoral head in the 1950's. As a result of this improvement in design, failures have been reduced to 9-16%. The sliding hip screw allows for stable collapse of the femoral neck. This can lead to significant shortening of the proximal femur in comminuted fractures.

Current treatment modalities focus on obtaining a satisfactory union of the fracture, often at the expense of anatomical alignment. Severely comminuted fractures treated with a standard plate-hip-screw device thus commonly result in significant degrees of mal-union and shortening. In the past, implants designed to restore and maintain the anatomy of the hip have resulted in high failure rates with the implant breaking out of the femoral head. In the mid 1980's, recognition of this led to the development of various intramedullary devices for fixation of these fractures. The weight-bearing portion of the implant is therefore shifted medially, resulting in reduced lever forces on the implant and femur. Additionally, the IM device does not rely on fixation to the lateral cortex of the femur with screws. From a biomechanical standpoint, the intramedullary device has distinct advantages, as it is a load- sharing device more closely located to the axis of weight bearing than the plate-hip-screw device.

Advances in intramedullary designs have been promising, but the clinical results variable. The relatively high rate of fracture at the tip, specifically at the level of the locking bolts, has hampered the widespread popularity of intramedullary devices. Additionally, the large diameter of the proximal aspect of the implants required extensive reaming of the greater trochanter and partial detachment of the gluteus medius. This may lead to abductor weakness and a Trendelenburg gait. Some studies have found increased re-operation rates for these early hip-nail devices compared to the plate -hip-screw implant. Other studies have shown decreased blood loss and operative time with the nails. A meta-analysis of the literature favors the sliding hip screw design. Unfortunately, most studies focus on radiological failure rate rather than patient function and relate to the first generation of IM devices.

The newest generation of nails (like the IM studied here) has attempted to correct the shortcomings of earlier designs. The proximal aspect of the nail diameter is minimized. The distal locking screw is located far away from the distal end of the nail and the locking bolt is placed in an oblique fashion. Design alterations to the femoral head fixation portion of the nail by using a helical blade rather than a screw may improve fixation in the femoral head. These new designs seem to compare favorably in recent clinical tests. Early mobilization for patients with the intramedullary device (IM) seems to be better.

Results of the pilot study indicate an earlier return to full mobility and shorter operating time in the IM group. This study included all intertrochanteric fracture types and did not demonstrate a clear benefit of the IM in many other parameters. The currently proposed multi-centre study will focus on the unstable A2 intertrochanteric fracture pattern.

Considering the significantly increased cost of the new intramedullary devices compared to the standard plate-hip-screw, a significant overall improvement in patient function should be realized before the general use of these new devices could be recommended.","Inclusion Criteria:

However, fentanyl can cause postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), which is a main target side effect that medical staff strives to prevent. However, recent meta-analysis showed that the incidence of PONV may be different depending on the time of administration of fentanyl. However, the research design of patients enrolled in each study, such as the age, the name of the operation, and the method of anesthesia, is not identical.

VA Boston Healthcare System,FED,NCT00350584,Evaluation of Telehealth Interventions for Post-Trauma Stress,Evaluation of Two Telehealth Interventions Targeting Post-Trauma Stress in Combat Veterans: Comparing Mindfulness and Psychoeducation,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is very prevalent within the veteran population and is associated with decreased quality of life and an increased risk of developing other psychiatric and physical illnesses. The overarching objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two telehealth treatment conditions in promoting healing within a population of veterans with full or partial PTSD. In particular, we are targeting newly returned veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. Specifically, we are comparing the relative efficacy of an alternative therapeutic approach, a Mindfulness based treatment, with a Psychoeducation treatment in reducing symptoms of PTSD and more generalized psychiatric symptoms, while increasing quality of life. Of note, both treatment conditions will consist of two in-person sessions and six brief weekly telephone calls. Participants will be 58 veterans (29 per condition) recruited from the VA Boston Healthcare System. Assessment will occur before and after the delivery of the intervention. We hypothesize that while both treatments will result in improved outcomes, the Mindfulness intervention will promote more healing than the Psychoeducation intervention. Results from this project will help further our understanding of the role of mindfulness in treating PTSD, particularly in those veterans who are returning from deployment.","Aim: To evaluate the relative feasibility and healing efficacy of two eight-week telehealth interventions for individuals with combat-related PTSD: (1) Mindfulness and (2) Psychoeducation.

Objectives:

1. The first short-term objective is to determine whether two eight-week telehealth interventions are:

   1. feasible to conduct in a population of veterans with symptoms of combat-related PTSD;
   2. effective at promoting healing specific to combat survivors as evidenced by reductions in symptoms of PTSD;
   3. effective at promoting more generalized healing in combat veterans as evidenced by reductions in symptoms that are often co-morbid with PTSD (e.g., depression, anxiety, and substance abuse problem severity); and
   4. effective at promoting healing beyond a symptom level in combat veterans as evidenced by increases in quality of life after the interventions.
2. The second short-term objective of this study is to determine whether a Mindfulness intervention will be more effective at promoting healing than a Psychoeducation intervention. This comparison will be made on the levels of specific PTSD symptoms, more general co-morbid symptoms, and global quality of life.
3. The long-term objectives of this line of research are to identify mechanisms of action in a Mindfulness Telehealth Intervention that allow healing and promote increased quality of life in individuals with PTSD.
4. An additional long-term objective of this project is to contribute to the development of efficacious wellness interventions that can promote healing after combat exposure in veterans returning from current military conflicts (e.g. Iraq and Afghanistan).

Hypotheses:

1. It is hypothesized that both eight-week telehealth interventions (Mindfulness and Psychoeducation) will be feasible in a population of veterans with symptoms of combat-related PTSD. Specifically, satisfaction and compliance with the interventions is predicted to be high.
2. It is hypothesized that both eight-week telehealth interventions (Mindfulness and Psychoeducation) will be effective at promoting healing and reducing symptoms of PTSD. Specifically, it is predicted that levels of PTSD measured post-intervention will be lower than levels measured pre-intervention.
3. It is hypothesized that both eight-week telehealth interventions (Mindfulness and Psychoeducation) will be effective at promoting healing and reducing symptoms co-morbid with PTSD. Specifically, it is predicted that levels of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse problem severity measured post-intervention will be lower than levels measured pre-intervention.
4. It is hypothesized that both eight-week telehealth interventions (Mindfulness and Psychoeducation) will be effective at improving quality of life. Specifically, it is predicted that levels of quality of life measured post-intervention will be higher than levels measured pre-intervention.
5. Although it is hypothesized that both eight-week interventions will be effective at healing for veterans with PTSD symptoms, the holistic Mindfulness intervention is hypothesized to be more effective at promoting healing and reducing symptoms of PTSD and co-morbid disorders and improving quality of life than the Psychoeducation intervention. Specifically, it is predicted that levels of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse problem severity will be lower post-intervention and quality of life will be higher for those individuals in the Mindfulness condition than for those in the Psychoeducation condition.","Inclusion Criteria:

Visual consequence of vestibular deficit can lead to a severe impairment of their quality of life. However, correcting saccades during rapid head movement, called covert-saccades, have been more recently identified. These saccades, which occur during the head movement in patients with vestibular hypofunction, present a very short latency. They could compensate for the lack of vestibular-ocular reflex and greatly decrease oscillopsia and visual impairment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential functional benefice of these compensatory movements in a population of 20 patients with chronic bilateral areflexia, in a cross-sectional study.

Accurate tumor localization is of utmost importance as complete resection increases the chance of cure and improves patient outcomes even when cure is not possible. However, finding the primary tumor can be very challenging and, in some cases, impossible. With the recent FDA approval of a PET tracer (Ga-68 DOTATATE) that binds to somatostatin receptors for imaging neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), the investigator's institution has the opportunity to dramatically improve the surgical care for these patients. Therefore, the aim for this study is to develop a molecular image-guided surgery program starting with GI NETs. GI NETs are malignant neoplasms that are increasing in prevalence. NETs cause a variety of debilitating symptoms, and, as a result, contribute substantially to cancer-related morbidity. Since the primary treatment for NET is surgical resection, NETs are an ideal model to launch a comprehensive image-guided surgery program. Many NETs are metastatic at presentation or will develop metastases during their course, and it is difficult to identify all disease visually and through manual palpation. Failure to surgically resect all disease leads to symptoms, metastatic disease, and multiple surgical interventions. Many institutions have recently begun using Ga-68 DOTATATE for PET/CT imaging of NETs, and this same tracer can be used for intra-operative localization of primary NETs as well as metastases. The primary impediment to using Ga-68 DOTATATE for this purpose is the need to develop and validate a high-energy gamma (HEG) probe for detecting NETs during surgery. This study will explore the new PET tracer technology and begin a molecular image-guided surgery program for NETs. This initial paradigm will be used to develop a molecular image guided approach to other cancers.

University of Sao Paulo,OTHER,NCT01033084,Efficacy Study of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to Treat Major Depressive Disorder,"A Factorial, Double-blinded, Randomized Clinical Trial on Major Depressive Disorder Using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation","The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation is an effective treatment for major depression, when compared (and combined) to sertraline and placebo.","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder, with a lifetime prevalence of 15% and an incidence of 5% per year. Its core symptoms include lack of pleasure in daily activities, thoughts of guilt and depressed mood. According to the World Health Organization, MDD is one of the ten most impairing conditions, leading to missing workdays, loss of quality of life and increasing expenses in health care. Besides, about 1% of patients with MDD complete suicide. Moreover, one third of patients with MDD remain depressed after more than two adequate treatments, i.e., they are refractory to conventional antidepressant treatments; also, most treated patients remain with residual symptoms. Therefore, the development of new treatments is necessary. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel, promising technique in the study of several neuropsychiatric conditions.

Transcranial DCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation method in which a low intensity direct current is applied through the skull, with neurophysiologic studies showing that a considerable amount of electrical current reach the brain tissues, vis-à-vis the specified parameters. Thus, the DC could be applied over brain MDD-related areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, thereby leading to neuroplasticity and MDD treatment. Indeed, some pilot studies showed that tDCS might ameliorate depressive symptoms. However, it is necessary to replicate these findings in larger populations to increase the generalizability of the results and to verify the efficacy of the intervention. Our aim is to perform a double blind, randomized, factorial study comparing tDCS and sertraline for MDD treatment, enrolling 120 eligible patients of both genders between 21-65 years not presenting active suicidal ideation. They will be allocated in 4 groups at random to receive active tDCS or sham and sertraline 50mg/day or placebo.

Our primary outcome is the depression rating scores at 6 weeks, measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), 17-itens. In conclusion, our purpose is to perform a clinical tDCS study to verify its efficacy in the treatment of MDD in a sample of patients of several levels of severity and refractoriness.

The investigators also hypothesize that both predefined cofactors and appropriately delivered KI-PCC will predict quality of care.

Aim The aim is to detect gaps in the care of advanced incurable cancer patients. Because in this setting there are no predefined structures, the investigators focus on interventions perceived by the patient.

Methods The investigators' target population are advanced incurable cancer patients in different care settings (oncology clinics, Palliative Care centers, and hospice, varying in size, location (rural, urban) and grade of specialization) representing the heterogeneity of care in Romania. The investigators characterize the population using demographic data (EAPC basic dataset amended by country specific data like family structures and income), and validated tools for patient needs (IPOS, EQ5D). Need for and perceived Key interventions of Palliative Cancer Care (KI-PCC), measured by nurse-patient-interaction, are assessed. These KI-PCC include illness understanding, symptom management, decision making, spirituality, end-of-life-preparation, and network/family support. Further, the investigators collect defined outcome quality indicators (QI) for the integration (quality of death and dying, symptoms, aggressive end-of-life-care, inappropriate anticancer care, ER-visits). In addition, known, associated cofactors (e.g. comorbidities, living situation) are measured. The data collection will be longitudinal with monthly follow-ups for at most six months or until death.

The analysis has three elements. First, the investigators will describe the population. Second, the investigators will map the patient perceived KI-PCC and defined outcome QI. Third, if data show robust after international expert review, the investigators will test the hypothesis that appropriate KI-PCC predict quality of care, measured by QI.

Expected impact The investigators expect that their approach will identify gaps in the integration of oncology and palliative care in their specific settings, focusing, however, mainly on patient and proxy view and backed by available information from outcome QI. The conduct of this protocol might also directly have an influence on patient care.

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK),NIH,NCT00001984,Effectiveness of the Investigational Drug Campath-1H in Preventing Rejection of Transplanted Kidneys,Tolerance Induction Following Human Renal Transplantation Using Treatment With a Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Against CD52 (Campath-1H),"This protocol will test a humanized monoclonal antibody known as Campath-1H for its ability to induce a state of permanent allograft acceptance, or tolerance, when administered in combination with a brief course of the immunosuppressive drug deoxyspergualin (DSG) at the time of human renal allotransplantation. Campath-1H is specific for the common lymphocyte and monocyte antigen CD52. Its administration temporarily depletes mature lymphocytes and some monocytes without altering neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells. Deoxyspergualin inhibits the NFkB pathway thus preventing monocyte and macrophage activation.

Recipients of living or cadaveric donor kidneys will be treated with one dose of Campath-1H prior to transplantation to insure that peripheral depletion is achieved at the time of graft reperfusion. Three subsequent doses of Campath-1H will be administered on the first, third and fifth days after the transplant to deplete passenger donor leukocytes and residual recipient cells that mobilize in response to the allograft. In addition, patients will be treated with DSG for 14 days beginning on the day prior to surgery. This trial expands on pilot studies at the NIH of 15 patients in which Campath was given alone at the time of transplantation. In those studies, excellent peripheral depletion occurred after just one dose of Campath though central depletion required additional dosing. This allowed for greatly reduced immunosuppression to be used to prevent rejection, but to date, all patients have required some immunosuppressive medication. It is hoped that the addition of DSG will eliminate the need for long-term immunosuppression.

Patients will be followed closely in the post transplant period. If patients experience rejection, they will be treated with methylprednisolone and have immunosuppression added using sirolimus as the predominant immunosuppressive agent. In the previous phase of this study without DSG, this maneuver has in all cases been successful in returning the allograft to normal function.

In addition to evaluating graft function following transplantation, this protocol will also characterize and evaluate the function of the immune system and the composition of the T cell repertoire following the administration of Campath-1H and DSG, and during immune system recovery after transplantation.","This protocol will test a humanized monoclonal antibody known as Campath-1H for its ability to induce a state of permanent allograft acceptance, or tolerance, when administered in combination with a brief course of the immunosuppressive drug deoxyspergualin (DSG) at the time of human renal allotransplantation. Campath-1H is specific for the common lymphocyte and monocyte antigen CD52. Its administration temporarily depletes mature lymphocytes and some monocytes without altering neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells. Deoxyspergualin inhibits the Rel-B/ NFkB pathway thus preventing monocyte and macrophage activation. Extensive preliminary data have been accumulated in humans using Campath-1H and its non-humanized predecessors. Additionally, data have been generated using a similar depleting scheme with and without DSG in non-human primates. Both the human and non-human primate data suggest that profound mature mononuclear cell depletion establishes a window of opportunity during which foreign tissue can be transplanted without the need for additional immunosuppression. Regulatory events occuring during mature cell repopulation in the presence of allografted tissue created a state in which the graft may not be rejected even in the absence of chronic immunosuppression.

Recipients of living or cadaveric donor kidneys will be treated with one dose of Campath-1H prior to transplantation to insure that peripheral depletion is achieved at the time of graft reperfusion. Three subsequent doses of Campath-1H will be administered on the first, third and fifth days after the transplant to deplete passenger donor leukocytes and residual recipient cells that mobilize in response to the allograft. In addition, patients will be treated with DSG 4mg/kg/d x 1 beginning on day 12 and then 2.5 mg/kg/d for an additional 13 days. This trial expands on pilot studies at the NIH of 17 patients in which Campath was dosed both prior to and after transplantation with and without DSG. In those studies, excellent peripheral depletion occured after just one dose of Campath though central depletion required additional dosing. Thus, the goal of pre-reperfusion depletion can be achieved with a single pre-operative dose but thorough depletion requires additional post-operative dosing. Lasting rejection-free survival was not realized without the addition of some, albeit reduced immunosuppression. This is thought to be due to residual post-operative monocytes that infiltrated the allograft causing modest reversible allograft dysfunction. The current dosing regimen with DSG is thus designed to accomplish both pre-operative depletion, and more thorough post operative elimination of donor and recipient cells mobilizing as a result of reperfusion, combined with therapy aimed at preventing the activation of monocytes that escape depletion. The timing of the DSG is meant to correspond with the peripheral repopulation of monocytes seen in previous patients.

Patients will be followed closely in the post transplant period for evidence of a detrimental immune response to the allograft. In the previous patients experiencing graft directed immunity the graft dysfunction was preceded by a rise in activated monocytes in the peripheral blood and augmented transcription of the cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a) in the allograft. This syndrome has been resistant to treatment with the TNF-a sequestrant Infliximab and is now thought to require more comprehensive monocyte directed therapy. If patients progress and graft dysfunction occurs, patients will be treated with methylprednisolone and have immunosuppression added using sirolimus as the predominant immunosuppressive agent. This maneuver has in all cases been successful in returning the allograft to normal function. Sirolimus has been chosen since it does not act by interfering with specific T cell receptor function, and thus, provides immunosuppressive coverage during cell repopulation without interfering with the antigen specific T cell events important for tolerance induction. Non-human primate and human clinical data support both of these approaches.

In addition to evaluating graft and patient outcome following transplantation, this protocol will also characterize and evaluate the function of the immune system and the composition of the T cell repertoire following the administration of Campath-1H and DSG, and during immune system recovery after transplantation.","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Campath-1H is specific for the common lymphocyte and monocyte antigen CD52. Its administration temporarily depletes mature lymphocytes and some monocytes without altering neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells. Deoxyspergualin inhibits the NFkB pathway thus preventing monocyte and macrophage activation. Recipients of living or cadaveric donor kidneys will be treated with one dose of Campath-1H prior to transplantation to insure that peripheral depletion is achieved at the time of graft reperfusion. Three subsequent doses of Campath-1H will be administered on the first, third and fifth days after the transplant to deplete passenger donor leukocytes and residual recipient cells that mobilize in response to the allograft. In addition, patients will be treated with DSG for 14 days beginning on the day prior to surgery. This trial expands on pilot studies at the NIH of 15 patients in which Campath was given alone at the time of transplantation. In those studies, excellent peripheral depletion occurred after just one dose of Campath though central depletion required additional dosing. This allowed for greatly reduced immunosuppression to be used to prevent rejection, but to date, all patients have required some immunosuppressive medication. It is hoped that the addition of DSG will eliminate the need for long-term immunosuppression. Patients will be followed closely in the post transplant period. If patients experience rejection, they will be treated with methylprednisolone and have immunosuppression added using sirolimus as the predominant immunosuppressive agent. In the previous phase of this study without DSG, this maneuver has in all cases been successful in returning the allograft to normal function. In addition to evaluating graft function following transplantation, this protocol will also characterize and evaluate the function of the immune system and the composition of the T cell repertoire following the administration of Campath-1H and DSG, and during immune system recovery after transplantation. This protocol will test a humanized monoclonal antibody known as Campath-1H for its ability to induce a state of permanent allograft acceptance, or tolerance, when administered in combination with a brief course of the immunosuppressive drug deoxyspergualin (DSG) at the time of human renal allotransplantation. Campath-1H is specific for the common lymphocyte and monocyte antigen CD52. Its administration temporarily depletes mature lymphocytes and some monocytes without altering neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells. Deoxyspergualin inhibits the Rel-B/ NFkB pathway thus preventing monocyte and macrophage activation. Extensive preliminary data have been accumulated in humans using Campath-1H and its non-humanized predecessors. Additionally, data have been generated using a similar depleting scheme with and without DSG in non-human primates. Both the human and non-human primate data suggest that profound mature mononuclear cell depletion establishes a window of opportunity during which foreign tissue can be transplanted without the need for additional immunosuppression. Regulatory events occuring during mature cell repopulation in the presence of allografted tissue created a state in which the graft may not be rejected even in the absence of chronic immunosuppression. Recipients of living or cadaveric donor kidneys will be treated with one dose of Campath-1H prior to transplantation to insure that peripheral depletion is achieved at the time of graft reperfusion. Three subsequent doses of Campath-1H will be administered on the first, third and fifth days after the transplant to deplete passenger donor leukocytes and residual recipient cells that mobilize in response to the allograft. In addition, patients will be treated with DSG 4mg/kg/d x 1 beginning on day 12 and then 2.5 mg/kg/d for an additional 13 days. This trial expands on pilot studies at the NIH of 17 patients in which Campath was dosed both prior to and after transplantation with and without DSG. In those studies, excellent peripheral depletion occured after just one dose of Campath though central depletion required additional dosing. Thus, the goal of pre-reperfusion depletion can be achieved with a single pre-operative dose but thorough depletion requires additional post-operative dosing. Lasting rejection-free survival was not realized without the addition of some, albeit reduced immunosuppression. This is thought to be due to residual post-operative monocytes that infiltrated the allograft causing modest reversible allograft dysfunction. The current dosing regimen with DSG is thus designed to accomplish both pre-operative depletion, and more thorough post operative elimination of donor and recipient cells mobilizing as a result of reperfusion, combined with therapy aimed at preventing the activation of monocytes that escape depletion. The timing of the DSG is meant to correspond with the peripheral repopulation of monocytes seen in previous patients. Patients will be followed closely in the post transplant period for evidence of a detrimental immune response to the allograft. In the previous patients experiencing graft directed immunity the graft dysfunction was preceded by a rise in activated monocytes in the peripheral blood and augmented transcription of the cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a) in the allograft. This syndrome has been resistant to treatment with the TNF-a sequestrant Infliximab and is now thought to require more comprehensive monocyte directed therapy. If patients progress and graft dysfunction occurs, patients will be treated with methylprednisolone and have immunosuppression added using sirolimus as the predominant immunosuppressive agent. This maneuver has in all cases been successful in returning the allograft to normal function. Sirolimus has been chosen since it does not act by interfering with specific T cell receptor function, and thus, provides immunosuppressive coverage during cell repopulation without interfering with the antigen specific T cell events important for tolerance induction. Non-human primate and human clinical data support both of these approaches. In addition to evaluating graft and patient outcome following transplantation, this protocol will also characterize and evaluate the function of the immune system and the composition of the T cell repertoire following the administration of Campath-1H and DSG, and during immune system recovery after transplantation. * INCLUSION CRITERIA: Candidates for a kidney transplant performed at the Warren G.

ES events An ES event was identified as a rapid increase in impedance which precedes a drop in impedance to 50% of baseline beginning in the proximal channel and preceding in an anterograde direction to the most distal channel, followed by the recovery of baseline values at each channel.13 The ES events detected by MII/pH were grouped into mealtime events (the first nine consecutive ES events with no artifacts after the beginning of the meal) and postprandial period events (all the ES events detected in the 3 hours following the end of the meal).

ES event frequency (ES events/hour) was measured, along with the following ES event characteristics:

bolus presence time (BPT): time between bolus entrance and exit recorded in the distal channel, measured in seconds; bolus head advancing time (BHAT): time between the bolus entrance recorded in the proximal channel and the bolus entrance recorded in the distal channel, measured in seconds; bolus head advancing time corrected (BHATc): BHAT corrected for esophageal length, expressed in seconds/cm. BHATc was calculated using the formula BHATc = BHAT / esophageal length where esophageal length is the distance between proximal and distal impedance channels, measured in cm.

GER events

A GER event was defined as a retrograde drop in impedance to 50% of baseline, beginning in the most distal channel and proceding to one or more proximal channels, of at least 5 seconds, followed by an impedance recovery of baseline values.GER event frequency was measured (GER events/hour), along with the following event characteristics:

Patients were free of pain medications and severe diabetic complications .Patients started alpha lipoic acid (ALA)1800 mg for 4 weeks. Patients with a decrease \>3 points in the TSS were randomly allocated to 600 mg of ALA (ALA group) or no medications (ALA withdrawal) for 16 weeks. In each visit investigators evaluated any change in the TSS and the necessity of rescue medication to control symptoms (mainly pain). At the end of the study investigators compared between ALA and ALA withdrawal groups TSS levels and the frequency of use of rescue medications. Physicians were free to manage glucose to maintain Hba1c close to the ADA target (HbA1c \<7%).,"This trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of Universidad Popular Autónoma del Estado de Puebla, Mexico. All participants provided a written informed consent. Type 2 diabetic patients (according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria) with symptomatic diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) defined as the presence of neuropathic symptoms (pain, paresthesias, or numbness) were invited to participate in this open-label multicenter trial. Inclusion criteria were: total symptom score (TSS) \>7 points, HbA1c\<10%, and serum creatinine \<2 mg/dl. Exclusion criteria were evidence of active cardiovascular disease, malignancy, or any other conditions causing neuropathic pain, use of analgesic, antidepressant, or antiepileptic drugs, or any other medication aimed to relief neuropathic pain. In addition, child-bearing female patients not using any effective birth control method and under surveillance of a board-certified gynecologist were excluded.

Phase 1. All patients meeting inclusion criteria received 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) (Meda Pharma, Germany) orally tid, 30 min after each main meal for 4 weeks. During phase 1, no medication for relief of neuropathic pain was allowed. Each participating site was in charge to maintain glycemic control based on the investigator's judgment attempting that all patients were treated according to the american diabetes association (ADA) guidelines. All patients were seen once a week, and at each site visit, TSS was assessed along with a pill count to ensure drug adherence, presence of adverse events and, if needed, treatment adjustments to maintain glucose levels within the ADA targets. Patients with a TSS reduction \>3 points by the end of phase 1 were selected to proceed with phase 2 of the study. Patients with a decrease \<3 points in TSS or that used other neuropathic pain drugs were excluded from study phase 2.

Phase 2. Patients with a decrease of ≥3 TSS points after phase 1 were randomized to receive 600 mg of ALA orally qd for 16 weeks or ALA withdrawal. Patients were scheduled to visit the clinic every 2-3 weeks for TSS, monofilament and assessment. If needed, the patient was prescribed analgesic rescue medication which was monitored at each visit. Primary endpoint was the change in TSS in the two groups studied in phase 2 and the frequency of use of rescue medications Neurological examination was performed at baseline and after phase 1 and 2 including the monofilament test, vibration perception threshold (VPT), and ankle reflexes. A 10g nylon monofilament (Thio-Feel ® Meda Pharma, Germany) was applied to four anatomical sites in each foot (1st, 3rd and 5th metatarsal heads and plantar surface of distal hallux) as previously described (correct answer = 1 point, with a maximum of 4 points in each foot). Eight correct answers were considered normal, 1-7 correct answers indicated reduced monofilament sensation, while absent sensation was assumed if no answer was correct.

At the end of the study investigators compared between ALA and ALA withdrawal groups TSS levels and the frequency of use of rescue medications. Physicians were free to manage glucose to maintain Hba1c close to the ADA target (HbA1c \<7%). This trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of Universidad Popular Autónoma del Estado de Puebla, Mexico. All participants provided a written informed consent. Type 2 diabetic patients (according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria) with symptomatic diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) defined as the presence of neuropathic symptoms (pain, paresthesias, or numbness) were invited to participate in this open-label multicenter trial.

All patients meeting inclusion criteria received 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) (Meda Pharma, Germany) orally tid, 30 min after each main meal for 4 weeks. During phase 1, no medication for relief of neuropathic pain was allowed. Each participating site was in charge to maintain glycemic control based on the investigator's judgment attempting that all patients were treated according to the american diabetes association (ADA) guidelines. All patients were seen once a week, and at each site visit, TSS was assessed along with a pill count to ensure drug adherence, presence of adverse events and, if needed, treatment adjustments to maintain glucose levels within the ADA targets. Patients with a TSS reduction \>3 points by the end of phase 1 were selected to proceed with phase 2 of the study. Patients with a decrease \<3 points in TSS or that used other neuropathic pain drugs were excluded from study phase 2. Phase 2. Patients with a decrease of ≥3 TSS points after phase 1 were randomized to receive 600 mg of ALA orally qd for 16 weeks or ALA withdrawal. Patients were scheduled to visit the clinic every 2-3 weeks for TSS, monofilament and assessment. If needed, the patient was prescribed analgesic rescue medication which was monitored at each visit. Primary endpoint was the change in TSS in the two groups studied in phase 2 and the frequency of use of rescue medications Neurological examination was performed at baseline and after phase 1 and 2 including the monofilament test, vibration perception threshold (VPT), and ankle reflexes.

Psychosocial changes after surgery, including mood fluctuations, interpersonal issues and substance use, have the potential to lower quality of life and interfere with adherence to the postoperative diet and lifestyle, diminishing weight loss outcomes.

This prospective randomized pilot trial will evaluate the effect of a postoperative support program targeting quality of life, psychosocial functioning and adherence to behavior change in Geisinger Health System (GHS) bariatric surgery patients.

In this study there will be two arms. The intervention arm will include forty bariatric surgery patients (all procedure types) from the GHS Center for Nutrition and Weight Management (CNWM) who will participate in a four month bi-weekly postoperative behavioral support program to address psychosocial changes after surgery, strategies for postoperative diet and adherence and preventing weight regain. The control arm will include 40 usual care (UC) patients from the same center that completed bariatric surgery within one year.

Both groups will complete two sets of surveys. The first set will be administered at study initiation. The second set will be administered upon completion of the 8 sessions for the intervention group. The control group will also complete surveys during this same timeframe (approximately 4-6 months after baseline survey completion).

Upon study completion, control group members will be afforded an opportunity to participate in the same postoperative behavioral support program offered to the intervention group.

"University Hospital, Toulouse",OTHER,NCT02779179,Therapeutic Management of Periodontitis and Clinical Manifestations of Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Efficacy of Therapeutic Management of Periodontitis on the Clinical Manifestations of Rheumatoid Arthritis: the Randomized, Controlled ESPERA Trial.","Although RA pathomechanisms remains incompletely understood, periodontitis and RA share pathogenic features : genetic and environmental influences, chronic inflammatory disease, immunoregulatory imbalance, bacterial factors, persistence of antigen/peptide and clinical factors (conjunctive and hard tissues destruction). Several hypothesis can be evocated : Gram negative bacterial systemic spreading, inflammatory transmitter substance systemic spreading (IL1, IL6, IL17, PGE2), systemic spreading of bacterial degradation products (LPS for example).

Currently Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) might be a susceptibility factor to RA because PG has an enzyme, the peptidylarginine deiminase leading to auto antibodies creation and RA increasing. As periodontitis, RA is chronic disease with a cyclic increase evolution, needing a complex pluridisciplinary treatment approach. Recent studies have reported an increased prevalence of RA patients with periodontal disease. Others studies show that periodontal treatment induces a significant decrease of the sedimentation rate and of the DAS28. Periodontitis is suspected to be an independent, aggravating factor in patients with RA (given the definition from NIH : an aggravating factor is something that makes a condition worse). So periodontal treatment cannot be considered as a RA treatment per se. But it is hypothesised that treating periodontitis in RA patients showing signs of periodontitis could result in improvement in RA disease activity. To date the role of periodontitis as an aggravating factor in these patients remains unclear, and only RCT designs can reasonably be used to test this causal hypothesis. There still remains some RA patients who have persistent symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite specialist care and continuous treatment, so results of treating aggravating factors are needed.

Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center,OTHER,NCT02063984,Behavioral Treatment of Adolescent Substance Use,Behavioral Treatment of Adolescent Marijuana Use,"This study will continue research designed to improve treatment outcomes for adolescent substance use disorders by integrating neuroscience- and behaviorally-based treatments. In particular, this project will be the first to evaluate whether Working Memory Training can enhance cognitive function and reduce impulsive decision making to improve abstinence outcomes. In addition, an adaptive abstinence-based incentive program will be evaluated as a new method for intervening with those who do not respond to their first-line treatment.","The study will test two novel strategies to enhance outcomes. Working Memory Training (WMT), an efficacious method for strengthening specific cognitive processes, aims to improve factors (e.g., delay discounting / impulsive decision-making) that have shown a strong relation to substance use and treatment response. Second, more intensive and higher magnitude CM (ICM) will be used to motivate abstinence among teens who are not abstinent by Week 4. The investigators hypothesize that these strategies will improve outcomes by modifying a fundamental cognitive system involved in making choices to engage in risky behavior and by increasing motivation to abstain in early nonresponders. Aim 1 will pilot and refine the new procedures in a community clinic in preparation for the randomized trial. A sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) will allow the study to determine the most effective first-line treatment and the most effective adaptive strategy (Aim 2). All teens will begin treatment with CM or CM/WMT. After 4 weeks, responders will continue in their first-line treatments, while nonresponders will be randomized to ICM or to continue with first-line treatment. Aim 3 will conduct mechanistic analyses to assess whether cognitive changes related to WMT engender increased abstinence, and whether specific tailoring variables moderate treatment effects. Aim 4 will gather formative data on implementation factors to inform future large-scale studies and dissemination efforts. Primary hypotheses are: (1) first-line treatment with WMT will improve abstinence outcomes and reduce relapse; (2) strategies with ICM for nonresponders will result in better outcomes than those without; (3) WMT will reduce delay discounting, which will predict outcome.

Family caregivers are more likely than noncaregivers to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, feelings of anger, and health problems. Although there are multiple treatment models to address the adverse mental and physical health outcomes associated with caregiving, most do not account for the specific risk and protective factor differences among caregivers of people with dementia. Such models provide the same treatment to all participants and have demonstrated only limited success in this high-risk caregiver population. An adaptive treatment model based on the Stress Process Model of caregiving, which emphasizes that there are multiple factors that affect stress, social support, and mental health, may better meet the needs of family caregivers. This study will first develop an adaptive treatment model, based on the Stress Process Model, for family caregivers of a person suffering from dementia. The study will then evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the adaptive treatment model in improving negative outcomes in the family caregivers.

This study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will be used to develop an adaptive treatment model and risk report from which tailored treatment will be prescribed to participants in Phase 2. Participants in Phase 1 will attend four 90-minute interviews over 4 months. The first three interviews will be held in the first 3 to 4 weeks of the study and the last will be about 3 months later. In the first interview, participants will be asked about their experiences caring for their relatives, physical and emotional well-being, and ideas on helpful types of assistance. In the second and third interviews, participants will discuss their caregiving situations in more detail and will receive information about programs and services that may help them carry out caregiving activities. During the final interview, participants will again be asked about their experiences caring for their relatives.

Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,OTHER,NCT01308502,A New Nasopharyngeal pH Probe for Diagnosis of Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,A New Nasopharyngeal pH Probe for Diagnosis of Laryngopharyngeal Reflux,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of a minimally invasive nasopharyngeal pH probe for the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) in children with airway compromise; to determine whether it is comparable to the gold standard esophageal pH probe in identifying LPR in this population; and to correlate results of pH testing with validated questionnaires. Our hypothesis is that a nasopharyngeal pH probe is equivalent to an esophageal probe in identifying laryngopharyngeal reflux.,"Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) has been repeatedly linked to upper respiratory symptoms in the pediatric population. Children with LPR may present with laryngomalacia, subglottic stenosis, laryngitis, and vocal cord nodules among other illnesses. Pharyngeal reflux has even been implicated in causing common childhood illnesses such as sinusitis and otitis media. Diagnosing LPR can be difficult, especially in children. Often otolaryngologists depend on a general gestalt to diagnosis LPR. In some cases, physicians rely on a Reflux Symptoms Index (RSI) questionnaire filled out by the caretaker and/or a Reflux Finding Score (RFS) filled out by the practitioner. Others have attempted to use a variety of tools to measure pH in the upper airway and proximal esophagus.

Initial research focused on correlating gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with otolaryngologic illnesses. These studies relied mostly on esophageal pH probes placed at the lower esophageal sphincter. With the realization that extraesophageal reflux or LPR was a separate disease, new methods have developed to quantify it. The dual esophageal pH probe is the current gold standard for measuring LPR as it records pH just above the proximal esophageal sphincter. Conditions such as chronic pediatric sinusitis, otitis media, laryngitis and globus are believed to arise from laryngopharyngeal reflux. Unfortunately, this device fails to identify many patients with LPR who would benefit from treatment, and radiographic studies are limited by their short duration of evaluation and risk of radiation. In addition, the placement of the esophageal pH probe is relatively invasive requiring both sedation and x-rays to confirm placement. Finally, they are difficult to place and maintain in children, necessitating a hospital stay for 24 hours while data is collected. The alternative is empiric treatment with Histamine 2 blockers and/or Protein Pump Inhibitors for an extended course, which has been shown to improve symptoms in many of these patients but is not without risk.

The new Dx-pH nasopharyngeal probe is the only tool available for directly measuring nasopharyngeal pH. It is an exempted class I medical device and is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for general use in the population. The device, manufactured by Respiratory Technology Corporation ISO (ResTech), measures the pH of both liquid and aerosolized droplets. It is positioned posterior to the soft palate and placement is confirmed by visualizing the light-emitting diode (LED) at the tip of the device. It is significantly less invasive than esophageal pH probes, does not require general anesthesia for placement, and can be used in an outpatient setting.

The Dx-pH probe is currently being used clinically in adult and pediatric practices to diagnose and monitor laryngopharyngeal reflux with only limited research supporting its use. A literature review finds only 6 studies that address the Dx-pH probe, of which, only 1 pilot study has been performed in children. This study looked at changes in pH in the trachea of 3 children with chronic tracheostomies. However, to date, no research has been published on the utility of the probe in diagnosing LPR in children. The probe, if effective, would be a valuable tool for diagnosing LPR in the pediatric population because of its limited risk and potential ability to replace more invasive and costly procedures.","Inclusion Criteria:
