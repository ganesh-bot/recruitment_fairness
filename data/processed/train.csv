OTHER,NCT05844579,The ICU LIBERATION Study,ReLatIonship BEtween Implementation of Evidence-based and suppoRtive ICU cAre and ouTcomes of patIents With Acute respiratOry Distress syNdrome,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition associated with hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic causes and results in high mortality. However, the epidemiology and treatment strategy for ARDS may have changed significantly due to the accumulation of a large body of knowledge, following the two-year pandemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) of which the primary manifestation is ARDS. To improve the quality of ICU care that patients receive after admission to the ICU, a variety of academic societies, including the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, are currently developing evidence-based guidelines and consensus guidelines and statements regarding ABCDEF bundles, nutritional therapy, ICU diary. The ABCDEF bundle, nutritional therapy, and ICU diary have been developed and are being promoted for implementation in hospitals around the world. The implementation of evidence-based ICU care is strongly recommended, especially for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who frequently require ventilators to maintain their lives, because their patient outcomes are worse than those who were admitted to ICU with other causes.

However, there is still little evidence on how the quality of ICU care (compliance rate) correlates with patient prognosis and outcomes, and there are currently no clear goals or indicators for the ICU care we should develop.

This study aims to investigate the epidemiology and treatments given to the patients and evaluate the implementation of evidence-based ICU care and its association with the outcomes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to the ICU. The contents of mechanical ventilation settings, respiratory conditions, and the evidence-based ICU care, such as analgesia, sedation, rehabilitation, and nutrition, given to the patients will be collected in a daily basis.

Aim 1: Epidemiology Aim 2: Treatments Aim 3: Evidence-based ICU care Aim 4: ARDS related Post Intensive Care Syndrome","Background:

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition associated with hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic causes with bilateral lung infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT imaging. 10% of all ICU admissions are ARDS patients, and the recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus has dramatically increased the number of ARDS patients in ICUs across the world. The international epidemiological study (2016) reported a mortality rate of 35-46% for ARDS, and this is very high mortality compared to other ICU diseases. Furthermore, ARDS survivors present with many functional impairments, including physical, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunction (Post Intensive Care Syndrome, PICS), and their Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Quality of Life (QOL) are impaired and many other functional impairments have been pointed out. Their inability to get their original life has attracted significant research attention and become a significantly important research topic. Many patients who are unable to return to work due to functional disability require nursing care, and there is concern about the increased burden on the patient, the family supporting the patient, and the social economy. Therefore, the development of effective strategies for patients with ARDS that take into account not only mortality but also functional prognosis is strongly needed.

Recent studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation (low tidal volume and airway pressure control), neuromuscular blocking agents, prone position, noninvasive mechanical ventilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have improved outcomes, including mortality, in patients with ARDS. However, the mortality of patients with ARDS is still as high as 40%. In addition, the complete reintegration ratio of patients with ARDS after 1 year of hospital discharge reported in 2003 was only 50%, and recent reports have shown little progress in this aspect. Strategies to improve outcomes (mortality and functional prognosis) of ARDS patients by improving not only treatment but also the quality of ICU care have become a hot topic in recent years. The previous paper showed that excessive sedation and absolute bed rest for the purpose of ventilation control and rest during intubation in ARDS patients correlated with delirium, prolonged duration of ventilation, and even increased mortality. Therefore, attempts have been explored to improve outcomes for ARDS patients by systematically providing sedation, analgesia, rehabilitation, spontaneous breathing and awaking tests, and delirium management during ICU admission. These attempts, known as the ABCDEF bundle, have been actively recommended by a number of academic societies to be introduced in ICUs as an attempt to improve outcomes of patients with ARDS and promote their reintegration into society. (ABCDEF bundle: A (Assess, prevent, and manage pain), B (Both spontaneous awakening trials (SAT) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT)), C (Choice of analgesia and sedation), D (Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage), E (Early mobility and exercise), F (Family engagement and empowerment)), and even ICU care such as nutritional therapy and ICU diaries have been shown to improve outcomes for ICU patients, including ARDS, and are strongly recommended. (In this study, this ICU care is referred to as evidence-based ICU care.) On the other hand, our research team has reported that the overall implementation rate of these evidence-based ICU care, ABCDEF bundles, nutritional therapy, and ICU diaries in ICU patients is quite low, and the rate is significantly lower in mechanically ventilated patients. The reason for the low implementation rates is thought to be that the ventilator is a major barrier. Although many articles have proposed evidence-based ICU care, there is little evidence as to which of these should be prioritized and which should be combined to maximize patient outcomes. The reason for this may be that there is a lack of evidence on which of these should be prioritized and which should be combined to maximize patient outcomes. Implementation of evidence-based ICU care requires many resources and effort, and it is difficult to implement all of them simultaneously. Therefore, the purpose of this international multicenter study is to investigate the current epidemiology and treatment strategy given to the patients with ARDS after the two-year pandemic of the novel coronavirus, clarify the actual implementation of ICU care for ARDS patients who require ventilators at high frequency, and evaluate how the implementation of evidence-based ICU care is associated with patient outcomes.

Significance of the study This study has the potential to increase the generalizability of the results which will be obtained from all regions of the world, including Asia, Europe, North and South America, Oceania, and Africa. Therefore, the results will potentially contribute to improving patient treatment and outcomes in all regions of the world. Furthermore, the results obtained will provide a detailed picture of the current ICU care given to patients with ARDS in the ICU. The association/correlation analysis between its implementation and patient outcomes will identify the content of ICU care which can maximize improvement in outcomes for ARDS patients. As a result, this study will contribute to the development of ICU care guidelines and thereby improve the outcomes of patients with ARDS. The study will play a significant role in improving outcomes for patients with ARDS worldwide. In addition, the results of this study will serve as basement data for future interventional research.",RECRUITING,,2023-06-01,2031-12-31,2026-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,1000,ESTIMATED,[],,,0

Health workers are at high risk of COVID-19 infection. Their absence from work dramatically limits the ability to contain the disease. There is currently no vaccine to prevent the disease. Since the introduction to the vaccination schedule of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) live attenuated vaccine directed towards tuberculosis prevention, a decrease in infant mortality has been reported, not related only to tuberculosis. BCG vaccine has been hypothesized to have a non-specific role towards other unrelated pathogens such as viruses that cause airway disease, with reduced morbidity and mortality. In murine as well as in human models it has been shown to decrease the incidence of acute respiratory influenza infections. Likewise, in countries with a high endemicity for tuberculosis, the BCG vaccine reduces the incidence of respiratory infections by up to 80% . In healthy subjects, the BCG vaccine increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytes. Likewise, it increases the epigenetic response, causing an increase in the transcription of genes important in the antimicrobial response, as well as an improvement in cellular function. This is the first national clinical trial to evaluate prospectively the effect that the BCG vaccine offers towards the prevention and reduction of severity in cases of COVID-19.","The study design is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

The changes in pregnancy and preeclampsia increase the risk of difficult intubation. Proper anticipation affects the outcome and enhances safety, especially in critically ill patients. This research aims to assess the superiority of either 2 views or 5 views ultrasound assessment in predictivity of difficult airway (difficult ventilation, laryngoscopy, and intubation) and their comparison to traditional clinical examination by El-Ganzouri Risk Index (EGRI) in critically ill obstetric patients with pre-eclampsia.","Unexpected difficult airway exposes the patient to serious morbidity and even mortality. Obstetrics airway carries the risk of complications due to physiological changes. The airway shows more restriction and changes in preeclamptic patients and peripartum periods. A study reported one incidence of difficult intubation in obstetrics in 20 cases. Inadequate airway management leads to failure in ventilation and oxygenation of the critically ill mother and her fetus.

the Practice Guidelines for Management of the Difficult Airway by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) define the difficult airway as difficult facemask ventilation of the upper airway, difficult tracheal intubation, or both. preoperative assessment of the airway avoids that risk; however, current clinical screening tests have low sensitivity and specificity with limited predictivity.

Ultrasound (US) provides a more precise assessment for tissues like epiglottis, vocal cords, and ring-shaped membranes; thus, it facilitates a bedside, non-invasive objective airway assessment. Moreover, ultrasound assessment can plan and guide airway interventions if needed. The airway in pregnancy goes through changes. a study concluded that The US airway assessment parameters differ significantly between pregnant and non-pregnant patients. Previous studies reported that the best predictors of difficult laryngoscopy and/or difficult intubation were the epiglottis midline-skin distance, hyoid bone-to-skin distance, thyroid cartilage-to-skin distance, thyrohyoid membrane-to-skin distance, and vocal cord anterior commissure-skin distance also predicted difficult airway. In Pregnancy, hyoid bone visibility, and Pre-E/E-VC ratio were independent predictors of the difficult airway.

Researchers suggested different techniques for airway ultrasound. Some suggested detailed technique that allows the determination of multiple parameters. Others suggested a more concise protocol to lessen the time of assessment and to avoid complexity.

This abnormal growth can lead to a variety of reproductive issues, including a higher risk of miscarriage and early pregnancy loss.

While there are treatments available for adenomyosis, they are often limited due to the lack of precise diagnostic criteria. One common approach is the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), which can improve pregnancy rates in infertile women with adenomyosis. However, it's important to note that GnRHa may not restore pregnancy rates to baseline levels.

Another potential treatment option is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). This device releases a hormone called levonorgestrel into the uterus, which can help control the symptoms of endometriosis and adenomyosis. Studies have shown that the endometrial concentration of levonorgestrel from the LNG-IUS is significantly higher than in other tissues like the myometrium, fallopian tubes, and fat tissue.",,COMPLETED,,2023-12-15,2024-07-01,2024-04-10,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,184,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Triptorelin"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""GnRHa will be given as a subcutaneous injection of triptorelin in a dose of 3.75 mg monthly for three months."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system releasing 20 levonorgestrel daily."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""frozen embryo transfer"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""Frozen embryo transfer (FET) where a previously frozen embryo is thawed and transferred into a woman's uterus.\n\nThe FET process involves hormone preparation to prepare the uterus for the transfer, embryo thawing, and the actual transfer of the embryo into the uterus.

OTHER,NCT03633279,Treatment of Sarcopenia Improves the Muscle Mass and Muscle Strength of Patients With Liver Cirrhosis-Child C,Treatment of Sarcopenia Improves the Muscle Mass and Muscle Strength of Patients With Liver Cirrhosis- Child C: A Randomized Double Blind Control Trial,"Sarcopenia is defined as loss of skeletal muscle mass. In cirrhosis, due to impaired urea genesis and decreased hepatic ammonia disposal, the skeletal muscle functions as a metabolic partner for the liver. The proportion of patients with sarcopenia is higher in those with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (80%) compared to cirrhosis due to other etiologies (31%-71%).

Sarcopenia is prevalent in \> 50% patients with Child C cirrhosis. Sarcopenia increases the risk for severe infections in patients with cirrhosis. Adequate amino acid supply is needed for appropriate antibody and cytokine responses, that is impaired when skeletal muscle mass. The sepsis-related mortality rates in patients with and without sarcopenia are 22% and 8%, respectively (P = 0.02). In patients with liver cirrhosis is protein-calorie malnutrition, leading to severe consequences to the general state and clinical evolution of the patient.","Globally, the mortality after any infection in cirrhosis patients is very high. The cumulative mortality in patients with infections was 43.5% (11,987 patients) where as the mortality rate without infection was 13.6% (2317 patients). Over the years, variceal bleeding causing death in cirrhosis has declined substantially but there has been no improvement in infection causing mortality over several decades. It adversely affects clinical outcomes including survival, quality of life, development of other complications.

Radiological image analysis is currently used to diagnose sarcopenia in cirrhosis. The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People and Wilson D et al, recommend using the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (strength or performance) for the diagnosis of sarcopenia.

Cirrhosis is believed to be a state of anabolic resistance and standard replacement of nutrients are generally ineffective.

Patients with cirrhosis frequently show protein and energy deficiency. Protein deficiency leads to hypoalbuminemia, inducing ascites and edema, whereas energy deficiency decreases fat and muscle mass and causes muscle weakness, decreasing the quality of life of patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, in patients with advanced chronic liver disease, Branched Chain Amino acids concentrations are low, whereas the concentrations of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine and tyrosine are high, conditions that may be closely associated with hepatic encephalopathy and the prognosis of these patients. The survival rate of patients with sarcopenia liver cirrhosis has been found to be significantly lower than that of non-sarcopenia cirrhotic patients. Long-term Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation significantly raises the survival rate in sarcopenia liver cirrhosis but not in non-sarcopenia liver cirrhosis showed that sarcopenia was associated with mortality in patients undergoing Live Donor Liver Transplantation, and perioperative nutritional therapy significantly improved overall survival in patients with sarcopenia.

It has been reported that the longer the duration on a waiting list for liver transplantation, the more sarcopenia the patient has become, even though their Model for End-stage Liver Disease scores stay the same. Patients in an advanced state of sarcopenia are confronted by their vulnerability to infection, and ultimately their imminent death. Patients with sarcopenia tended to have postoperative complications, especially infectious complications. Studies differ on the effect of of Sarcopenia on post transplant mortality. Montano-Loza et al reported that patients with ""extreme"" sarcopenia exhibited significantly worse prognosis. Nevertheless, patients with severe sarcopenia must have worse prognoses because of the vulnerability to infectious problems.

The main immunosuppressants used in liver transplant recipients are calcineurin inhibitors. Although liver transplant recipients usually gain weight after transplantation, that gain is mainly caused by the accumulation of fat, while skeletal muscle mass rather decreases. The state of sarcopenia rather worsen after liver transplantation. reported that sarcopenia continued to be a risk factor for mortality even in patients who managed to survive their early post transplant periods. Because sarcopenia continues, or rather worsens in some recipients, after liver transplantation, their vulnerability to infections, frailty syndrome in general, caused by sarcopenia should be seriously cautioned in addition to the problems relating to immunosuppressants.

With regard to nutritional intervention for sarcopenia, Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation is vital because Branched Chain Amino acids are an essential amino acid substrate for protein synthesis and energy generation in skeletal muscles. Branched Chain Amino acids are a group of three essential amino acids comprising valine, leucine and isoleucine; these account for 35% of the essential amino acids in skeletal muscle proteins. In patients with liver cirrhosis, Branched Chain Amino acids is not only a substrate of protein synthesis and ammonia detoxification, but is also a source of energy for the skeletal muscles.

Therefore, the consumption of Branched Chain Amino acids by skeletal muscle is accelerated in Liver Cirrhosis, leading to muscle protein breakdown, and resulting in sarcopenia As an effect on cirrhotic patients, Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation has been demonstrated to improve Protein Energy Malnutrition, raise serum albumin levels, and subsequently improve quality of life and prognosis The possible effect of Branched Chain Amino acids on sarcopenia is that leucine primarily activates the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway involved in muscle protein synthesis, and additionally stimulates the pancreatic β cells to release insulin, which has an anabolic effect in skeletal muscle.

The present study demonstrated that Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation significantly improves the prognosis of sarcopenia liver cirrhosis, but its direct effect on sarcopenia itself remains unknown.

Several clinical trials have suggested that Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation improves the prognosis of cirrhotic patients. For example, a multicenter randomized trial from Italy showed that oral Branched Chain Amino acids supplementation in patients with advanced cirrhosis prevented progressive hepatic failure and improved surrogate markers and perceived health status.

The standard of care for nutrition in patients with liver cirrhosis are as follows - Nutritional recommendations target the optimal supply of adequate substrates related to requirements linked to energy, protein, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins and minerals.

Based on these basic observations, patients with advanced chronic liver disease have been treated clinically with Branched Chain Amino acids-rich medicines, with positive effects.

Branched Chain Amino acids will complement frequent feeding with late evening snacks in reversing muscle loss in cirrhosis. The diet combined with resistance exercises shall increase skeletal muscle mass.

Clinical and laboratory Assessment Complete medical record regarding the cirrhosis, its aetiology, complications and co-morbidities will be noted. Liver Function test, Renal function test, Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio will be recorded. The severity of cirrhosis will be assessed using the Child- Pugh score and the Model of End Stage Liver Disease score.

Testing- Assessment of sarcopenia

Patients will participate in the following 4 procedures to measure sarcopenia:

1. L3 Skeletal Muscle Index Skeletal muscle area derived from a single slice CT has become more easily reproducible, and reduces the radiation exposure required to only 2.6 millisieverts. Measuring cross-sectional muscle area at either the level of the third (L3) or fourth (L4) lumbar vertebrae has been shown to correlate well with total body muscle mass (r = 0.71). When adjusted for patient height to take stature into account it is referred to as skeletal muscle index. Skeletal muscle index will be calculated from Slice-O-matic software, version 5 (Tomovision), Montreal, QC, Canada). Skeletal muscle index has been shown to be of higher accuracy in the diagnosis of sarcopenia in cirrhosis than anthropometry or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning and is now the most commonly employed method in studies investigating sarcopenia in cirrhosis. Diagnostic criteria have been extrapolated from Western cirrhosis populations. Multiple studies in cirrhosis, which have employed this definition, have produced clinically meaningful results and it is increasingly accepted as the most appropriate definition of sarcopenia when using cross-sectional imaging.
2. Muscle strength:It is assessed by grip strength and measured using a Jamar dynamometer. The summary of measures are as follow.

   Posture Subject seated Arm position Shoulders adducted and neutrally rotated, elbow flexed at 90°, forearm in neutral Wrist position Wrist between 0 and 30° of dorsiflexion
3. The participant will be allowed to perform one test trial. After this, three trials followed and the best score was used for analysis. Handgrip strength will be expressed in kilogram's (Kg). Three trials for each hand will be carried out and the highest value for diagnosing sarcopenia.

3. Muscle Performance \[Gait Speed Test (4-metre)\]:

The test can be performed with any patient able to walk 4 meters using the instructions below:

1. Instruct the patient to walk at their normal pace. Patients may use an assistive device, if needed.
2. Ask the patient to walk down a hallway through a 1-metre zone for acceleration, a central 4-metre ""testing"" zone, and a 1-metre zone for deceleration (the patient should not start to slow down before the 4-metre mark).
3. Start the timer with the first footfall after the 0-metre line of the testing zone
4. Stop the timer with the first footfall after the 4-metre line of the testing zone

SCORING: Gait speed of longer than 5 seconds to walk 4 meters (\<0.8 m/s) suggests an increased risk of poor muscle performance.

4. Muscle Performance-The chair stand test is a physical performance test used to assess lower-extremity function. A 5 repetition test is a measure of strength; a 10 repetition test is a measure of strength and endurance. Equipment/Set Up Use a standard chair with arms and with a seat height of approximately 17 inches for all assessments, regardless of the height of the subject. Place the back of the chair against a wall to prevent movement during the test. Procedure Instruct and demonstrate the following protocol before asking the subject to perform the test:

* Sit as far back as possible in the chair seat. Keep feet firmly planted on the floor approximately hip width apart and the back of lower legs away from the chair. Keep knees bent at a 90-degree angle with arms crossed over the chest. (An individual of average or taller height will be able to sit with their upper back against the back of the chair. Individuals of shorter than average height will not be able to touch the chair back while maintaining proper position and are not required to touch the chair back during testing).
* Stand up one time and sit down, returning completely to the correct starting position.
* Indicate that any chair stands done with improper technique, e.g. not standing all the way up, not sitting all the way back, lifting feet off the floor, etc. will not be counted.
* Allow the participant the opportunity to try one chair stand to be sure when they stand up the back of their legs are not touching the chair.
* Instruct the subject that the timed assessment will begin on the command, ""Ready, Set, Go"" and that they are to stand up and sit back down 5 times as quickly and safely as possible. At the command ""Ready, Set, Go"" the tester begins timing by starting the stopwatch.
* Count each chair stand out loud when the subject is in the standing position. Provide continuous verbal encouragement during the test.
* At the tenth repetition click the stopwatch off while participant is in the standing position.
* Conduct two trials, separated by three minutes. If subjects are unable to stand up one time without assistance than they can use their hands to assist them in rising and returning to the seated position while following all other procedures as described above. Make sure to note that hands were used when recording the assessment data.

Normative value of Sarcopenia indices and association of Sarcopenia indices and mortality in child C cirrhosis patients will be also calculated.

Follow up Three months after randomization, data will be collected on the 4 objective indices of sarcopenia, as outlined above.In addition, event free survival, number of hospitalisations, combined liver events (variceal bleeds, ascites , Hepato-renal syndrome, Overt Hepatic encephalopathy, Septic complications - Pneumonias, Urinary Tract Infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, skin infections and septic shock) and Quality of Life (assessed using SF 36 questionnaire) will also be recorded.

Monitoring for Adverse Events:

Branched Chain Amino acids did not increase the risk of serious adverse events, but was associated with nausea and diarrhoea. Any adverse event will be recorded specifying the time of onset, the duration, the severity and the relationship to the test medication.

Sample size: The primary objective is to show the superiority of Branched Chain Amino acids (experimental arm) versus placebo to improve both the muscle mass and muscle strength (co-primary endpoint) after 3 month of treatment in patients with sarcopeniacirrhosis (Child C) treated with standard nutrition and exercises. The co-primary endpoint is the 3-month change in CT Skeletal muscle index and Hand Grip Strength (i.e difference between the baseline and 3 month values). The study success will be only declared if both primary endpoints are statistically significant in favor of the experimental arm at two-sided significant level of 0.05. The sample size will determined as the maximum value of the sample sizes separately calculated for each endpoint with a 90% power for each comparison (considering independence between the two primary outcome as conservative approach) in order to guarantee a power of 0.80 to show the treatment efficacy on both primary outcomes. As analyzing the changes or values at 3 months are equivalent since the primary analysis will be adjusted for baseline values,Investigator determined the sample size using the 3-month values for each primary endpoints obtained in a study carried out in our center. In control arm, Investigator expect a mean CT Skeletal muscle index of 45.4±5.9 at 3-months and Mean Hand Grip Strength of 33.7+9. Compared to placebo Investigator expect that Branched Chain Amino acids will be associated with an increasing in 10% in mean value of CT Skeletal muscle index (i.e. an absolute mean difference of 4.5) and with an increasing in 20% in mean value of Hand Grip Strength (i.e. an absolute mean difference of 6.7). With a two-sided test (alpha=5%, power=90%), 38 patients per arm will be required to detect the effect size on CT Skeletal muscle index (assuming a standard deviation of 5.9) and 45 per arm to detect the effect size on Hand Grip Strength (assuming a standard deviation of 9.6). Thus, a total of 90 patients will be required. To account for an anticipated attrition rate of 20%, a total of 114 patients will be included and randomized.

Statistical Analysis Plan Statistical analyses will be independently performed by the Biostatistics Department of University of Lille under the responsibility of Professor Alain Duhamel. Data will be analyzed using the SAS software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) and all statistical tests will be performed with a 2-tailed alpha risk of 0.05. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written and finalized prior to the database lock.

All analyses will be performed for all randomized patients based on their original group of randomization, regardless of the treatment they actually received, study eligibility, or compliance post randomization, according to the intention-to-treat principle. Nis planned Baseline characteristics will be described for each arm. Quantitative variables will be expressed as mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range) and range. Qualitative variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Normality of distribution will be assessed graphically and using the Shapiro-Wilk test.

Co-Primary outcome The change in CT Skeletal muscle index and Hand Grip Strength from baseline to 3 months will be estimated and compared between the 2 arms using the constrained longitudinal data analysis model that was proposed by Liang and Zeger. The constrained longitudinal data analysis model will be used for its potential advantages compared to a conventional longitudinal analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. In the constrained longitudinal data analysis, both the baseline and post baseline values are modeled as dependent variables using a linear mixed model (an unstructured covariance pattern model), and the true baseline means are constrained to be the same for the 2 treatment arms. Hence, the constrained longitudinal data analysis provides an adjustment for observed baseline differences in estimating treatment effects, using all available baseline and post-baseline values. The mean between-group difference (with a 95% confidence interval(CI)) in the 3-month change in CT Skeletal muscle index and Hand Grip Strength (BCAA vs. placebo) will be estimated as an effect size with the time-by-group interaction. If normality of the model residuals is not satisfied, nonparametric analysis will be used; absolute changes between baseline and 3-month visits will be calculated and compared between the 2 arms using a non-parametric analysis of covariance that is adjusted for baseline values. The efficacy of Branched chain amino acids will be declared only if the comparison in both primary outcome is significant at p\<0.05 (two-sided test).

Missing values in CT Skeletal muscle index and Hand Grip Strength measures will be handled with a multiple imputation procedure. Missing data will be imputed under the missing at random assumption (whatever the reason for missing data) by using regression switching approach (a chained equation with m=20 imputations), with the predictive mean matching method for continuous variables, and logistic regression models (binary, ordinal or polynomial) for categorical variables. The imputation procedure will be performed using main baseline characteristics and allocated arm. Treatment effect estimates that are obtained from multiple imputed data sets will be combined using Rubin's rules. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted on the observed data (case-complete analysis) and in per-protocol population. The per-protocol population will include all randomised patients who remain eligible for the study and will be 80% compliant to the allocated treatment. Any patients who will withdraw from the trial or treatment or who will not receive the allocated treatment will be excluded for per-protocol population.

Secondary outcomes The same strategy employed to analyze the co-primary outcome will be used to compare the 3-month change in muscle performance (Measured by change in Chair Stand and Gait Velocity) and the 3-month change in SF 36 - patient-reported outcome.

3-month event-free survival will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method treating death or complications of cirrhosis as a combined events. The treatment effect will be estimated by calculating Hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% CI by using a Cox proportional hazards regression model including centers as random effect (frailty model). The proportional hazards assumption will be assessed by plotting the scaled Schoenfeld residuals of treatment effect against the rank of survival time.

Those subjects randomised to the tight control arm will be reviewed every 4 weeks (by the PI at each site or a designated researcher), and will be treated according to a rapidly escalating regime, involving standard DMARDs and biologics.

From the 12 week visit onwards, escalation of therapy in this arm will be performed if subjects do not meet the objective target of Minimal Disease Activity. Initial escalation will be to combination DMARD therapy. If patients in the tight control arm fail to meet the MDA criteria and fulfil the NICE criteria for the use of TNF blockers in psoriatic arthritis at 24 weeks, then they will be offered treatment with these medications. Therapy will continue to be modified throughout the 48 week follow-up until a state of minimal disease activity is reached. The control group will be seen every 12 weeks in a general rheumatology clinic and will receive standard care, involving standard DMARDs and biologics as appropriate.

It has been well established that development of chronic pain is related to experienced pain in the perioperative period. This study therefore aims to assess if both acute and chronic post-operative mastectomy pain can be better managed by a novel regional anesthesia nerve block known as the pectoralis block (PECs). The PECs block is easier for patients to position for placement, has less risk of harm to nearby structures, and less risk for systemic uptake of local anesthetic in comparison to the paravertebral block. The PECs block has a strong safety profile. Standard of care at University of Wisconsin (UW) hospital is to utilize regional anesthesia for post op pain management. While PVB is performed on a regular basis at UW per surgeon request, Surgeon can request for PECS block in patients where a PVB was contraindicated (ie. coagulation issues). PECS is in fact the standard of care at other hospitals. This study will assess outcomes in the post anesthetic care unit (PACU), post-operative day 1, 7 and 30.","Post-mastectomy pain occurs in up to 55% of patients and can last for months. The development of chronic pain is related to experienced perioperative pain. The development of chronic pain is related to experienced perioperative pain. There is great potential to enhance the quality of life for breast surgery patients if the hospital can improve our perioperative pain prevention techniques. New to the spectrum of multimodal analgesia is the pectoralis block (PECs), which provides anesthesia to the anterior and anterior lateral chest wall as well to the axilla. This study is about aims to compare the pectoralis block to paravertebral block with benefits of ease placement, less risk for harm to nearby structures including pneumothorax, spinal cord trauma, sympathetic block and hypotension.

Literature reveals that the pectoralis block has provided improved pain scores as well as decreases post-operative nausea and vomiting, longer block duration, and subsequent pain relief in patient. Despite these promising preliminary studies, there remains a paucity on the effectiveness of the PECs Block, particularly regarding long term outcomes for patients.

Furthermore, there is no literature to date which has evaluated the best regional anesthetic technique for patients who receive breast tissue expanders, which can cause a significant amount of muscle pain and spasm due to the intended muscle disruption during surgical placement. The primary outcomes of this study is to compare total opioid consumption during the post-surgical period limited to 24 hrs beginning at PACU admission between patients who receive bilateral pectoralis plane versus bilateral paravertebral blocks and subsequently undergo bilateral mastectomy with tissue expanders.

The primary objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of asciminib in pediatric patients with the goal of identifying the pediatric formulation dose (fed) leading to asciminib exposure comparable to 40 mg BID in adult patients (fasted).

The pediatric formulation group will include at least 15 participants in each of the following two age categories: 1 to \<12 years and 12 to \<18 years; leading to at least 30 participants enrolled treated with the pediatric formulation. It will consist of a dose determination part (Part 1) and a cohort expansion (Part 2 BID regimen and Part 3 QD regimen).

In Part 1, 4-6 participants will be enrolled in order to obtain at least 4 participants evaluable for PK (these participants may be from either of the age categories described above). The initial starting dose will be based on body weight and will be administered BID with food.

Once the body weight adjusted dose has been determined in Part 1 of the study, the patients will be enrolled in Part 2 until at least 20 participants, including those who were included in Part 1, have been enrolled (10 per age group) in the pediatric formulation group. Once the interim safety and PK analysis 2 is completed for one of the age groups, the Part 3 QD regimen will open for the respective age group to enroll 10 patients (5 patients by age group).

The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and anti-cancer activity of various doses and repeated cycles of the experimental treatment using the study drug RM-1929 and fixed amounts of red light applied at the tumor site to activate the pharmacodynamics of the drug.

The part 1 of the study has been completed and consisted in a single cycle, 3+3 dose escalation safety study of the experimental drug RM-1929 using a fixed amount of 690 nm red light. The part 1 was designed to determine the safety of the treatment as set by the maximal feasible dose or the maximal tolerable dose of RM-1929. From the part 1 results, the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929 was determined.

The part 2 of the study is currently ongoing and it is evaluating the safety and anticancer efficacy of up to four repeated treatments of Photoimmunotherapy with RM-1929 at the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929 activated with a fixed amount of red light.","Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is a new cancer targeted technology invented at the National Cancer Institute, USA. This clinical study evaluates the treatment of the experimental drug RM-1929 with Photoimmunotherapy (PIT).

The experimental drug, RM-1929, is a parental formulation consisting of a chemical conjugate of the dye IR700 with the FDA approved antibody, Erbitux® (Cetuximab), that targets EGFR receptors (EGFR is a cancer expressed protein, a cancer antigen). EGFR is highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC). It is expected that systemic administration of RM-1929 will lead to tumor accumulation and binding to EGFR expressed at cancer cells. It is expected that treatment with RM-1929 and Photoimmunotherapy can lead to the selective destruction of the HNSCC cancer cells and provide an effective therapy to manage the disease.

The treatment using RM-1929 with Photoimmunotherapy requires two steps:

(i) the administration by infusion of the drug RM-1929 targeting the cancer protein EGFR

AND

(ii) the illumination of the tumor with red light (690 nm) using sufficient energy to activate the drug and induce cancer cell killing.

Light illumination is applied at 24 h post drug infusion to enable sufficient time for the drug to distribute in the tumor after administration. Cell killing occurs only at cancer cells expressing the protein EGFR that is bound to the drug RM-1929. The requirement of binding of the drug to EGFR of cancer cells enables the selective destruction of cancer cells with minimum damage of healthy tissue surrounding the tumor cells. Preclinical pharmacology demonstrated that light-induced activation of RM-1929 elicits rapid tumor destruction of human cancer xenografts implanted in mice and that the treatment is cancer specific.

The Part 1 study has been completed and consisted of a single cycle 3+3 dose escalation study of RM-1929 to determine the safety of the treatment and the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929. From the part 1 of this study, the maximal feasible dose for treatment with RM-1929 was selected.

However, wine production traditionally involves fining, during which some ingredients such as tannins are removed by co-precipitation with proteins derived from milk (casein, potassium caseinate), egg (ovalbumin, lysozyme), fish (isinglass) or shrimp (chitosan). These proteins are derived from animal sources which are known to play a role in food allergy. This is an increasingly prevalent health problem in Western countries \[4,5\] and it may manifest itself as life-threatening anaphylactic shock in the presence of only traces of the allergen. Recently, the safety for wine-fining agents derived from milk, fish and egg was established \[6\]. However, for chitosan, no studies of its safety as a fining agent in allergic patients were performed until now. Chitosan is used as fining agent by the mead and wine industry because of its electrostatic positive charge. Chitosan is obtained by the deacetylation of Chitin \[C8H13NO5N\]n , a derivative of glucose, and one of the most common polymers found in nature. It is the main component of the cell walls of some fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans and insects, the radulae of mollusks, and the beaks of cephalopods, including squid and octopuses \[7\].

Seafood plays an important role in human nutrition and health, and Portugal is the European country with the second highest consumption \[4\]. The prevalence of crustacean allergy seems to vary largely between geographical locations, but it seems common in Portugal \[8\]. The major shellfish allergen is tropomyosin although other allergens may play an important part in allergenicity. The possibility of allergic reactions attributed to traces of chitosan used as a fining agent in wine has not been ruled out, particularly in shrimp allergic patients to whom small traces of the potential allergen may be enough to trigger anaphylactic reactions. Our aim is, therefore, to establish the safety of wine containing chitosan in patients who are severely allergic to shrimp \[9\].

Potential Risks Several studies published in the literature have evaluated the safety of skin tests, but mostly using commercial extracts. Prick-tests to native foods, called prick-to-prick tests, have been less extensively studied. The CICBAA1 data, from 1,138 food allergic patients of all ages, cover 34,905 prick-to-prick tests to foods. The risk of systemic reactions was evaluated at 0.008% \[10, 11\]. The negative predictive accuracy for skin prick testing to foods is uniformly high. A negative skin test confirms the absence of an IgE-mediated reaction with 90 to 95% accuracy \[12,13\]. Therefore, skin testing is highly useful for excluding IgE-mediated food allergy.

However, when positive, these tests, which evaluate sensitization and not clinical allergy, are not without pitfalls, and their results must be confirmed by an oral challenge to avoid over- and under diagnosis.

The double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral food challenge (DBPCFC) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing food allergy and it is preferred for research purposes \[14\]. The overall level of risk associated with food challenges has been examined. A retrospective series reviewed 584 OFCs performed in children who were estimated to have a ≤50% risk of reaction. Forty-three percent of the challenges were positive. Thirty-nine percent of the reactions were mild, 33% moderate, and 28% severe. The type and incidence of the different reactions were cutaneous (78%), gastrointestinal (43%), oral (26%), lower respiratory (26%), and upper respiratory (25%). No patients had cardiovascular symptoms \[15\].

Participants with positive and negative skin tests will proceed to oral challenge, as sensitization does not have a linear correlation with clinical allergy. Although the risk of a positive reaction to oral challenge with finned wine with chitosan is very low (severe seafood allergy is usually mediated by major shellfish allergen tropomyosin, not present in chitosan), for safety purposes the challenges will be performed in an appropriate setting, with CPR support available, medication and a doctor present at all times.

Potential Benefits It will allow for patients with shellfish allergy to be informed if they can safely ingest this wine. Furthermore, it will be needed as a public health measure as this information could be included in the wine labels.

The investigators are continuing to learn how to optimize outcomes from rTMS treatment. The purpose of this research project is to use brain network connectivity patterns as measured by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to confirm a way to optimize the use of rTMS to treat depression. In addition, the study aims to gain a better understanding of how rTMS influences brain networks.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, and approximately 30% of MDD patients are resistant to antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an FDA-cleared intervention with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant depression, but only 30-40% of these patients achieve remission after a single course. Other studies have shown that rTMS targeting the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) is comparably effective, but biomarkers for informing target site selection do not exist. Diagnostic heterogeneity has been an obstacle to biomarker discovery efforts. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to diagnose four novel MDD subtypes or ""biotypes' defined by resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns and predicting differing antidepressant responses at the individual level to rTMS. This pivotal trial will test a novel, biotype-guided treatment selection strategy motivated by the hypothesis that an individual patient's likelihood of responding to left DLFPC vs.DMPFC rTMS is determined in part by individual differences in 1) the degree to which their symptoms are driven by dysfunction in specific cerebral network targets comprising Valence Systems; and 2) the degree to which dysfunction in those targets can be modulated by stimulating the left DLPFC or DMPFC.

In advanced-stage knee osteoarthritis, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is performed to reduce pain and loss of function. However, in the postoperative period, patients may encounter various problems such as pain, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and difficulties in daily living activities.

This study investigates how continuous care counseling based on Roy's Adaptation Model affects the comfort and quality of life of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Roy's Adaptation Model is a widely used approach in nursing that supports individuals in adapting to changes they experience. Counseling and education provided in line with this model aim to help patients cope with the physical and psychological problems they face before and after surgery.

In the study, specially designed training and counseling services were offered to patients who underwent surgery, and the effects of these services on pain, anxiety, sleep quality, and daily living activities were evaluated. The results of the research indicate that continuous care counseling based on Roy's Adaptation Model may be effective in improving patients' postoperative comfort and quality of life. These findings may contribute to the improvement of postoperative care for both patients and healthcare professionals.","Osteoarthritis is a chronic joint disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is particularly prevalent among the elderly population. Knee osteoarthritis leads to significant problems such as severe pain, restricted mobility, and loss of independence, thereby negatively impacting quality of life. In advanced stages of knee osteoarthritis, total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a commonly preferred surgical method to reduce pain and loss of function. However, in the postoperative period following TKA, patients may experience multidimensional problems such as pain, sleep disturbances, psychological stress, anxiety, and difficulties in daily living activities.

In modern nursing practice, the management of these problems experienced by patients before and after surgery and the improvement of their quality of life are of great importance. Roy's Adaptation Model is a theoretical framework frequently utilized in nursing that supports individuals in adapting to environmental changes and stressors. This model advocates for a holistic assessment of patients in terms of their physiological, psychological, social, and role functions, and for the structuring of care plans accordingly.

OTHER,NCT06854679,Dose Escalated Radiotherapy for Rectal Cancers Using MR-guided Radiotherapy,A Feasibility Study in Dose Escalated Treatment in Rectal Cancer on Mr-Linac Using Mr GuidED Adaptive Radiotherapy,"Standard radiotherapy in the UK involves having daily chemotherapy tablets with radiotherapy treatment for 5 weeks at a dose of 52.5Gy to the rectal cancer over 25 fractions. This is the likely treatment participants will be having if they decide not to take part in this study. Increasing the dose to 60Gy is shown to increase the chance that rectal cancer will be treated completely, a term known as ""complete pathological response"". Patients who have a complete pathological response after their treatment can avoid surgery and enter into a surveillance programme to monitor for early signs of the cancer returning. Surveillance can mean 3-6 months camera tests and MRI scans depending on the local unit. If these patients continue to show signs of complete pathological response then they can avoid long term complications from surgery such as a stoma. Unit studies have shown that that increasing the dose of radiotherapy can cause slightly more bowel and bladder side effects, but using adaptive radiotherapy to limit radiotherapy to normal tissue could keep the rate of bothersome side effects as low, which is similar as standard treatment.

All adaptive treatments within this trial will be delivered on a state of the art, radiotherapy machine called an MR-linac (Magnetic Resonance Linear Accelerator). It combines an MRI scanner with a radiotherapy treatment machine called a Linear Accelerator (called a 'linac' for short). The use of the MR-linac means there is no extra radiation dose given when taking daily images to check for the position of participants rectal cancer (unlike CT scans or X-ray). It also enables the investigators to adapt or 'tweak' the radiotherapy plan each day to match the exact position of the rectal cancer and adjacent organs. The non-adaptive fractions can be delivered on either the MR-Linac or CT-linac depending on factors such as treatment machine availability.

The investigators will deliver the treatment on the MR-linac using a technique called intensity modulated radiotherapy (precise X-ray treatment, called IMRT for short). IMRT is able to mould radiotherapy treatment according to what the investigators can see, therefore enabling the investigators to give highly targeted treatment. The investigators already have considerable experience in delivering radiotherapy to rectal cancer with this machine and now wish to focus on whether they could increase dose to benefit long term outcome for all rectal cancer patients as well as reducing the side effects of treatment.

The purpose of this research is to increase the dose to rectal cancer while adapting to the changes that the investigators can see to the rectal cancer during treatment. This means that if the rectal cancer is seen to reduce in size they will be able to deliver a 'shrinking boost' according to what can be seen. This will enable the investigators to give high dose radiotherapy to the cancer whilst limiting radiotherapy to healthy tissue. Without the ability to adapt to changes that the investigators see to the tumour throughout the entire treatment course, standard treatment delivers dose to a larger area of surrounding healthy tissue to ensure that the tumour is sufficiently targeted.

The investigators want to find out if by using this adaptive, shrinking boost approach, they can safely increase radiotherapy dose to rectal cancer, whilst limiting the side effects you experience, in comparison with standard treatment. If this is possible, then this would lead into further clinical trial where the investigators would compare outcomes of higher-dose treatment to standard-of-care. The investigators can't be certain that the side effects will be different, and they don't know if this treatment results in the best chance of cancer cure. However they know from other studies that this is the likely outcome, with surgery being delayed for patients. Patients who have a complete pathological response after combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment enter into a surveillance programme where MRI and camera tests (flexible sigmoidoscopy) are performed at regular intervals looking for early signs of cancer returning.

The investigators expect that the chance of participants having a complete pathological response with this technique is higher than with standard dose, although the investigators can't know this for sure until they have completed further studies. It is possible that the cure rate may be lower or higher than the standard dose.",,RECRUITING,,2025-02-14,2029-01-13,2027-01-13,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,13,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Radiotherapy dose escalation"", ""type"": ""RADIATION"", ""description"": ""All patients will receive 45Gy in 25# to mesorectum and elective nodal volumes, and 52.5Gy in 25# as standard to primary gross tumour volume which includes primary tumour, visible nodal disease and extramural vascular invasion if present.

In this program, fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) are provided with influenza vaccinations (FLU) to eligible patients between the ages of 50 and 75 during FLU season. The investigators hypothesis is that the FLU-FOBT Program can be adapted for primary care settings and lead to higher rates of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS).","AIM 1 (Year 1): To adapt and pilot test the FLU-FOBT Program as a nurse-run intervention during primary care visits at San Francisco's Chinatown Public Health Center. The FLU-FOBT Program will be designed in such a way as to trigger the offering of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) to eligible patients whenever an influenza vaccination (FLU) is provided. Specific components of the FLU-FOBT Program will be developed through a process of active collaboration with health center staff. The FLU-FOBT Program will be implemented in the fall of 2008-9 and evaluated with a combination of process measures in Year 1 of the study. This formative work will be used to finalize the FLU-FOBT Program for further study of its efficacy and robustness in other affiliated San Francisco public health centers.

AIM 2 (Year 2 and 3): To test the efficacy of the FLU-FOBT Program in improving colorectal cancer screening rates in a time-randomized, controlled trial involving other public health centers in the San Francisco Community Health Network that serve ethnically diverse, economically disadvantaged patients. During the 2009-10 influenza vaccination season, the FLU-FOBT Program will be tested in a randomized trial within 6 public health centers in San Francisco. On half of randomly selected dates at each of these clinics, a nurse will follow a protocol that directs them to offer FOBT to eligible patients whenever they are offered an influenza vaccine (intervention), and on the other dates nurses will be directed to offer just influenza vaccine alone (control). The primary efficacy outcome will be the proportion of intervention subjects between the ages of 50 and 80 and are initially due for CRCS who become up to date 3 months after the intervention is completed, as compared with similar subjects in the control group.

AIM 3 (Years 2 and 3): To evaluate the robustness of the FLU-FOBT Program as implemented within these 6 clinics. In the 2009-10 influenza vaccination season, we will also test the robustness of the FLU-FOBT Program as implemented at the 6 sites that participate in the time-randomized trial. Robustness will be measured according to the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) described by Glasgow and others \[2\]. Reach will be measured as the proportion of the target population that is offered screening, and Effectiveness will be measured as the proportion of the target population that gets screened with the intervention. Adoption will be measured as the proportion of invited influenza vaccination clinic sites and clinic staff members that participate; Implementation will be assessed according to the fidelity with which participating sites and clinic staff follow the key elements of FLU-FOBT Program protocol and how they adapt the protocol to accommodate local needs and constraints. Maintenance will be assessed by determining the number of intervention sites that continue the FLU-FOBT Program in the year after the intervention has been completed, and the overall success of the program where it is continued.

Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining monoclonal antibody therapy with interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (MDX-CTLA4) in combination with high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients with metastatic melanoma. (Phase I is closed to accrual as of 4/13/2004).
* Determine the activity of MDX-CTLA4 administered at the MTD with high-dose IL-2 in these patients.
* Determine whether the administration of IL-2 alters the pharmacokinetics of MDX-CTLA4 in these patients.
* Determine the safety and adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (MDX-CTLA4).

* Phase I: Patients receive MDX-CTLA4 IV on days 0, 21, and 42. Patients also receive high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 15 doses beginning on days 22 and 43. Treatment repeats every 63 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with an ongoing partial response and no greater than grade 1 toxicity may receive additional courses of therapy. Patients who require discontinuation of MDX-CTLA4 due to toxicity may continue receiving IL-2 at the discretion of the investigator.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MDX-CTLA4 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I is closed to accrual as of 4/13/2004).

* Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD of MDX-CTLA4. Patients who achieve a partial or complete response and later develop recurrent or progressive disease may be retreated at the same dose.

Patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

The imaging agent involved in this study is 16α-\[18F\]-fluoro-17β-estradiol (18F-FES).,"This study is an open, multi-center and prospective clinical study, It is the first time investigators are examining this imaging agent in Chinese patients with breast cancer.

The Chinese FDA has approved 18F-FES as an investigational tracer in a selective few research studies. The Chinese FDA has not approved this tracer for any use outside of research. In this research study, the investigators are investigating the use of a PET tracer called 18F-FES in patients with breast cancer.

The purpose is to take images that can measure the amount of a protein called Estrogen Receptor, or 'ER' in breast tumors. The expression level of ER is tightly correlated with the Fulvestrant efficacy in patients with breast cancer. The investigators will take the pictures of the participant's residual tumor lesions using a PET/CT scanner with 18F-FES used as the tracer before and after the first cycle of Fulvestrant treatment. The investigators are trying to clarify the relationship between the clinical Fulvestrant efficacy and the amount change of 18F-FES uptake by breast tumor around the first cycle of Fulvestrant treatment.

This could help them to predict the efficacy of endocrine therapy by monitoring the dynamic levels of ER in advance, and potentially help guide treatment of breast tumors in the future.

18F-FES was initially developed to image the primary breast tumor. In previous studies of 18F-FES conducted in humans, there were no adverse events (there have been no problems). While this is not the first time 18F-FES has been used in humans, it is the first study in which the investigators study its predictive value in the treatment efficacy in breast cancer.",UNKNOWN,,2017-03-05,2019-03,2018-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,OTHER,68,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""18F-FES-PET"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""18F-FES-PET/CT imaging before and after cycle 1 treatment with the first line Fulvestrant"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE,18f-fes-pet,0

Although the negative effects of ADT on muscle mass are well documented, the cellular effects of ADT on muscle tissue are still largely unknown, and studies investigating the mechanisms are highly warranted. Furthermore, understanding the cellular mechanisms through which ADT negatively influences muscle mass and glucose metabolism is important so that appropriate measures can be taken to counteract muscle wasting and comorbidities during ADT. Thus, PCa patients on ADT (Zoladex), along with non-ADT treated PCa patients serving as controls, will be invited to participate in this study, that aims to investigate the influence of ADT on the basal muscle protein turnover, as well as the responses to strength training. Secondary aims are to investigate between-group differences in blood glucose and insulin responses following a meal).","Prostate cancer (PCa) patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (e.g., Zoladex), which leads to castrate levels of testosterone, experience troublesome side effects during and after treatment. Commonly reported side effects are loss of lean body mass (LBM) and increased fat mass, as well as impaired glucose- and fat metabolism. Strength training has shown positive effects on LBM in PCa patients on ADT, however, counteracting a substantial LBM loss observed in the control groups seem to account for the intervention effect seen in several of the individual studies. Thus, the real LBM gain following strength training in PCa patients on ADT may be hampered compared to healthy elderly men, but data on this is limited in the literature.

The planned acute recovery study is a continuation of the physical exercise and prostate cancer (PEPC) trial, which was a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of strength training on body composition, muscle strength, and muscle cellular outcomes during ADT.

Beyond locomotion and activity of daily living, the skeletal muscle tissue plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and impaired glucose uptake to the muscle is associated with diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. In fact, increased levels of fasted blood glucose and insulin have been reported during the first year of ADT. Interestingly, insulin resistance has been noted as early as three months into the treatment. Insulin resistance may, in addition to the increased risk for metabolic comorbidities, also impair the anabolic response in muscles to feeding and exercise. Consequently, the accelerated muscle mass loss, and the potential limited response to strength training might be interlinked to the reduction in insulin sensitivity in PCa patients receiving ADT.

Although the negative effects of ADT on muscle mass are well documented, the cellular effects of ADT on muscle tissue are still largely unknown, and studies investigating the mechanisms are highly warranted. Furthermore, understanding the cellular mechanisms through which ADT negatively influences muscle mass and glucose metabolism is important so that appropriate measures can be taken to counteract muscle wasting and comorbidities during ADT.

The aim of the project is to ensure hematology care teams that are participating in new value-based reimbursement models have an accurate understanding of the evidence and roles of new therapies for CLL and best practice supportive care protocols to proactively assess, monitor, and manage symptoms to promote successful clinical outcomes. Hematology teams at seven health systems across the U.S. will be given online clinical training on the latest evidence for treatment planning in CLL along with best supportive care practices for patients on novel CLL treatments, prior to using Carevive's patient engagement software. Once training is complete, the Carevive software will be employed in the clinic whereby CLL patients will use the Carevive patient portal to report any symptoms at and in between clinic visits. Patients will be given a user name and password to a web-based portal for 24/7 reporting of symptoms experienced. Patient-reported and clinical data will be processed by the Carevive rules engine technology to generate evidence-based supportive care plans providing patients with direction regarding self-management strategies, care coordination for relevant cancer center services, and direction on when to go to the emergency department (ED) or call their hematologist based on their institution's protocol. For patients who require ongoing and routine monitoring, such supportive care recommendations will be included in supportive care plans generated at the clinic visit. On the visits subsequent to the delivery of the care plan, patients will report on the perceived effectiveness of the intervention (or barriers to non-adherence to the intervention). Patients and clinicians will assess symptom severity at each visit for a 16-week period and both data sets will be stored and analyzed for research purposes.","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of adult leukemia in Western countries with 18,960 new cases and 4660 deaths expected in 2016. Rapid therapeutic advances in the past five years have changed the landscape of CLL treatment giving patients many more treatment options. Fit patients with favorable disease features such as mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgHV genes) have long term benefit from chemoimmunotherapy and new oral agents such as ibrutinib and idelalisib and the BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, provide effective options for relapsed patients.

With recent FDA approvals, the treatment armamentarium for relapsed/refractory CLL has been transformed in the past several years. Clinicians are faced with a plethora of new treatment options and associated guideline updates, making clinical decision-making much more complex. It is challenging for the modern-day hematologist to stay current on the comparative evidence of the risks/benefits of various treatment options with so many choices. Such novel regimens are changing the survival outcomes and offering new opportunities for the long-term management of CLL. While risk-benefit profiles are favorable, diligent supportive care practices are required to promote patient engagement and successful clinical outcomes as such agents are powerful, leading to potential toxicities that must be diligently monitored.

Since new agents have had limited use in the clinic, real-world evidence on patient symptom experience is not available to guide practice and there is limited data on the effectiveness of evidence-based supportive care recommendations. This is a challenge for hematology teams, particularly because CLL patients are amongst the highest rates of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations (along with lung and colon cancers). Retrospective data demonstrated that patient demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as chemotherapy choice, were associated with ER visits and hospitalizations in patients with CLL. Specifically, significant increases in ER visits and hospitalizations were associated with age, comorbidities, use of supportive care, number of CLL-related adverse events, chemotherapy duration, use of certain therapies, living in the Northeast region of the United States, and treatment following relapse.

The outcomes of CLL treatment have been found to vary with age, with poorer outcomes in older patients. However, the elderly population is highly heterogeneous - ranging from ""fit"" to ""frail"". A number of recent studies conclude that while chronological age is an important consideration when making treatment decisions for hematologic malignancies, functional status is more predictive of treatment outcomes. A review of 83 CLL treatment articles published from 1949 to 2011 reported fit patients had more treatment options than the frail elderly and most studies included patients younger than 65 years. It has been noted by a number of researchers that elderly and frail patients with LGL are under-represented in clinical trials and there is need for data to support a tailored treatment plan.

This study will explore the symptom assessment and management practices of providers caring for individuals receiving new and active therapy for CLL, and will also employ a two-part intervention (with both patients and providers) to evaluate the impact of a novel existing technology, the Carevive Care Planning System (CPS), on supportive care and symptom management. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate adherence to evidence-based practices for symptom assessment and management (i.e., ""symptom care behaviors"") of physicians and nurses (providers) caring for individuals receiving active treatment for CLL.

Recent data showed that prevalence of SA among adolescents in Croatia and surrounding countries (i.e. former Yugoslav republics) is alarming and needs serious intervention. It is hypothesized that participation in physical-exercise-and-sport (PE\&S) will reduce the tendency of young people to abuse substances. However, the literature to date has not consistently validated the perception PE\&S factors are factors which could buffer SA among children and adolescents. One of the probable reasons for evident inconsistencies on findings about relationship between PE\&S and SA is a cross-sectional nature of studies done so far.

The morbidity and mortality of breast cancer are much higher than those observed with other female cancers (1). The incidence of breast cancer increases with age (2, 3). Approximately 1.7 million new cases are estimated to occur worldwide, and mortality is increasing in developing countries, primarily because the disease is not diagnosed until it is in an advanced stage(4) Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is considered the standard of care for the management of locally advanced breast cancer and although this treatment has historically been reserved for those with inoperable breast cancer now is increasingly being used for women with earlier stage disease. (5). Encouraging results obtained with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in have resulted in clinicians using preoperative chemotherapy for patients with smaller tumors(6) . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) could reduce surgical morbidity of the breast and axilla. By down staging of the tumor, NACT can convert patients who are candidates for mastectomy to breast-conserving surgery (BCS) candidates \[7\]. Furthermore, it has potential to reduce excision volumes in patients with large tumors who are already candidates for BCS. Another surgical advantage is down staging of the axilla so that axillary lymph node dissection can be avoided (8).

Complete pathological response after neoadjuvant systemic treatment is high, while complete clinical response rates are even higher. Because it is difficult to localize the original tumor bed after a complete clinical and radiological response, marking the tumor before the start of neoadjuvant systemic treatment is required to enable breast-conserving surgery afterward. Achieving adequate margins of excision is an important component of breast surgery. Local recurrence rates are significantly higher for patients who have positive margins of excision (9) some prospective and retrospective data suggested that patients with BCT after neoadjuvant therapy may have an increased risk for the development of a local recurrence .

If this were true, there would be no further advantage of neoadjuvant therapy and this treatment option could be questioned altogether.

On each experimental day, a bolus of 200 MBq FDG + 25 μCi \[3H\] glucose (diluted with saline up to 10 ml) is given intravenously at the start of a 60-min PET scan of the liver. Blood samples from a peripheral artery and a liver vein are collected for determination of blood concentrations of FDG and \[3H\]glucose at appropriate intervals.

In the experiment with glucose-clamp, an intravenous infusion of insulin (0.6 mU/kg/min) is given and blood glucose is measured every 10 min and kept constant at around 5 mM by infusing 20% glucose (infusion rate adjusted according to blood glucose).

During each study, the hepatic blood flow rate is measured by giving an intravenous infusion of indocyanine green (ICG) and collecting arterial and liver vein blood samples (Fick's principle).

Blood samples are analyzed for concentrations of FDG (gammacounter), \[3H\]glucose (liquid-scintillation counter), glucose (enzymatic assay) and ICG (spectrophotometric).

When the experiment is finished, all infusions are terminated and the liver vein catheter is removed and hemostasis ensured by manual compression (10 minutes) and bed rest for 30 minutes before the subject is allowed to stand. The artflon is then removed and hemostasis ensured by manual compression (10 minutes). Finally, the venflons are removed.",COMPLETED,,2011-05,2012-06,2012-06,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,13,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Liver vein catheter"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""Liver vein catheter is placed in the heptic vein via the femoral vein, using fluoroscpoy as guidance."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",PROCEDURE,liver vein catheter,1

OTHER,NCT04379479,Clinical Effect of Dialyzable Leukocyte Extract in Suspected or Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 (FUTURE-T),Assessment of the Clinical Effect of Dialyzable Leukocyte Extracts in Individuals With Acute Respiratory Infection (Suspected or Confirmed Cases of COVID-19) (FUTURE-T),"Main goal: To generate information on the efficacy and safety of Dialyzable Leukocyte Extract (DLE) as an aid in the treatment of patients with acute respiratory infection (suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19).

Primary goal: To generate information on the efficacy of DLE as an aid in symptomatic treatment, by reducing the signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).

Secondary goals:

1. To evaluate clinical deterioration and respiratory alarm data.
2. To evaluate the duration of the clinical picture.
3. To explore cytokine changes associated with the therapeutic effect induced by DLE.
4. To obtain data on the safety of DLE as an aid in the symptomatic treatment of acute respiratory infection (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).
5. To generate information to validate the contingency scale to assess the severity of acute respiratory disease (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).

Justification The systemic inflammatory response has been recognized as being responsible for COVID-19 complications. Immunomodulation strategies to control it are currently being considered, including the use of systemic steroids to down-regulate the systemic inflammatory response, the use of human immunoglobulin and even chloroquine given its anti-inflammatory and antiviral qualities; however, none of these treatments has been sufficiently studied or has shown any significant change in the clinical course of infected patients.

Due to the importance of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the absence of specific treatment, it is important to implement new treatments that allow modulating the immune response, and one strategy may be the addition of DLE to symptomatic and supportive treatment.

Hypotheses by goals.

1. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the severity of the clinical outcome (signs and symptoms) in individuals with an acute respiratory infection (cases suspected/confirmed by COVID-19).
2. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the clinical deterioration due to the acute respiratory infectious process (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).
3. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment could decrease the duration of the clinical outcome (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).","Dialyzable Leukocyte Extract (DLE) (Transferon oral®) is a dialyzed extract obtained from human leukocytes. Its active ingredient is a complex mixture of low molecular weight peptides obtained from dialysis (12 kDa), and subsequent ultrafiltration (10 kDa) of lysed leukocyte and platelet concentrates. This product is manufactured by Laboratory of Scientific Research (Pharma-FT) at the Nacional School of Biological Sciences (ENCB), National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) using a patented method in Mexico (MX/a/2011/013852), USA (US9328152B2), EU (EPA-126128), Canada (2860260), Peru (000969-2014/DIN) and Colombia (14138326).

DLE is a complex drug, the active principle is multiple peptide units. Thus, DLE cannot be fully characterized, requiring the application of analytical techniques that can describe the overall behavior of all of its components (peptide polydispersity).

Two orthogonal techniques have been used to determine the molecular weight of the peptide components of DLE based on their migration through a polymer matrix. The molecular weight of 10 kDa was determined by polyacrylamide gels electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE), while a molecular weight lower than 15 kDa was determined by molecular exclusion chromatography.

The peptide nature of DLE has been demonstrated using an aminogram method. This method includes the acidic hydrolysis of the peptide components until free amino acids are obtained, which are derivatized and identified based on the retention time of an amino acid standard using reverse phase chromatography (RP-UPLC). Additionally, the peptides of this drug were determined to be highly soluble by RP-UPLC coupled to UV, while mass spectometry, coupled to RP-UPLC, exhibited consistent ionization patterns.

Non-clinical and clinical studies relevant to this research. Experimentally, in a murine model of virus infection, administration of DLE showed a decrease in serum concentrations for TNF and IL-6, accompanied by an increase of IFN. In humans, viral etiology is responsible for 90-95% of cases of respiratory tract infections. The common viruses involved in respiratory diseases are rhinoviruses (∼50%), coronaviruses (∼10%), adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and parainfluenza viruses (which generally add up between 10% to 15%), human metapneumovirus (\<5 %). The first evidence that DLE might have a therapeutic effect in respiratory infections arose from the analysis of a series of cases (36 adults and 63 children) with allergic rhinitis who received DLE in addition to the standard treatment. 11% of adults and 25.4% of children reported a decrease in the frequency of respiratory infections. Similarly, in a series of 70 adults and 54 children with persistent moderate asthma who received treatment with DLE as adjuvant therapy, 44% of adults and 31% of children reported a decrease in the frequency of respiratory infections, in addition to the improvement of allergic symptoms. In a study of 52 individuals, the effectiveness of DLE was evaluated by reducing the severity and frequency of infectious symptoms. That study showed a decrease in the frequency and in the severity of the infectious respiratory symptoms (77.1%) in pediatric patients. In comparison, 82.4% of adults decrease the frequency and/or diminish the severity of infectious respiratory symptoms. In a clinical follow-up of pediatric patients with sepsis to whom DLE was added to the standard treatment decrease in C-reactive protein levels, reduction in the neutrophil count at 72 hours after hospitalization, and an increase in the survival rate of 30% was reported.

SARS-CoV-2 induces significant lung damage due to uncontrolled and dysregulated inflammatory activity, then immunomodulatory drugs have been suggested as treatment. The findings related to DLE, support their immunomodulatory capacity as a potential therapeutic tool in infectious respiratory diseases with a prominent inflammatory component.

Primary goal. To generate information on the efficacy of DLE as an aid in symptomatic treatment, by reducing the signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).

Secondary goals.

1. To evaluate clinical deterioration and respiratory alarm data.
2. To assess the duration of the clinical manifestations.
3. To explore cytokine changes
4. To obtain data on the safety of DLE as an aid in the symptomatic treatment of acute respiratory infection (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).
5. To generate information to validate the contingency scale (CS) to assess the severity of acute respiratory disease (suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19).

Hypothesis. The addition of DLE to the symptomatic treatment will reduce the signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection.

The recruitment method will be achieved electronically.

The acute respiratory infection will be classified according to its clinical symptoms, following the Mexican Clinical Guideline in which COVID-19 disease is divided into non-serious and severe cases. The clinical evaluation of the patient will be assessed by a CS designed for this study, and includes three major items subdivided into minor items (range 0 to 4 in each one):

General symptoms: Fever, Headache Superior airway respiratory symptoms: Sneezing, nasal congestion, runny nose Lower airway respiratory symptoms: Cough, Dyspnea, and Pain or Sense of constriction or oppression in the chest.

Statistics. Four populations will be considered for the analysis: randomized individuals in the study or full analysis set (FAS), safety population (SP), the population of the intention-to-treat (ITT), and population per-protocol (PP).

The FAS population will consist of all individuals who were randomized into the study (they are assigned a random number). The ITT population will consist of all patients who were randomized, who received at least one dose of the study drug, and who had at least one assessment of the primary or secondary endpoints after the baseline assessment. Following the principle of the intention of treatment, patients will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned during randomization. The SP will consist of all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and who have at least one safety assessment after the baseline assessment. The patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. As a clarifying note, the statement that the patient has no adverse events constitutes a safety assessment. The PP will consist of all patients in the ITT population who complete all visits, who have an accurate evaluation of the primary efficacy variable, and who do not contain significant protocol violations.

Statistical methods. Demographic data, clinical history, and key baseline efficacy variables for all randomized patients will be summarized by treatment group in tables (number and percentage) for qualitative variables; and in tables containing the average, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum, by treatment group, for the quantitative variables. A comparison of groups at the baseline visit will be analyzed using Chi-square tests for qualitative variables and two-sample student t-tests for quantitative variables (p-values will be provided for descriptive purposes only). Additionally, the medical history, concomitant medications, comorbidities will be summarized using frequency tables.

Primary outcome. The primary result of efficacy will be the measurement of the score of the CS at the end of treatment or early termination, in the ITT population. The algorithm of the imputation of the last observation carried forward (LOCF) will be applied in the case of patients who withdraw, discontinue therapy, or withdraw from the study. The primary analysis will be performed using the ITT population. This analysis will also be performed in the PP population to assess the robustness of the results. The primary outcome will be analyzed with a covariance model that includes the treatment group, baseline value, and center.

The exploratory hypothesis of the primary objective is to establish whether there could be a difference in the decrease in the score of the CS at the end of treatment, under a superiority hypothesis approach described below:

Ho: µPlacebo - µDLE\>0 Ha: µPlacebo - µDLE\<0

Possible superiority of the DLE addition as an aid to symptomatic treatment relative to symptomatic/placebo treatment will be established if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference µPlacebo-µDLE is less than 0.

Secondary outcomes. The appearance of respiratory alarm data will be identified in the study groups, presenting the results in a frequency chart with the proportion of patients who presented alarm data by group. It will be analyzed using the Chi-Square test. The duration of clinical manifestations corresponds to the number of days with any of the signs and symptoms described in the CS. Descriptive statistics will be performed in each treatment group; the comparison will be made using the student's t-test. Immunological changes are defined as changes in the total leukocyte count, total lymphocytes, ESR, and serum concentration of CRP, procalcitonin, D-dimer, ferritin, CK, myoglobin, IL-6, TNF, interferons, and specific antibodies for the virus. Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group vs. visit, as well as the proportion of patients who show normalization of values during treatment.

Sample size. Due to the lack of information on the efficacy of the study drug in cases of acute respiratory infection with COVID-19, the statistical calculation of the sample size does not apply. However, as a descriptive exercise, given the current contingency by COVID-19 pandemic, an estimation of the sample size is proposed in this study based on the CS that has been specifically designed for this study. Contingency score ranges from 0 to 32, considering that the study population is non-severe patients, the scoring average will correspond to the order of 16 points with a standard deviation of 4. It has also been assumed that the scoring behavior is that of a continuous variable with a normal distribution.

The sample size calculation procedure is by means of the Julious 2004/FARTSSIE22 equation for superiority designs in parallel with two groups (DLE vs. Placebo). According to the following values:

a. Type I error: 0.05 (5%); b. Type II error: 0.2 (20%). Power: 1-b: 0.8 (80%) Proposed standard deviation: 4 Difference to detect between groups: 1 The sample size relationship between groups: 1:1 (balanced) The sample size calculated is 253 per group. An additional 10% (q) will be included to offset withdrawals from the study or treatment; therefore, 562 patients (nt) 281 will be randomized by treatment in order to have the estimated number of patients for the hypothesis test. nt=n/1-q =506/0.9=562

Procedures to explain missing data. Missing data for the variables that are measured on a single occasion cannot be substituted, and that individual cannot be included in the analysis. For data that is measured on more than one time, in case of missing data, the last value measured after the baseline will be taken into account. (LOCF)

Procedures for reporting any deviation from the statistical plan. If there are deviations from the original statistical plan, these will be described and justified in the final report.

Selection of individuals to be included in the analysis. All randomized individuals who have received at least one dose of the investigational product under the maxim of ITT will be included in the analysis.

The experimental group will receive VR therapy using Meta Quest 3 headsets over 6 weeks, compared to a control group receiving conventional balance physiotherapy during the same period. The primary objective is to determine whether VR therapy improves functional balance, assessed using the Early Clinical Assessment of Balance (ECAB). Secondary objectives include evaluating perceived quality of life (PedsQL) and treatment adherence over the 6-week intervention period.","Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood motor disability, and at GMFCS levels III-IV it involves significant limitations in mobility and balance. Conventional physical therapies have achieved progress in this population but often rely on repetitive exercises that may become monotonous, affecting motivation and adherence among children and adolescents. In this context, immersive virtual reality emerges as an innovative rehabilitation tool, offering engaging and playful environments that increase patient motivation. Preliminary evidence suggests that VR provides a safe and stimulating environment that can enhance balance and motor skills in children with CP, although some studies have not found significant differences compared to traditional therapy.

This controlled randomized clinical trial follows international quality standards (CONSORT/SPIRIT guidelines) to ensure methodological rigor and transparency. A total of 40 participants with CP will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the VR intervention or the control group (20 per group). Therapy will be conducted over 6 weeks for both groups, with balance assessments performed by a physiotherapist blinded to the treatment allocation (i.e., unaware whether the participant belongs to the VR or control group). It is anticipated that the immersive VR intervention will significantly improve functional balance (ECAB score) more than conventional therapy. Additionally, improvements in perceived quality of life and high treatment adherence are expected in the VR group.

Despite the immense needs, there is a severe lack of culturally appropriate, evidence-based interventions to support the resilience and well-being of these vulnerable populations.

To fill this gap, the study will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a novel life skills education (LSE) program delivered through two innovative approaches: in-person peer support groups and WhatsApp-based virtual support groups. The LSE curriculum, developed through extensive community engagement, covers topics such as stress management, communication, problem-solving, health, safety, and advocacy, all tailored to the unique challenges of displacement.

In the in-person arm, trained IDP peers and local providers will facilitate weekly group sessions over 12 weeks, providing a safe space for participants to learn, practice, and apply new skills while building social connections and support networks. In the WhatsApp arm, participants will receive weekly messages with educational content, reflection prompts, and exercises, moderated by trained facilitators to foster dialogue and peer support.

By comparing these two delivery methods, the study aims to identify the most feasible, acceptable, and effective strategies for rolling out psychosocial support interventions in humanitarian settings, particularly those with limited resources and access. The study will also assess the interventions' impact on key mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and well-being, as well as life skills, functioning, and implementation metrics such as reach, adoption, and sustainability.

Ultimately, the RESETTLE-IDPs study seeks to generate actionable evidence to inform the development and scale-up of culturally responsive, community-driven interventions that can promote the mental health and resilience of conflict-affected populations in Nigeria and beyond. By empowering IDP youth and women with the knowledge, skills, and support to navigate the challenges of displacement, the study aims to contribute to a brighter, more hopeful future for these resilient communities","The RESETTLE-IDPs study is a cluster-randomized type II effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a life skills education (LSE) intervention delivered through two innovative approaches - in-person peer support groups and WhatsApp-based virtual support groups - to improve the mental health and well-being of internally displaced persons in Nigeria.

Background and Rationale:

Nigeria is facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with over 2.7 million people internally displaced due to armed conflict, communal violence, and natural disasters. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Nigeria, particularly youth and women, are at high risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to exposure to trauma, loss, and ongoing stressors. Despite the immense needs, there is a severe lack of culturally appropriate, evidence-based interventions to support the mental health and resilience of IDP populations in Nigeria and other low-resource humanitarian settings.

Life skills education (LSE) is a promising approach to promoting mental health and well-being among conflict-affected populations. LSE programs aim to equip individuals with the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to navigate challenges, cope with stress, and make healthy decisions. Previous studies have shown that LSE interventions can improve mental health outcomes, social-emotional learning, and positive youth development in various contexts. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness and implementation of LSE programs specifically tailored for IDP youth and women in Nigeria, and how different delivery methods (e.g., in-person vs. mobile-based) may impact their reach, acceptability, and sustainability.

Study Objectives:

The primary objective of the RESETTLE-IDPs study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 12-week LSE intervention, delivered through either in-person peer support groups or WhatsApp-based virtual support groups, on mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, PTSD, and well-being) among IDP youth and women in Nigeria, compared to a wait-list control group.

Secondary objectives include:

1. To assess the impact of the LSE intervention on life skills acquisition, daily functioning, and social support among IDP youth and women.
2. To compare the feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and cost-effectiveness of in-person vs. WhatsApp-based delivery methods for the LSE intervention.
3. To explore the contextual factors, implementation processes, and mechanisms of change that influence the effectiveness and sustainability of the LSE intervention in IDP settings.
4. To engage stakeholders (IDP communities, health workers, humanitarian organizations, policymakers) in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the LSE intervention to promote its cultural relevance, ownership, and scalability.

Methods: The study will use a three-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial design, with IDP camps in Nigeria randomly allocated to one of two groups: (1) in-person LSE peer support groups, (2) WhatsApp-based LSE virtual support groups. The target population includes IDPs youth aged 13 years and above residing in selected camps in Borno State, the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency and displacement crisis in Nigeria.

The intervention will consist of a culturally adapted LSE curriculum covering topics such as stress management, communication skills, problem-solving, health and hygiene, safety and protection, gender norms, and community mobilization. The curriculum will be developed through a participatory process involving IDP youth and women, community leaders, health workers, and education specialists, drawing on existing evidence-based resources and guidelines (e.g. UNICEF LSE Toolkit).

In the in-person arm, trained IDP peers and local providers will facilitate weekly gender- and age-segregated support groups of 10-12 participants over a 12-week period. The groups will provide a safe space for participants to learn and practice life skills, share experiences, and provide mutual support. Sessions will use interactive, experiential learning methods such as role-plays, discussions, and group projects.

In the WhatsApp arm, participants will be enrolled in moderated virtual support groups that deliver the LSE curriculum through weekly conversations, including psychoeducational content, reflection prompts, skill-building exercises, and peer discussion topics. Trained IDP facilitators will moderate the groups to ensure safe and supportive interactions, provide feedback, and encourage skill application.

The study will enroll a total of 500 participants (250 per arm) across 20 IDP camps, with an estimated 25 participants per camp. Participants will be recruited through community-based mobilization strategies, with support from camp leaders, health workers, and NGO partners.

Data will be collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data will include validated mental health scales, as well as locally adapted measures of life skills, functioning, and social support. Qualitative data will include in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with participants, facilitators, and stakeholders to explore experiences, perceptions, and contextual factors influencing the intervention.

Data analysis will use an intent-to-treat approach, with mixed-effects regression models to assess intervention effects on primary and secondary outcomes, accounting for clustering at the camp level. Qualitative data will be analyzed thematically to identify barriers, facilitators, and mechanisms of change. Implementation outcomes (e.g., reach, fidelity, acceptability) will be assessed using process evaluation frameworks (e.g., RE-AIM).

Expected Results and Impact:

The RESETTLE-IDPs study aims to generate rigorous evidence on the effectiveness and implementation of a culturally adapted LSE intervention for improving the mental health and well-being of IDP youth and women in Nigeria. The study findings will have important implications for the design, delivery, and scale-up of psychosocial support interventions in humanitarian settings, particularly those affected by conflict and displacement.

By comparing in-person and WhatsApp-based delivery methods, the study will provide valuable insights into the relative advantages, challenges, and effectiveness of different approaches to reaching and engaging IDP populations. The use of implementation science frameworks and participatory research methods will ensure that the intervention is not only effective but also feasible, acceptable, and sustainable in real-world contexts.

The study will also contribute to capacity-building and empowerment of IDP communities by training and engaging youth and women as peer facilitators, researchers, and advocates. The participatory approach aims to foster local ownership, leadership, and sustainability of the intervention beyond the research period.

Ultimately, the RESETTLE-IDPs study has the potential to inform policy, practice, and funding priorities for mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian settings, both in Nigeria and globally. By advancing the evidence base on culturally relevant, community-based interventions, the study can contribute to reducing the global burden of mental health disorders and promoting the resilience and well-being of conflict-affected populations.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2024-08-01,2026-07,2026-07,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,500,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Life Skills Education"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""The RESETTLE-IDPs study compares two innovative delivery approaches for a culturally-adapted life skills education (LSE) intervention aimed at improving the mental health and well-being of internally displaced persons in Nigeria.

This study is being conducted as part of an MSc qualification at the Institute of Technology, Sligo in Ireland. The study will be conducted in conjunction with Sligo University Hospital and it attained ethical approval through the relevant University Hospital Ethics Committee.","Pilates is an exercise form created by Joseph Pilates in the 1920s. It is a programme of mind-body exercise focusing on strength, core stability, flexibility, muscle control, posture and breathing. Neuropilates is the practice of clinical pilates in patients with a neurological condition. The exercise is ideally led by a clinician with experience and expertise in the area and uses postural, positional and equipment adaptations as necessary to suit the needs of the client. The benefits derived from pilates exercise of balanced strength with improved alignment, postural control and flexibility, could be favourable to post stroke patients who often have one-sided loss of strength and muscle length and subsequent adverse postural adaptations and abnormal movement patterns.

OTHER,NCT06057779,The Effect of Loading Speed and Intensity During Exercise on the Immediate Structural Changes in the Achilles Tendon,The Effect of Loading Speed and Intensity During Exercise on the Immediate Changes in Achilles Tendon Thickness and Stiffness: a Randomised Crossover Trial,"Aim: To assess the influence of loading speed and intensity during eccentric heel drop exercise on the immediate changes in Achilles tendon thickness and stiffness in healthy controls.

Intervention: Three eccentric heel drop exercise protocols, different in loading speed and/or loading intensity will be compared. Each participant will perform a single protocol per session in a random sequence at 1-week intervals.

Participants: a total of 34 healthy athletes will be included.

Outcome measure: tendon thickness and stiffness will be measured at baseline and immediately following intervention with ultrasound imaging (B-mode) and shear wave elastography, respectively.

Discussion: the study will determine whether an eccentric exercise intervention involving a low loading speed and high intensity could maximize the immediate reduction in thickness and associated increase in stiffness of the Achilles tendon compared with interventions involving a higher loading speed and lower intensity.","Mechanical loading of the Achilles tendon during isolated eccentric contractions induces immediate changes in its structural properties. However, it is not known whether the loading speed and intensity has any impact on these changes. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influence of loading speed and intensity during eccentric heel drop exercises on the immediate changes in Achilles tendon thickness and stiffness in healthy controls.

Each participant will perform eccentric heel-drops on their dominant leg with and a fully extended knee, and with additional 20% body weight (added via a weighted backpack). Participants will stand with the forefoot of the tested limb on the edge of a step, with the ankle maximally plantar flexed and with body weight centred on this limb. Eccentric loading occurs when the participant lowers the heel to a predetermined angle and speed (depending on the type of intensity and speed cfr infra). In order to return to baseline, the body mass will therefore be shifted to the non-dominant leg to raise the body. Visual feedback (monitor) will be in front of the subjects and the exercise parameters (velocity and ankle angle) will be guided by software guidelines (Ultium Motion).

Three protocols will be compared that differ in execution speed (namely a fast protocol; 1 Hz: 1 second per repetition versus a slow protocol; 0.33 Hz: 3 seconds per repetition) and loading intensity (namely heavy; exercise into maximal dorsiflexion versus light; exercise into neutral ankle position).

Protocol 1 (=Heavy x Slow): subjects perform eccentric heel drops from a maximal plantarflexion position to a maximal dorsiflexion position at a speed of 0.33 Hz, i.e. 3 seconds per movement cycle.

Protocol 2 (=Heavy x Fast): subjects perform eccentric heel drops from a maximal plantarflexion position to a maximal dorsiflexion position at a speed of 3 Hz, i.e. 1 seconds per movement cycle.

Protocol 3 (=Light x Slow): subjects perform eccentric heel drops from a maximal plantarflexion position to a neutral ankle position at a speed of 0.33 Hz, i.e. 3 seconds per movement cycle.

Participants will perform one exercise protocol per session, in a random order, and the interval between each session is one week. Six sets will be performed per session, with one minute of rest between each set. In order to ensure that the Achilles tendon's time under tension is the same for each protocol (180 seconds), 30 repetitions will performed per set for the fast protocol and 10 repetitions for the slow protocol.

Laryngoscopes are devices-typically composed of a blade attached to a handle with a light source-that allow examination of the upper airway through the mouth, often for the purposes of intubation. Recently some new laryngoscope devices (including the Airtraq® Optical Laryngoscope, the Storz DCI Video laryngoscope®, McGRATH® Video Laryngoscope, and the GlideScope®) have been developed, which may either decrease the stress related to intubation (reduce neck extension, reduce risk of complications or reduce time elapsed during intubation) or improve intubation success (reduce the number of attempts at intubating). Data are being collected in this study to determine which of these commonly-used devices may be better, particularly in comparison to the current hospital standard, the Macintosh laryngoscope. All of the devices to be used in this study are currently cleared or exempt by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).","Historically, optical and video laryngoscopes have been used as alternative airway management devices for the difficult airway, and as rescue devices. Their use by experienced laryngoscopists has not been compared in a prospective, randomized, head-to-head comparison for routine airway management in adult surgical patients. Video and optical laryngoscopes have been developed to improve the laryngeal view for tracheal intubation and to decrease physiological stress associated with the procedure. The objective of this study is to determine whether these devices offer superior intubating conditions for routine surgical management, over the Macintosh laryngoscope, which is the current standard. The devices to be compared in this study are the most commonly used video and optical laryngoscopes on the market and are cleared or exempt by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Eligible subjects include elective adult surgical patients with an ASA status between 1 and 3 requiring general endotracheal anesthesia. Subjects with a BMI ≥ 40, or undergoing surgery in close proximity to the neck will be excluded. Prior to surgery, subjects will receive a pre-anesthesia evaluation with particular attention to the airway using the Mallampati classification system; atlanto-occipital joint extension; thyro-mental distance; temporomandibular joint function; inter-incisor distance; and dental assessment. Subjects will be randomized for intubation with one of the five laryngoscopes in equal proportions. The following data were recorded: total intubation time, maximum neck extension using an angle gauge, glottic view, assessed by the anesthesiologist using the Cook modification of the Cormack-Lehane grading system (Figure 1), and ease of tracheal intubation using a 5-point rating scale; 5 (excellent) to 1 (poor).

OTHER,NCT06589479,Prevention of Refeeding Syndrome,Effects of Different Caloric Density Intake in Prevention of Refeeding Syndrome in Critically Ill Children,To determine effects of different caloric density intake in prevention of refeeding syndrome in critically ill children,"Refeeding syndrome, a critical condition in undernourished patients, is characterized by metabolic and electrolyte imbalances that occur upon reintroducing nutrition after a period of prolonged fasting which can lead to a sharp increase in morbidity and mortality rates following their release and the resumption of a normal diet. The occurrence of refeeding syndrome is well-documented in conditions such as anorexia nervosa. However, its prevalence among critically ill pediatric patients remains unclear. These patients often suffer from undernutrition due to chronic llnesses,various congenital and acquired diseases, malabsorption, or child abuse \[2\] There is an increasing awareness of the unexpectedly high prevalence of undernutrition and refeeding syndrome in this population. Studies indicate that between 13% and 20% of patients admitted to pediatric critical care units are undernourished \[3\] The early initiation of enteral nutrition is often recommended for its overall benefits in critically ill children However, it may inadvertently increase the risk of refeeding syndrome. Extended periods of starvation eventually result in the depletion of stored energy, along with a critical reduction in micronutrients and electrolytes, particularly phosphate, potassium, and magnesium. \[5\] Upon refeeding, there is an immediate transition from a catabolic to an anabolic state, marked by a rapid increase in caloric intake and a subsequent rise in insulin secretion. This increase in insulin enhances glycolysis-the process of breaking down glucose for energy. The resulting spike in insulin levels can lead to hypoglycemia and promote the transfer of electrolytes from the extracellular to the intracellular space. This movement can significantly reduce extracellular concentrations of potassium, phosphate, magnesium, and thiamine, which acts as a coenzyme. Given the pre-existing deficiencies in these electrolytes and micronutrients due to prolonged starvation, their levels can quickly fall as they are consumed during the metabolic response to refeeding. This abrupt change can precipitate severe complications associated with refeeding syndrome, which stem from imbalances and deficiencies in electrolyte and micronutrient levels Conditions that place critically ill children at high risk for refeeding syndrome . Clinical conditions Chronic critical illness (e.g., congenital heart disease) . Advanced neurologic impairment Eating disorders(e.g., anorexia nervosa) . Dysphagia Gastrointestinal dysmotility Malabsorption (e.g., short bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis) . Malignancy Child abuse Significant vomiting and diarrhea Unintentional . weight loss of 5%-10% of body weight in 1-6 months . Prolonged fasting \&gt;7-10 days . Inadequate nutritional intake for 10 day The clinical presentations of refeeding syndrome, which typically manifest in the initial days of nutritional reintroduction, include disturbances in fluid balance, hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and thiamine deficiency. This syndrome can lead to a range of symptoms that affect the neurological, cardiac, hematological, and gastrointestinal systems, primarily due to electrolyte imbalances. To manage refeeding syndrome in at-risk patients, a gradual and cautious reintroduction of nutrition is advised. The cornerstone of reintroducing nutrition is to incrementally increase caloric intake over a period of several days. It is crucial to monitor serum electrolytes, particularly phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium, and provide supplementation as necessary. If patients exhibit signs of intolerance to the calories despite these precautions, it is advisable to temporarily reduce or maintain the caloric intake at its current level. Once the patients condition has stabilized, a careful and gradual increase in caloric intake may be continued. Additionally, thiamine supplementation is important due to its essential role in carbohydrate metabolism.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2024-10-01,2026-03-31,2025-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,50,ESTIMATED,[],,,0

OTHER,NCT06832579,SmartWatch-driven AF Detection in Stroke Patients,Pilot Study for SmartWatch-driven AF Detection in Stroke Patients,"Unrecognized atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of ischemic stroke. Implantable event monitors (ICM) are the gold standard for continuous heart rhythm monitoring but they have been implemented in very few patients after stroke due to high invasiveness and high costs.

In this trial, patients with implanted ICMs (Medtronic Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor) will be randomized to use one of two wearables (1:1 Apple Watch or PulseOn) for continuous monitoring. The aim is to compare the probability of detecting an episode of AF with a wearable versus the gold standard ICM.

Both groups will use the wearable for 12 weeks. If the wearables detect an arrhythmic pulse curve, this is communicated by vibration. By laying the other hand on the device, a 1-channel ECG is performed. ECG data will be transferred regularly to the CoreLab (Universityhospital Leipzig) for analysis.

After 12 weeks, the patients will visit the site and answer questions regarding the usability, compliance and satisfaction with the wearables.","Patients with established continuous ICM monitoring from the prospective, randomized, multicenter study Find-AF 2 (NCT04371055) are recruited for this trial. Find-AF 2 is being carried out at Leipzig University Hospital since 2020 with the help of about 50 study centers throughout Germany.

The AppleWatch Series 10, a device from the current market leader, was chosen because extensive data from clinical trials is already available and data regarding the market leader has particular societal relevance. The AF detection algorithm is based on photoplethysmography (analysis of the pulse current curve) and semicontinuous monitoring. If a rhythm irregularity is detected during hourly measurements, the measurement interval is shortened. If this finding is confirmed in several consecutive measurements, the user is notified. In this pilot study, patients are trained to record a 30-second ECG with the AppleWatch in the event of notification. This is done by placing the other hand on the crown of the watch. The report will then be transmitted. The AppleWatch must be paired with another Apple device (e.g. iPhone) to use the ECG app and must be charged daily (battery life 18 hours). Our patients are provided with an iPhone for study use and are trained in using the AppleWatch.

The AppleWatch is not certified as medical device, but the ECG data collected by the AppleWatch will be used for research purposes only and not for therapeutical or diagnostical purposes.

The second wearable will be the PulseOn device. The battery lasts over two weeks. No additional device is needed for writing an ECG. AF screening is also performed photoplethysmographically. In the case of detection of an arrhythmic pulse curve, this is communicated by vibration. By laying the other hand on the device, a 1-channel ECG is performed for registration. Regular data transfer is done at the patient's home via a gateway device to the PulseOn server. The Core lab will monitor the data transmission.

OTHER,NCT04141579,Functional Improvement of Coronary Artery Narrowing by Cholesterol Reduction With a PCSK9 Antibody,Functional Improvement of Non-infarcT relaTed Coronary Artery Stenosis by Extensive LDL-C Reduction With a PCSK9 Antibody,"In a large number of patients who experienced an acute coronary syndrome, multiple narrowings of the coronary arteries are identified. Mechanical treatment of the infarct related artery is indisputable, yet mechanical treatment of other bystander lesions in non-infarct related arteries is controversial.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol can speed up the formation of these coronary artery narrowings, and can increase the risk of a second event.

The investigators want to investigate if treating patients with the new cholesterol-lowering drug evolocumab in addition to statin therapy ameliorates blood flow and reduces atherosclerotic plaque size compared with placebo. Improved blood flow and a reduction of plaque size could prevent the need for additional stenting or surgery.","In a large number of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) multivessel disease is identified. Mechanical treatment of the infarct related artery (IRA) is indisputable, yet mechanical treatment of other bystander lesions in non-infarct related arteries (non-IRAs) is controversial. Some randomized studies have favored preventive complete revascularization during invasive coronary angiography (ICA) over conservative medical treatment with deferred percutaneous intervention (PCI). Yet patient selection and medical treatment in the conservative medical treatment groups were suboptimal.

Revascularization of lesions in the non-IRA can be guided by fractional flow reserve (FFR). In current practice, a value of 0.80 or lower is often used to mark a functionally significant stenosis at a stabilized moment after initial hyperemic response. However, recent evidence suggests that hyperemic response to adenosine is impaired in patients with ACS, which could underestimate how flow-limiting a non-culprit lesion is as measured by FFR. A large patient-level meta-analysis of multiple FFR trials showed that FFR values below 0.67 most evidently identify those at risk of MI or death. Thus, in patients with values above 0.67, mechanical revascularization has less apparent benefit as compared to patients with values below 0.67. The threshold of 0.67 could be a lower safety margin applied for non-IRA lesions, with percutaneous intervention (PCI) as treatment. For values between 0.67 and 0.85, medical treatment could be optimized using the latest generation LDL-C lowering agents on top of current high-intensity statin therapy (HIST) before directly stenting the lesion.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have shown to induce regression of coronary atherosclerotic plaque volume (PV) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). As high-risk lesions with large plaque burden (PB) and lipid content are frequently present in ACS, a rapid response on PB and PV can be expected when starting PCSK9-inhibitors on top of HIST. In addition to plaque size, plaque morphology is important in determining residual risk. Lipid-rich plaques have recently again shown to increase the risk of major adverse cardiac events. Lipid rich plaque can be identified using Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS). The amount of lipid is represented in the lipid core burden index (LCBI) and is an independent risk factor for future coronary events. A recent study demonstrated the effect on plaque composition in 52 weeks. In this study, an effect in 12 weeks will be evaluated as a potential independent explanation of reduced events in long-term clinical follow-up studies.The change in plaque volume might be closely related to a change in FFR.

Furthermore, it is now well-appreciated that an ACS, a result of atherosclerotic plaque destabilization, initiates a temporary acceleration of atherogenesis in itself. An ACS induces rapid activation of the bone marrow hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells resulting in monocytosis and activation of innate immune cells, which subsequently accelerate atherosclerosis progression throughout the body. Hypercholesterolemia also activates the innate immune system bone marrow progenitors resulting in long-term activation of the innate immune system. In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), PCSK9 treatment reduced monocyte CCR2 expression and ex-vivo migratory capacity. Therefore, in the first weeks after an ACS occurred, there is an optimal time window for preventing atherosclerosis progression by powerful lowering of plasma cholesterol.

This pharmaco-invasive strategy with a combination of HIST and a PCSK9-inhibitor could possibly prevent mechanical revascularization (PCI or CABG) in a large cohort of patients. Evolocumab was the first PCSK9-inhibitor approved for clinical use in 2015 for lowering of LDL-C as an adjunct to diet in patients with FH, primary hypercholesterolemia and in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). Evolocumab has been evaluated in several large scale studies as GLAGOV (N = 968) and FOURIER (N= 27564) on surrogate and clinical endpoints with important benefits and established safety and tolerability.

In this study we want to investigate the effect of maximal LDL-C reduction by evolocumab in addition to HIST compared to placebo on functional impairment of non-IRA lesions, measured by FFR, and the change in NIRS derived lipid core burden index at the 4mm maximal segment (MaxLCBI4mm) from baseline to follow-up in the non-IRA. Secondly, we want to evaluate the change in multiple plaque characteristics, measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Finally, we will investigate the change in microvascular function, change in pro-inflammatory monocyte phenotype and explore correlations between on treatment LDL-C, LCBI, plaque characteristics and FFR.",COMPLETED,,2020-11-10,2023-11-09,2023-11-09,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,150,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Evolocumab 140 MG/ML [Repatha]"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Evolocumab (also known as Repatha, formerly referred to as AMG 145) is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) that specifically binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) preventing its interaction with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR).

the aim of the study is to Detection of leukocyte cell population data in patients with MPNs and Relation between leukocyte cell population and patients' clinical status.","MPNs are characterized by sepsis, thrombosis, myelofibrosis and leukemic transformation as critical complications of the disease. Most recently, the MPNs have been described as ""Inflammatory Diseases"" because the chronic inflammation being identified as a key factor in the development and progression of the disease . It is characterized by persistent activation of immune cells, elevated leukocyte and platelet counts, release of various mediators, DNA and tissue damage . Consequently. when neutrophils are activated by different stimuli, they undergo degranulation and release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and microparticles, leading to thrombosis in MPNs by blocking blood vessels . Monocyte and its distribution are also a simple marker of activation useful for early sepsis detection .

The leukocyte cell population data (CPD) are parameters used to provide quantitative information on the morphological and functional characteristics of leukocytes. CPD assessment involves measuring neutrophil and monocyte forward scatter (Z axis) for cell size and side scatter (X axis) for internal complexity. Additionally, fluorescence intensity (Y axis) for DNA/RNA content and cell population variability (dispersion width) can also be evaluated.

Therefore, assessing of these parameters in the context of sepsis and thrombosis as a complication of MPNs helps to understand how these conditions interact at the cellular level and provides insights into morphological changes and abnormal leukocyte distribution for early detection and management .",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2025-01-01,2026-03-01,2026-01-01,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,80,ESTIMATED,[],,,0

PSP also face many barriers to accessing mental health services (e.g., stigma, location, time). The PSP Wellbeing Course is a transdiagnostic internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) course that has been specifically tailored to PSP. The effectiveness of the therapist-guided course and a self-guided course have both been supported. Consistent with the larger literature on self-guided ICBT, engagement with and outcomes of the self-guided PSP Wellbeing Course could be strengthened. Persuasive design describes using technology to influence human behaviour. The current study is designed to assess the impact of different timing options (i.e., tunneled vs. personalized) and increased social learning (i.e., standard versus enhanced social learning) on user experience, adherence, and outcomes in ICBT.

Methods--- Participants will be recruited via posts on the PSPNET social media platforms (i.e., Twitter and Facebook) and emails distributed by PSP organizations. Members of the PSPNET team will also reach out to contacts within PSP organizations to ask them to tell their colleagues about the proposed research. All interested participants will be directed to the study website (www.pspnet.ca) to complete an online screening questionnaire. As part of this questionnaire, they will be presented with a consent form explaining the screening. After consent is given, clients will be assessed for eligibility using an online screening questionnaire. The online screening questionnaire captures demographic information (e.g., sex, ethnicity, location), information about depression and other mental health issues, and background information (e.g., medical history, mental health history, symptoms).

After completing the questionnaires, participant responses will be reviewed by PSP staff for eligibility. Clients who are eligible will be randomized into one of four conditions. Participants who do not meet criteria, but are over the age of 18, will not be randomized and will instead be enrolled into the ""treatment-as-usual"" version of the course, which consists of a tunneled delivery and standard resources. Ineligible participants' data will not be included in analyses. Individuals under the age of 18 will not be eligible for any services.The two factors in the trial are:

Factor 1: Tunneled course delivery or personalized course delivery

Factor 2: Standard or enhanced social learning resources.

As this is a factorial trial with two factors, each client will be randomized to one of four conditions:

Condition 1: Tunneled Delivery and Standard Resources Condition 2: Tunneled Delivery and Enhanced Social Learning Resources Condition 3: Personalized Delivery and Standard Resources Condition 4: Personalized Delivery and Enhanced Social Learning Resources

Randomization will occur within 2 business-days of completion of the screening questionnaires.

All participants will receive the Self-Guided PSP Wellbeing Course, a transdiagnostic internet intervention. The program is an adaptation of a previous Australian course, the Wellbeing Course. The course involved 5 lessons that are typically completed over an 8 week period, though participants will have access to the course materials for up to 26 weeks. The content is focused on cognitive behavior therapy and relapse prevention. Materials are presented in a didactic (i.e., text-based with visual images) and case-enhanced learning format (i.e., educational stories demonstrate the application of skills). All participants are presented with worksheets at the end of each lesson that contain exercises that facilitate skill acquisition. Participants will be sent automatic emails reminding them to stay engaged with the lessons and to complete questionnaires. Participants will complete questionnaires at screening, 4 weeks, 8 weeks (post-treatment), and 20 weeks (post-treatment).",RECRUITING,,2024-03-12,2025-04-30,2025-04-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,FACTORIAL,NONE,TREATMENT,164,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Tunneled Delivery"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Participants will be offered a pre-determined pathway to completing the 8-week course"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Personalized Delivery"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Participants will be able to complete course modules at their own pace and in the order that most interests them."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Standard Resources"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Participants will receive the resources as typically included in the Self-Guided PSP Wellbeing Course."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Enhanced Social Learning Resources"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Participants will receive additional intervention content."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Transdiagnostic Self-Guided ICBT"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""An ICBT course that is completed without the guidance of a therapist."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BEHAVIORAL;BEHAVIORAL;BEHAVIORAL;BEHAVIORAL;BEHAVIORAL,tunneled delivery;personalized delivery;standard resources;enhanced social learning resources;transdiagnostic self-guided icbt,0

In this follow-up study the investigator proposes to test how interventions tailored to the high risk subgroup affect pain responses in a pre-clinical cohort.

The optimal theorized match for the identified high-risk subgroup is a combination of personalized pharmaceutical and education interventions. This combined personalized intervention versus a placebo pharmaceutical and general education intervention group is the primary comparison of interest.

However, these high-risk infants require the addition of fortifiers to their milk in order to achieve sufficient levels of calories, vitamins, and minerals for adequate growth. We are currently using a liquid human milk fortifier which does not provide sufficient protein intake, requiring addition of a liquid protein supplement. A new product has been released which provides sufficient protein in the liquid HMF, without the acidification seen in previous products.

This is a prospective, randomized noninferiority study comparing the safety and efficacy of the new HMF with additional protein to our current standard of adding additional protein supplementation on top of the HMF.","All infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Cardinal Glennon at gestational age \<32 weeks and birthweight \<1500g, and whose mothers intend to use breast milk (maternal or donor) will be approached for study participation. Infants can be enrolled at any point up until their feedings become fortified, typically around the 8th day of life.

Eligible infants whose parents consent for participation will be randomized to one of the two study regimens. Sealed envelopes containing the subject treatment group will be prepared from randomization schedules that are computer-generated using a pseudorandom permuted blocks algorithm. Multiples will be randomized together to the same treatment group. The randomization will be block stratified by birth weight (500-1000g and 1001-1500g). Infants will have laboratory values to follow for signs of metabolic acidosis and nutritional status.

Total blood volume for these labs is approximately 1.4 mL, and may be obtained by venipuncture or heel stick. These labs are monitored for nutritional sufficiency in very low birth weight infants already, the only change will be the timing that the labs are obtained.

Infants will remain on their designated HMF until one of 3 different time points: 1) Infant does not tolerate HMF and must be taken off, 2) Infant is no longer receiving breastmilk and is transitioned to a premature formula, or 3) Infant is getting ready to go home and HMF is removed from the feedings.

Hospitalization data will be collected on the infants until they are either discharged from the NICU or until they reach 36 weeks corrected gestational age, whichever occurs first. Data collected will include: birthweight, gestational age, gender, antenatal steroids, APGARs, days of parenteral nutrition, day enteral feedings were initiated, daily enteral volume intake, daily caloric and protein intake, day of HMF and/or liquid protein initiation.

OTHER,NCT00380679,Offering Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccine to Patients Being Evaluated in the Emergency Department,Offering Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccine to Patients Being Evaluated in the Emergency Department,"According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), all people aged 50 years or older and persons aged less than 50 years who have medical conditions that put them at increased risk for serious influenza disease should receive an annual influenza vaccination. However, since the mid-1990s, vaccination rates and racial disparities have mostly remained static, and there has been limited progress towards the Healthy People 2010 objectives for influenza vaccination coverage.

The purpose of this study is to determine what proportion of previously unvaccinated persons in target groups for whom influenza and pneumococcal vaccine are recommended will accept and receive influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine in an urban emergency department (ED), and to estimate the potential impact of ED vaccination on population-based vaccination coverage. The intervention will utilize a combination of assessment survey, vaccine information and pre-printed vaccine order sheets.

The target population for influenza vaccinations includes all patients aged 18 years and older for whom influenza vaccine is recommended by the ACIP. This includes all persons aged 50 years and older and persons aged 18 to 49 years who are in one of the following groups: 1) health care workers, 2) pregnant women, 3) residents of long-term care facilities, 4) household contacts and out-of-home caregivers of children aged 0 to 23 months, or 5) persons with underlying chronic medical conditions which increase their risk of influenza-related complications. The target population for pneumococcal vaccination includes all patients aged 65 years or older who have not previously been vaccinated against pneumococcus or have not received the vaccine within 5 years (and were less than 65 years at the time of vaccination).","PROTOCOL - Baton Rouge General Medical Center

Background

According to the Institute of Medicine, non-institutionalized high-risk adults may present the greatest challenge to adult immunizations. There are a number of barriers to implementation of comprehensive strategies for vaccinating adults:

* Routine preventive health visits are infrequent and transient
* Individuals lack knowledge of the vaccines required during adulthood
* Primary care providers may lack time, knowledge, or ability to perform a vaccination assessment, or it may not be part of their standard practice pattern
* Primary care providers lack the infrastructure (especially time and personnel) to assist with adequately assessing and documenting immunization status

Emergency departments represent ideal settings for vaccination efforts because each year millions of adults who have no or limited access to traditional primary care visit hospital EDs for medical and surgical problems that are non-life threatening. Such EDs often already provide other medical screening and preventive care services in the management of their patients. Almost one-quarter of adults aged 65 years and older make one or more visits to an emergency department each year. Patients who use EDs as their usual source of care are more likely to be members of minority groups and uninsured. These characteristics suggest that vaccination programs in EDs could have a significant impact in correcting disparities in vaccination coverage among patients in older age groups.

Combined with the large volume of patient visits each day, these characteristics would seem to make EDs ideal settings to implement vaccination services for people who have little access to primary care. Furthermore, influenza vaccination in EDs could play a substantial role in correcting disparities in vaccination coverage among this cohort of patients. The American College of Emergency Physicians recommends that ED personnel consider participating in influenza vaccine programs for the elderly if other sources of vaccination are not readily available.

A limited number of studies suggest that about half of patients for whom influenza vaccine is indicated (based on age or other high risk conditions) who have not yet received influenza vaccination during the current season would accept vaccination if it was offered to them during an ED visit. However, since these studies were conducted early in the vaccination season and involved the use of convenience samples, the results might not be generalizable to all patients seen in an ED throughout the vaccination season. The proportion of persons who would not have been vaccinated elsewhere but would accept vaccination in EDs has not been demonstrated. Therefore, the true potential of vaccination in EDs to increase vaccination coverage is unknown.

Additional evidence suggests that strong recommendation by a health care professional, particularly the patient's primary physician, can further increase the acceptance of influenza vaccine. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of counseling by providers who are previously unknown to the patient, as is usually the case in an ED setting, to produce a similar change in patient behavior.

Goals and Objectives The overall goal is to determine the feasibility, sustainability, acceptability, and effectiveness of hospital-based vaccination efforts and to increase influenza immunization coverage among persons aged 18 years and older for whom vaccination is recommended who would otherwise not have been vaccinated. Inherent in feasibility and sustainability are the ability to recoup some income from those vaccinated.

Objective

For patients aged 18 years and older who seek medical care in the ED, determine

1. the number of vaccinations administered to eligible persons
2. the proportion of patients, among all persons not previously vaccinated, who accept vaccines in the emergency department.
3. the increase in coverage that can be achieved through a four-month emergency department-based vaccination program

Study design and methods

1. All patients aged 18 years and older will be approached by the PPS after the chief complaint is ascertained. The PPS will begin and administer a questionnaire on all eligible patients for whom vaccine is recommended. If the patient is eligible, the PPS will read the questionnaire to the patient.
2. If the patient is unsure or states that he or she does not want to receive the flu vaccine, the PPS will determine the reason for vaccine refusal.

If the patient meets criteria for influenza vaccination and/or pneumococcal vaccination, the PPS will inform him/her that influenza/pneumococcal vaccine is/are recommended for them and that the vaccination will be offered to eligible patients in the ED at no additional charge beyond that which is reimbursed by their insurance. Patients will be referred to a physician for additional assessment if they have a questionable or possible contraindication. The PPS will provide all eligible patients with the appropriate Vaccine Information Statement(s) and answer any questions. If the patient agrees to be vaccinated, the PPS will place a preprinted order form in the patient's chart, ask the physician to sign the order, and alert the patient's nurse. The patient will be offered vaccination by an ED nurse while they are undergoing evaluation and treatment in the emergency room. The nurse giving the vaccination will document the lot number, expiration date, time and location of the injection(s) on a label that will be placed in the patient's chart.

Documentation of doses received will be faxed to the patient's private care physician, if the information is available for doing so.

How confidentiality will be maintained:

Personal identifiers will not be retained by investigators beyond the time needed to document dose receipt in the patient medical record.

Exclusion criteria:

All patients under 18 years of age will be excluded. Any patient with a medically unstable condition, altered mental status, or language barrier will also be excluded. Patients who present with a contraindication to influenza vaccination (acute febrile illness or a history of allergic reaction to eggs) or pneumococcal vaccine will not be eligible for receipt of those vaccines.

Immunization status:

Previous immunization history will be assessed by patient self-report.

Data analysis:

The primary outcome measure will be the number of indicated influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations received during the course of the study. Data will be collected and analyzed according to demographic information, contraindications, and clinical consent.

Goals and Objectives:

The overall goal is to determine the feasibility, sustainability, acceptability, and effectiveness of hospital-based vaccination efforts and to increase influenza immunization coverage among persons aged 50 years and older who would otherwise not have been vaccinated. Inherent in feasibility and sustainability are the ability to recoup some income from those vaccinated.

Objective

For patients aged 50 years and older who seek medical care in the ED, determine

1. the number of vaccinations administered
2. the proportion of patients, among all persons not previously vaccinated, who accept vaccines in the emergency department.
3. the increase in coverage that can be achieved through a four-month emergency department-based vaccination program
4. information or incentives that might convince initially reluctant patients to accept influenza vaccine

Study design and methods

1. All patients aged 50 years and older will be approached by the scribe after the chief complaint is ascertained. The scribe will begin and administer a questionnaire on all age eligible patients. Having already taken a history, the scribe will be able to easily determine if the patient is eligible for the study (i.e. does not meet any of the exclusion criteria). If the patient is eligible, the scribe will read the questionnaire to the patient.
2. If the patient is unsure or states that he or she does not want to be vaccinated, the scribe will determine the reason.

If the patient meets criteria for vaccination (i.e., has not been previously vaccinated against influenza this season and has no known contraindications to influenza vaccination), the scribe will inform him/her that influenza vaccine is recommended and that the vaccine will be offered to eligible patients in the ED at no additional charge beyond that which is reimbursed by their insurance. Patients will be referred to a physician for additional assessment if they have a questionable or possible contraindication. The scribe will provide all eligible patients with a VIS and answer any questions. If the patient agrees to be vaccinated, the scribe will place a preprinted label in the patient's chart, ask the physician to sign the order, and alert the patient's nurse. The patient will be offered vaccination by an ED nurse while they are undergoing evaluation and treatment in the emergency room. The nurse giving the vaccination will document the lot number, expiration date, time and location of the injection on a label that will be placed in the patient's chart.

EGFR is highly expressed in many types of tumor cells, which could activate EGFR cytosolic kinase activity by binding to its ligand EGF, and regulates gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis through different signal transduction pathways. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), competitive to specifically combined with the EGFR kinase domain, thus inhibits its kinase activity, thereby blocking cancer cell proliferation or metastasis. At present, EGFR-TKI has been widely used in clinical activity, especially in patients with EGFR mutations, which had been proved to achieved a certain effect. But with the passage of time, a drug resistance is inevitable.

At present, studies have found that the cessation of treatment immediately after EGFR-TKI resistance may lead to rapid progress of cancer. Chemotherapy, as one of the most widely accepted modality in cancer treatment, might also be one of the salvage therapies of target treatment. Therefore, in patients with better physical status (PS) scores, chemotherapy is commonly applicable.

In January 2010, a study published in the journal of Clinical Lung Cancer reported the application of chemotherapy as salvage treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with resistant to first-line EGFR-TKI treatment. Of the 114 patients enrolled, 67 received sequential chemotherapy, the other 47 patients received best supportive care. The results showed that, sequential chemotherapy can improve the survival time of the patients, compared with chemotherapy and supportive care groups (11.2 months vs. 3.8 months, P\< 0.01). Furthermore, in those who received sequential chemotherapy, a regimen containing paclitaxel got higher efficiency and disease control rate than those without (48.7% vs. 21.4%, 79.5% vs. 53.5% , P\< 0.05), as well as longer progression-free survival (PFS, 5.1 months vs. 1.8 months, P\< 0.01) and overall survival (OS, 12.7 months vs. 7 months, P\< 0.01).

Another study in Taiwan which enrolled 195 patients treated with at least 1 cycles sequential chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib shown similar results. Generally, gefitinib as a first-line treatment had PFS for 5 months, and the second-line treatment efficiency was 14.4%. Regimens of platinum or paclitaxel had a better treatment efficiency (50.6%). A poor therapeutic effect was reported for gefitinib as second-line therapy (5.6%). In total, the median OS of second-line treatment was 12.2 months. In addition, platinum containing regimens survival better (21.7 months vs. 8.9 months, P\< 0.01); patients with mutant EGFR benefit more in a platinum-based chemotherapy (24.5 months vs. 8.5 months, P\< 0.05).

Bevacizumab (trade name Avastin ®) is a kind of recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) antibody, which can selectively inhibit the combination process of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, Flt-1 and kinase domain receptor (KDR) in endothelial cells. A reduction of tumor angiogenesis, blood supply, oxygen and other nutrients supply could be obtained after the VEGF loss of its biological activity, thus inhibit tumor growth. The drug was approved for the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer in 2004 by America food and Drug Administration (FDA),thus became the first for clinical use of drugs that targeting VEGF. As the first globally approved anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody drugs, bevacizumab has approved for advanced colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and malignant glioma patients, which was used in more than 500000 cases. In the field of advanced NSCLC treatment, clinical results confirm bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy can prolong OS and PFS of patients with NSCLC, and well tolerated.

The thirty-fifth annual meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) conference released a meta analysis results of bevacizumab combined with platinum chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced non squamous NSCLC. It is confirmed that, treatment with bevacizumab based chemotherapy for advanced non squamous NSCLC patients could achieve significant survival benefit, prolong remission time, and expected safety.

Therefore, the investigators design this phase II to testify the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab + chemotherapy for EGFR-TKI resistant non squamous NSCLC.",,UNKNOWN,,2014-05,,2015-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,24,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Bevacizumab"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,bevacizumab,0

In this study, we are improving a storybook reading treatment to help Kindergarten children with SLI learn new words. In this study, we compare three versions of book reading that vary in how often children are tested on, meaning asked to talk about, the words they are learning in the book: low vs. mid vs. high testing. We then examine which version of the treatment leads to better learning of the words during treatment and remembering of the words after treatment. We also seek to understand individual differences in treatment outcomes by examining pre-treatment predictors as well as progress during and after treatment.","Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) are slower to learn new words than their peers, placing them at risk for academic failure. Our long-term goal is to develop an effective word learning treatment for kindergarten children with SLI, thereby improving their academic and vocational outcomes. During the prior funding period, we successfully taught new words to children with SLI via interactive book reading, a treatment involving an adult reading a storybook to a child and deviating from the text to teach new words. We identified the adequate intensity of the treatment and showed that children with SLI learn an appropriate number of words by the end of 8-weeks of treatment, approximating the number of words learned by typically developing children in prior studies. However, this successful support of short-term word learning revealed new challenges that must be overcome in this renewal to continue to understand and improve long-term word learning by children with SLI. Thus, a second preliminary clinical trial involving 60 kindergarten children with SLI is proposed. Aim 1 addresses the challenge that newly learned words were forgotten once treatment was withdrawn. We attempt to buffer forgetting by comparing different amounts of testing during interactive book reading (low vs. mid vs high testing). Incorporating testing into training is a well-established and highly replicated means of reducing forgetting by adults and typically developing children. Aim 1 will determine whether testing can be harnessed to buffer forgetting by children with SLI under real world conditions. Aims 2 and 3 address the challenge that not all children benefitted equally from interactive book reading. In Aim 2, we identify pre-treatment characteristics of children with SLI that are associated with the slope of learning during treatment or the slope of forgetting post-treatment. Moreover, we select a pre-treatment battery that samples a wide array of skills likely to be associated with learning (language processing, working memory, and episodic memory) or forgetting (overall learning during treatment, decay rate). Aim 2 will provide a foundation for predicting which children will benefit from interactive book reading and will identify which skills are major barriers to long-term word learning by children with SLI. In Aim 3, we classify each child's response at the end of treatment (learner vs. non-learner) and at the end of post-treatment monitoring (rememberer vs. forgetter). Then, we examine earlier performance to determine when treatment and post-treatment outcomes can be predicted. This yields empirically based benchmarks for progress that can be used to tailor the treatment to individual children and establishes the stability of learning and forgetting over time. Overall, this research advances a promising treatment to effectively overcome the significant word learning challenges faced by children with SLI and reveals the contribution of learning and forgetting to language normalization by children with SLI. The results will have impact beyond word learning and SLI because all treatments require boosting learning and buffering forgetting.

These mutations target specific amino acids, at positions 140 or 172 of IDH2, and 132 of IDH1. Mutant IDH proteins acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity allowing them to convert α-ketoglutarate (αKG) into D-2 hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), an oncometabolite which massively accumulates in IDH-mutated cells. At high levels, D-2HG behaves as a competitive inhibitor of αKG and affects the activity of Fe(II)/αKG-dependent dioxygenases. This enzymatic family is involved in a broad spectrum of pathways such as demethylation of histone (JHDM histone demethylases) or DNA (methylcytosine hydroxylases of the TET family). As a result, IDH-mutated cells show altered survival, motility, invasiveness and cell differentiation. In AML, IDH1 mutations might be present in 10-15% at diagnosis

Ivosidenib (IVO) a first-in-class, oral, irreversible inhibitor of mutant IDH1 has shown clinical activity as a single agent in studies involving patients with IDH1 mutated relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML and in front line settings. In phase II clinical trials, IVO yielded 30-35% of complete response rates both in frontline and R/R settings, with long lasting responses. Based on these results, the FDA (Food and Drug Agency) gave its approval for newly-diagnosed AML IDH1mut patients who are ≥ 75 years old or who have comorbidities and in R/R.

Therefore, the aim is to assess the three-dimensional morphological mandibular changes produced by the Invisalign® Mandibular Advancement (MA) (Align Technology, San José, CA, USA) in growing subjects affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis with unilateral and bilateral JIA and to compare them with not-JIA control subjects","A wide range of functional appliances have been designed across the years to obtain a supplementary growth of the mandible by its forward posturing to correct mandibular retrusion. In a review published by Cozza et al., the efficiency of functional appliances used in healthy humans in terms of supplementary growth of the mandible per month of treatment, was measured. The Herbst appliance had the highest coefficient of efficiency (0.28 mm per month) followed by the Twin-block device (0.23 mm per month).

Different authors claimed that functional treatment by removable appliances may be effective in treating Class II malocclusion with clinically relevant skeletal effects if performed during the pubertal growth phase. However, the growth pattern in JIA patients is more complicated and difficult compared to the treatment groups in the above-mentioned studies. The pattern is not only characterized by a decrease in mandibular length, but also by a decreased ratio between the posterior and the anterior face height, due to a failure in the vertical growth of the condyles The favorable effect of functional orthopedic appliances in JIA cases is therefore, besides advancing the mandible, an anterior (counter clockwise) rotation with a possible increase of the posterior face height, if possible. The efficacy of the functional orthopedic appliance in the correction of open bite has been demonstrated by Ibitayo et al.

To date, different types of removable orthopedic appliances have been proposed into the scientific literature for management of deformities in skeletally immature patients with JIA, in particular the activator and the distraction splint. Although functional orthopedic treatment is recommended, literature is still lacking studies on this important topic.

Recently a mandibular advancement device (MA) was implemented by Align TechnologyTM (San José, CA, USA) on clear aligners, for the treatment of skeletal Class II in growing patients. Similarly, to the principle applied in Twin Block, MA is composed by two pairs of lateral inclined planes (precision wings), positioned buccally in the posterior area of aligners, which come into contact each time the patient closes his mouth determining a mandibular forward position.

Regarding the above-mentioned novel therapeutic approach, accurate bibliographic research performed on June 2022 showed that, the scientific literature needs further studies evaluating the skeletal effects produced by the Mandibular advancement with clear aligner since there is limited literature on its efficiency, consisting mostly of case studies. Recent longitudinal studies reported very promising results, when used in the pubertal growth phase. The short-term effects of Mandibular Advancement feature are dento-skeletal with additional growth of the mandible and improvement in facial convexity. The MA clear aligner treatment in JIA patients could bring countless benefits. The main ones are the possibility of performing a class II functional therapy with the same ability of a distraction splint or activators in promoting mandibular growth and at the same time controlling the vertical dimension with a programmed intrusion/extrusion of the teeth. Moreover, these therapeutic approaches should be more aesthetic, less bulky, and annoying appliances which can therefore guarantee greater collaboration from the patient. The latter would be reinforced by the fact that during functional therapy there would be a concomitant dental alignment with positive implications in patients whose facial aesthetics are already partially compromised, the face is one of the most salient and relevant social stimuli humans encounter and automatically evokes neural responses, facial deformity must not be underestimated. Moreover, clear aligner therapy is associated with minimal adverse events related to the periodontal structures compared to fixed appliances, this is of relevant interest in JIA subjects who often suffer from moderate or severe periodontitis.",UNKNOWN,,2022-10-01,2025-01-01,2024-01-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,50,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Device: orthodontic - mandibular advancement clear aligner"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Intervention orthodontic - mandibular advancement: mandibular retrognathia correction with a mandibular advancement using a step-wise approach with clear aligner."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE,device: orthodontic - mandibular advancement clear aligner,0

By definition a ""healthy"" volunteer is an individual who, by physical exam and baseline electrocardiogram, has no evidence of cardiovascular disease and, by history, is not under the care of a physician for any active medical conditions.

Each volunteer will receive a single intravenous bolus injection of 4-8 mCi of the investigational radiotracer Cu\[64\]-25%CANF-Comb followed by whole body static PET-CT imaging at 3 of 4 dedicated imaging time points, (1-4 hours, 5-10 hours, and 22-26 hours or 46-50 hours post injection). For safety assessment, a physical examination will be performed at baseline and at the completion of all imaging to assess for interval change. An EKG and vital signs will be obtained baseline, at each imaging time point to assess for interval change. Blood will be drawn at baseline, and at each imaging time point to assess for interval change in serum chemistries and complete blood count. Urine will be collected at baseline and at each imaging time point to assess for interval change in urinalysis results.

The amount of radioactive tracer in the blood and urine will also be assessed on all 8 adult normal volunteer subjects. One-mL blood samples will be obtained at baseline, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours post Cu\[64\]-25%CANF-Comb injection and prior to discharge. Urine will be collected as a single accumulated collection over 24 hours immediately following injection of Cu\[64\]-25%CANF-Comb and prior to discharge.

Tracer biodistribution will be evaluated by measuring tracer uptake in various organs in the torso on the PET-CT scan. The organs used to describe the biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical will be blood, liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, bone, muscle and other organs showing significant uptake. Only organs and tissues containing a visible accumulation of activity will be selected for image quantification. Region of Interests (ROIs) will be drawn to measure average activity concentration in each organ or tissue. Values in three-dimensional region of interest (3D-ROI) traced on the contour of the organs will be used. For the large organs such as the liver, a large elliptical ROI encompassing as much of the organ as possible will be used to obtain an average pixel value. To estimate bone activity, a narrow, irregular ROIs will be drawn to approximate the visible cross section of the ilium or large vertebrae, and the average pixel value will be used. For blood activity, the average pixel intensity in a large 3D-ROI drawn over the left ventricle will be used, thereby avoiding partial volume effects. Muscle activity will be taken as the average value in a large elliptical ROI in the region of the buttocks as seen on MR images. Fat activity will be taken as the average value in a large elliptical ROI in the region of the subcutaneous abdominal fat. All other non-listed organ's activity concentration will be measured in a similar fashion.

Residence times will be calculated by analytical integration of the fitted time taking into account the radioactive decay of Cu\[64\]. Residence times will be expressed in hours and normalized to one unit injected activity. Blood activity will be also assigned to the heart, lungs and bone marrow, organs for which activity will be not measured directly with an ROI. The heart and lungs will be assigned a blood fraction based on their respective blood volumes. Activity measured in bone is assigned half to cancellous bone and half to cortical bone.

The percent injected dose values will be calculated by extrapolating the measured activity concentration in each organ to the whole organ using standard organ and tissue volumes. These standard volumes will be normalized to each patient's weight. Time activity curves will be then constructed from these values for all organs for which ROIs were drawn including liver, spleen, kidneys, bone, muscle blood pool and remainder of body by combining the data from all the patients.

The aim is to introduce a central venous catheter wire guide into the bronchial arm of the right double-lumen tube and insert it into the right upper lobe bronchus orifice under fluoroscopic control. Then, to validate the new technique, we will carry out a fibroscopic control.","Right-sided double lumen tube (Mallinckrodt - Endobronchial tube) is introduced into the glottis via direct laryngoscopy. After the endotracheal lumen tube has passed the vocal cords, the stylet is removed, and the tube is rotated 90° toward the right and advanced slightly until resistance is encountered. Auscultation is then performed to check the proper side the endobronchial tube was inserted to.

Then, the anatomy of the carina and the origins of the right and left upper bronchus are identified with the video-bronchoscopy.

After a mild plication of the distal extremity of an adult central venous catheter wire guide (0.53mm diameter, 45cm length, one straight soft tip on one end and one ""J"" tip on other), the J-shaped extremity of this guide is introduced through the endobronchial lumen under direct video-bronchoscope. The wire guide is then slowly removed in order that proper alignment between the wire extremity and the right upper lobe occurs. The wire is removed again until its J-shaped extremity appears through the right-upper lobe ventilation orifice. In order to align the orifice of the tube with the upper lobe bronchus, a rotational movement of the double-lumen tube may be necessary. When the location of the orifice of the right upper lobe is identified, the guide is moved forward through the orifice into the upper lobe bronchus.

Once satisfactory initial placement is achieved, the bronchial cuff is left inflated, the wire guide of the central venous catheter is kept in place in the upper lobe bronchus, and the patient is turned to the right lateral decubitus position. The proper positioning of the tube is once again checked by another video-bronchoscopy.

To confirm the exact placement of the tube, a fiberoptic bronchoscopy is performed through the endobronchial lumen to find the right upper lobe ventilation orifice and confirm alignment. Then, it is placed distally to the endobronchial lumen to confirm a clear view showing the bronchus intermedius.

This platform leverages eye-tracking technology to assess and potentially enhance cognitive functions, particularly attention and memory.

The diagnostic component of the study investigates the use of eye vergence responses-elicited during a visual attention task-as potential biomarkers for early AD. Specifically, the study will re-validate eye vergence by comparing response patterns among three groups: cognitively healthy older adults, individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and patients with confirmed AD, based on blood biomarkers (ßA40, ßA42, pTau181, and pTau217). The diagnostic task follows an oddball paradigm, where participants must detect target images (grapes) among distractors (other fruits) across 100 one-second trials, lasting approximately three minutes. Eye vergence is recorded using remote infrared eye-tracking, while participants simply fixate on a computer screen.

The therapeutic aspect evaluates the impact of BGaze Therapy, which employs ""serious games"" designed to train attentional control through eye movements. The game dynamically adjusts its difficulty in real time and provides continuous feedback to enhance user engagement and learning efficacy.

Participants will undergo pre-testing-including blood biomarker analysis and standardized cognitive assessments (MMSE and MoCA)-followed by a two-month training phase at care centers using the BGaze Therapy system. Post-intervention testing will mirror the pre-test protocol to assess cognitive and neurological changes.

OTHER,NCT05903079,Impact of the Placebo Effect on the Effects of Trancranial Direct Current Stimulation in Fibromyalgia,Impact of the Placebo Effect on the Effects of Trancranial Direct Current Stimulation in Fibromyalgia:A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome characterized by generalized musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, non-restorative sleep, cognitive alterations, depressive and neurovegetative symptoms. Conventional pharmacological therapies are known to produce responses with little clinical impact in more than 50% of patients. Functional alterations of the motor cortex and its connections with subcortical structures have also been demonstrated in FM. Based on the above, the objective of this research is to identify subgroups of patients with greater potential for response to treatment with a view to advancing diagnosis and treatment. In this study, the therapeutic target will be transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) according to the potential of responsiveness to the placebo effect, with the precise location of the stimulation area by a neuronavigation system, with the objective of counter-regulating the processes dysfunctional factors responsible for triggering and maintaining FM symptoms. Therefore, this clinical trial aims to compare the effectiveness of anodic tDCS applied in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to sham tDCS in FM, according to susceptibility to the placebo effect and serum endorphin levels.","Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disease that affects more than five million people annually in the US. The population prevalence ranges from 2% to 5.4% according to the 2010 American Society of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria. The female: male ratio has changed according to the diagnostic criteria. When applying the 1990 diagnostic criteria (ACR 1990) it is 7:1 and according to the 2010 criteria (ACR 2010) and revised in 2016, this ratio is 2.3:1. Regardless of the variation in prevalence between the sexes, it is a syndrome characterized by generalized musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, non-restorative sleep, cognitive changes, depressive symptoms and other correlates of autonomic dysfunction, such as colon syndrome. irritability and bladder tenesmus. In addition, FM has a level of psychological distress associated with catastrophism and depressive symptoms, which can worsen the prognosis and reinforce disability more markedly than is observed in other chronic pain conditions. FM is the prototype of dysfunction syndromes that course with pain by processes mediated by the central and peripheral nervous system. Patients with FM have been associated with an increased risk of stroke. In fact, it is a syndrome with great social impact, which demands advances in the understanding of diagnostic and therapeutic processes. In this direction, an attempt has been made to identify factors associated with the potential for response to treatment: potential for response to placebo, clinical, psychological, neurophysiological factors, levels of endorphins and neurotrophins associated with clinical response. The quest to understand the effects of these markers aims to personalize therapy and identify factors that can modify the clinical effect of treatments and the organization of neurobiological systems.

Although the results with the use of tDCS have been promising in the treatment of several chronic pain conditions, as demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis conducted by the Pain and Neuromodulation research group at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (Zortea et al., 2019). ) it is necessary to consider that expectations about pain can directly affect nociceptive processing. Such expectations contribute to the placebo effect that has been shown to be mediated by opioids. The study by Eippert et al. (2009) showed that naloxone administration reduces the neural and behavioral effects of placebo, as well as placebo-induced responses in several cortical and subcortical areas that constitute the descending pain modulatory system (e.g., rACC, PAG, RVM, and hypothalamus). ). Furthermore, it abolished the rACC-PAG coupling induced by the placebo intervention. The expectation of placebo-induced analgesia is positively correlated with the availability of MOR. On the contrary, negative suggestion reduces the analgesic effects of synthetic opiates. All these findings support the close association between opioids and expectations that drive placebo-mediated analgesia.

Therefore, this clinical trial aims to compare the effectiveness of anodic tDCS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to sham tDCS in FM, according to susceptibility to the placebo effect and serum endorphin levels, in the following results ( 1) treatment efficacy, which includes daily measurements recorded in a Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) application, which allows assessing pain from a multidimensional perspective (pain intensity and interference with general activities, mood, mobility, work, personal relationships, sleep and enjoyment of life, etc.) (primary outcome), the primary outcome will be the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) score, which assesses pain levels, sleep quality, mood, fatigue, disability, use of analgesics, etc. Secondary outcomes are the impact of pain on quality of life, depressive symptoms. Predictors of the placebo effect will also be evaluated, through the Verbal Numerical Pain Scale (NPS, 0-10) scores in the last week and through the BPI scores, using a multiple hierarchical model. Among potential predictors, there is disability due to pain, psychological profile, drugs in use. In addition to these, the index of inflammatory markers (serum interleukins IL1-, IL-6, IL-10; TNF-alpha and C-reactive protein); serum levels of endorphins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), S-100B protein and the polymorphisms Val66Met of the BDNF gene and Val158Met of the COMT enzyme gene. Will be included 100 women with FM, randomized to receive active (n=50) or sham (n=50) tDCS, aged between 18 and 65 years. Randomization will be stratified according to the placebo effect response potential, determined after a simulated tDCS session. A variation in NPS (0-10) equal to or greater than 30% after a simulated tDCS session will classify them as high responders to the placebo effect. The follow-up time will be four weeks after a single treatment session. In this way, it is intended to produce consistent evidence for the use of this low-cost technique in the treatment of patients of the Unified Health System, which will be directed to patients with chronic pain at the same time, which will provide data to subsidize the feasibility of studying the effect of this complementary therapy in other conditions, such as refractory depression and neurorehabilitation. In addition, to provide data to better understand tDCS response predictors in outcomes that are related to the impact of pain on the quality of life of conditions that generate a lot of suffering and high costs to the health system.",UNKNOWN,,2023-06-05,2025-01-10,2024-06-10,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,100,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""s-Tdcs"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Intervention: tDCS is a therapeutic method that modulates the membrane potential, where anodic stimuli induce cortical excitability and cathodic stimuli reduce it"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE,s-tdcs,0

Metered dose inhaler (MDI) is the most common method of treatment. Studies show that up to 80% of patients demonstrate incorrect use of MDIs, which results in suboptimal medication delivery to the lungs.

Asthma control can be followed by symptoms, rescue medication usage and measures of airflow obstruction. Current options to monitor control include an asthma diary (relies on consistent use by the patient), pharmacy records of medication dispensing (dispensing does not equal usage), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) meters (significant variability in technique leading to inconsistent results).

We will also be comparing potential differences in the amounts of post-procedure pain medications taken by the patients in each wing of the study,"The experiment will take place in the Chaim Sheba TelHashomer Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. Patients will be recruited from the hospital's Pain Management outpatient facility from those appropriate for the procedure involving Radiofrequency Ablation of the Medial Branch of the Facet Nerve. After receiving the hospital's Helsinki approval, the P.I. and/or other designated staff in the department will approach relevant patients (in line with the mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria), describe the procedure, and collect informed consent if the patient is interested in participating. Consent will be obtained from the patient during the patient visit when the option of RF is agreed upon and scheduled for the future.

Subjects will not receive any monetary compensation. It will be stressed to prospective subjects that participation in the research will not have any implications on their treatment in the hospital, or the relationship with their current healthcare providers. The patients will be advised that they may unconditionally revoke their consent at any given time during participation without repercussion on future care. Pt will be advised that they may withdraw from participation at any time. Data collected during the experiment will be kept in a secure location and will be shredded after the project's completion. All information regarding patient treatment both inside and outside of the project will be kept in the utmost of confidentiality, respecting both legal and ethical constraints.

Patients will be double-blindedly assigned to either IV Paracetamol or Placebo group when they arrive for their normally scheduled appointment for Radiofrequency ablation of the Median Branch Facet Nerve. Both randomization and the blinding will be done by the pharmacy of Tel Hashomer. Paracetamol will also be stored and procured from the Tel Hashomer pharmacy. Patients will be advised that neither the medical staff nor they themselves will know which they are receiving. Patients will receive a slow-infusion of either Placebo ( normal saline) or IV Paracetamol 1 g/100 ml solution over a period of 15 minutes prior to the start of the procedure. During this stage the patient will be monitored, initial VAS score recorded, and pre-operative vital signs assessed (e.g.- B/P, HR, SO2.) The same parameters will be recorded during the RF as well.

All saline bags will be numbered, mixed, and hung by one of the nurses working in the preprocedure/admission area of the pain department. The nursing staff will hold the log book containing the numbered IV infusion which each patient receives, to be recorded on the patients record for future reference. The treating physician, circulating nurse, and the patient will not have any knowledge as to whether the patient is receiving Paracetamol or Placebo.

The patient will enter the procedure room to undergo radiofrequency ablation once the infusion of IV Paracetamol/Placebo is completed. The patient will sign consent for the procedure. The patient will be placed in the prone position. The area of skin over which the procedure will be performed will be prepared and draped in standard sterile fashion. 1.5cc of Midazolam will be given for lite anesthesia. Fluoroscopy will be used to identify the specific site of the injections and radiofrequency. Lidocaine 1% will be inject to the site of the procedure to provide local anesthesia. Radiofrequency probe needles will be place to the determined medial branches under fluoroscopic guidance, with confirmation of placement established by electrical parameters. The a dilution of 2cc Lidocaine 1% 1cc and Depomedrol 40mg will be injected prior to ablation of each nerve. Ablation of the nerve will be conducted with thermal heat of 80 degrees Celsius for one minute for each nerve. 3cc solution of Lidocaine 1% + Depomedrol 40mg will be injected around each nerve after the ablation has been performed. A sterile bandage will be placed over the needle entry points, and the patient will be transferred to the recovery area for further monitoring.

Following the procedure the patient will be taken to the recovery room in the pain clinic and will be monitored for 30 minutes. Vitals will be assessed immediately post-op in the recovery room and again after 30 minutes, just prior to discharge. They will be asked when they get to the recovery room and again after 30 minutes, prior to discharge, to assess their level of pain. Requests for additional analgesia (Optalgin, etc) will be assessed. Pt will be asked at 0 minutes and at 30 minutes following entry to recovery room if they are experiencing any of a number of side effects and there responses noted in their records.

Patients will be provided with a packet containing copies of the Oswestry and Roland Disability Questionaires. The patients will complete both questionaires daily (at noon) for the first week and then weekly for the remaining 5 weeks of follow up. The questionnaire evaluate the patients' pain level, level of functioning, and measures of quality of life.

OTHER,NCT03288779,Theta Burst Stimulation for Schizophrenia,Theta Burst Stimulation for Schizophrenia,"Purpose and objective Schizophrenia is a chronic debilitating illness with cognitive deficits that cause serious impairment in psychosocial recovery and with few treatments to remediate these deficits. One area that holds great promise for the development of novel, effective therapies is noninvasive brain stimulation. The investigators have used one form of brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), for some time to modulate and enhance cognitive function in the brain, especially working memory (WM) function, which has a central role in most executive processing that occurs in the brain. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a paradigm of TMS which has been shown to effectively modulate WM. Moreover, TBS can modulate gamma neural oscillations in the brain and neural activity, both of which have been implicated in the physiology of WM and pathophysiology of the disease process in schizophrenia, making these measures highly valuable for assessing physiological effects of TBS on cognition, quality of life and cortical inhibition. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of TBS on WM in patients with schizophrenia, to develop evidence for potential brain stimulation techniques to treat cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

Study activities and population group: Study subjects will be inpatient schizophrenic individuals with minimal positive symptoms and predominant cognitive deficits at Duke University Hospital. In an initial session they will be screened and taught a WM task. Following this, one TBS session will follow in which TBS will target dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. They will perform the WM task before, with and after the TBS, with an expected pre-post enhancement of WM performance.

Implications - There is a great need for treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. The results of this study will serve to generate pilot data for a much larger grant to develop a TBS therapy for remediating such cognitive deficits.","Purpose of the study Aim1: Evaluate the effect of theta burst stimulation (TBS) on working memory (WM) in patients with schizophrenia. Hypothesis 1 - There will be significant improvement in WM compared to baseline with one session of TBS.

Background and Significance Schizophrenia is an illness known to have cognitive deficits, with a chronic and variable course. There is extensive research on cognitive deficits, with working memory, processing speed and verbal memory being some of the domains affected. Some modalities of treatment that have been tried to reverse these cognitive deficits are medications and cognitive behavioral therapy with minimal benefits. A few studies have shown modulation of working memory with routine repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at frequencies not exceeding 10 to 20 Hz of stimulation. Other studies have shown the working memory to be related to gamma oscillations. A few studies have also shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) modulates these gamma oscillations as well. There is an extensive body of literature that shows that working memory has contributions from theta and gamma oscillations in the brain. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), that entrains gamma and theta frequencies in the brain. It could be the most appropriate form of brain stimulation for improving cognition in schizophrenia patients because it has been shown to modulate brain oscillations in small samples of patients. The area for targeting would be the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex which is the site of origin of the gamma oscillations and plays a significant role in working memory.

Design and Procedures The study is designed to be a pilot one evaluating the effect of TBS on WM in patients with schizophrenia. The investigators plan to screen 20 subjects to have 10 participants. Working memory will be tested using delayed match sample task (DMS) and brief assessment of cognition in schizophrenia battery (BACS).

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) administration The patient would be transported from the inpatient unit to the TMS lab following screening and consent process. They would be accompanied by nursing staff. During their visit to the TMS lab a sample TMS session including motor threshold determination will be conducted. Subjects would be allowed to practice the DMS task to allow for the ceiling in practice effect of the task. The BACS would be administered before and after the TMS session.

Treatment Sessions Subjects would be administered left sided theta burst stimulation (TBS).The subject will be seated in a chair. A 64-channel electrode cap may be applied to the head for EEG recording. Electromyogram (EMG) electrodes will be applied to the right hand for motor evoked potential (MEP) recording. Subjects will perform the DMS task while sitting in the chair during the TMS session. EEG and EMG will be recorded throughout the treatment sessions. For theta burst stimulation the active motor threshold would be 80 % as used in most theta burst studies detailed in this review. Subjects would receive theta burst stimulation comprising 50 Hz bursts given at 3 to 5 Hz for close to 10 minutes which comprises 60 trains and 1800 pulses. The subject will be monitored until MEPs return to baseline. A side effects checklist will be completed at the beginning and at the end of the experimental session. All sessions will be performed by one of the protocol investigators, or by a trained and accredited research assistant supervised by the protocol investigators.

Clinical and cognitive assessments/tasks PANSS The Positive and negative symptoms scale is used to assess the severity of schizophrenia. It has three subscales - positive, negative and general psychopathology. Each of these subscales had 7 items, the maximum scores on each of these subscales in 49, minimum score being 7.

DMS task The DMS task is a modified version of the Sternberg task and has been adapted for use in cognitive paradigms accompanying transcranial magnetic stimulation. Each trial will last 13 s, with the following sequence of three task stages: encoding, retention and probe stages.

BACS - Tasks to be done from the actual BACS battery of tests List Learning (Verbal Memory). Patients are presented with 15 words and then asked to recall as many as possible. This procedure is repeated 5 times. There are two alternate forms.

Digit Sequencing Task (verbal working Memory). Patients are presented with clusters of numbers of increasing length. They are asked to tell the experimenter the numbers in order, from lowest to highest.

Token Motor Task (Motor Speed). Patients are given 100 plastic tokens and asked to place them into a container as quickly as possible for 60 seconds.

Verbal Fluency. Tests of Category Instances (Semantic Fluency) and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (Letter Fluency) are administered. Patients are given 60 seconds to name as many words as possible within a given semantic category, and in two separate trials, patients are given 60 seconds to generate as many words as possible that begin with a given letter. The total number of words from the three trials is the outcome measure.

Tower of London (Reasoning and Problem Solving). Patients look at two pictures simultaneously. Each picture shows 3 different-colored balls arranged on 3 pegs, with the balls in a unique arrangement in each picture. The patients are told about the rules in the task and are asked to provide the least number of times the balls in one picture would have to be moved to make the arrangement of balls identical to that of the other, opposing picture. There are two alternate forms.

Symbol Coding (Attention and Processing Speed). As quickly as possible, patients write numerals 1-9 as matches to symbols on a response sheet for 90 seconds.

Each of the six measures are compared to a healthy control sample to create z-scores, and a composite score is calculated by summing these z-scores and calculating a z-score of that sum. The composite score has high test-retest reliability in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls (ICCs \> .80).",COMPLETED,,2017-10-24,2018-06-30,2018-06-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,6,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Theta Burst Stimulation"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Transcranial magnetic stimulation with theta burst stimulation"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE,theta burst stimulation,1

The study will assess the acute and chronic safety of the procedure as well as the reduction in 24-hour ambulatory mean systolic blood pressure from baseline to 3 months after the procedure.","Nearly half of adults in the United States (108 million, or 45%) have hypertension defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg or are taking medication for hypertension. Hypertension is associated with cardiovascular and renal pathologies and leads to death if not treated appropriately. The cardiovascular risk factor doubles with each 20/10 mm Hg elevation in BP values above 115/75 mm Hg.

The current first-line therapy for hypertension involves change in life-style (i.e., diet and exercise) and various medications. However, only about 1 in 4 treated adults (24%) with hypertension have their condition under control. Thus, they are at increased risk for the major side effects of chronically elevated blood pressure, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal disease and heart failure. High blood pressure was a primary or contributing cause of death for more than 494,873 people in the United States in 2018, and was estimated to affect around 1.13 billion people worldwide and resulted in approximately 10 million deaths worldwide, in 2015.

About half of adults (45%) with uncontrolled hypertension have a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, now defined as Stage 2 hypertension. This includes 37 million U.S. adults. About 30 million adults are recommended to take medication. Almost two out of three of this group (19 million) have a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher. The other 17 million adults are taking medications but are unable to lower their blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg and are thus at increased risk for the risks associated with uncontrolled high blood pressure9. High blood pressure costs the United States about $131 billion each year, averaged over 12 years from 2003 to 2014.

In the past decade, several devices were developed in order to target the autonomic nervous system and lower BP in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. These devices aim to provide additional treatment option for patients who do not respond to antihypertensive medication. These devices target other BP regulating mechanisms such as baroreflex activation, deep brain stimulation carotid body ablation, direct vagus nerve stimulation, cardiac neuromodulation, central iliac arteriovenous coupler as well as other devices are currently under research, however, there is no medical device that has been approved so far.

The Therapeutic Intra Vascular UltraSound (TIVUS™) System is designed for renal artery nerve ablation using transluminal ultrasound (US). The TIVUS™ System is a high intensity, non-focused, ultrasound catheter system, which enables remote, localized, controlled, and repeatable thermal modulation of nerves adjacent to arterial vessel wall for performing safe and effective therapeutic artery sympathetic denervation.

OTHER,NCT05731479,Radiofrequency Diathermy and Therapeutic Exercise Protocol in Women With Abdominal Diastasis,Effectiveness of a Radiofrequency Diathermy and Therapeutic Exercise Protocol in Women With Abdominal Diastasis. Randomized Controlled Trial,"Diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) is defined as the presence of divergence between the rectus abdominis muscles along the linea alba. DRA is associated with decreased abdominal strength and degraded health and physical functioning, which results in poorer body perception and satisfaction and negatively affects the quality of life in its multiple spheres (social, sexual and personal). Regarding the different treatment techniques for DRA, different treatments have been described, such as bandages, electrotherapy or therapeutic exercise, the latter being the most scientifically supported option to approach DRA conservatively. Exercise has shown positive effects on DRA severity, abdominal muscle thickness, abdominal strength and endurance, and quality of life in women with DRA.

Another treatment that has shown promising effects in various pathologies is radiofrequency diathermy using the Capacitive-Resistive Electrical Transfer system. The capacitive mode acts on soft tissues containing electrolytes such as muscles and vascular and lymphatic tissues. On the other hand, the resistive mode acts on tissues of higher density and fat and fiber content, such as bones, ligaments and tendons. It has been documented that this type of therapy acts favoring the vascularization of tissues, decreasing inflammation and favoring the processes of cellular repair and analgesia. Its beneficial effect on low back pain and various pelvic floor disorders has been studied. However, at present, there are no studies evaluating the effectiveness of this type of intervention in people with abdominal diastasis.

In view of the above, the objective of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a protocol based on therapeutic exercise preceded by a radiofrequency diathermy program on anthropometric parameters, anatomo-physiological parameters, functional parameters, and parameters related to psychological aspects in women with postpartum abdominal diastasis.","A longitudinal randomized controlled experimental study will be carried out.

The first method, termed the ""GT method"" uses a commercially available rotary file system to instrument the root canal systems from the crown to the apical portion of the root. After completion of this technique, the apical portion of the root is prepared to the same standardized ISO size #20 in all roots (i.e., 0.2 mm cross-sectional diameter). The second method, termed the ""Lightspeed method"" uses a different commercially available rotary file system to shape the root canal systems from the apical to the crown portion of the root. After completion of this technique, the apical preparation is often larger in cross-sectional diameter than that observed after the GT method; however, an equally important distinction is that the Lightspeed method customizes the final cross-sectional diameter for each root canal system, and thus each root has a similar enlargement of apical preparation size due to proportionate removal of infected dentin at the end of the root. Although the Lightspeed method may result in reduced bacteria in the apical portion of root canal systems, there is no evidence to date that this effect improves clinical success rates.

OTHER,NCT04482179,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Constraint Induced Language Therapy for Alzheimer Disease,"A Phase II, Randomized, Blinded Study of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Constraint Induced Language Therapy for the Treatment of Chronic Aphasia - Alzheimer Disease Sub-study","Impaired verbal communication is a cardinal symptom of Alzheimer Disease (AD) and the source of enormous distress and disability. Effective therapies for this deficit are lacking. In light of the emerging literature demonstrating that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) improves general cognition in subjects with Alzheimer Disease (AD), the investigators propose to study the effectiveness of TMS as a therapy for impaired verbal communication. The hypothesis to be tested is that TMS combined with Constraint Induced Language Therapy (CILT) improves verbal communication more than sham TMS and CILT. A second aim is to use state-of-the-art neuroimaging to understand the mechanisms underlying any beneficial effect of the treatment.","TMS is a technique by which a brief electrical current is induced in brain tissue causing a brief suppression of the excitability of the underlying tissue; the technique, which was introduced in the 1980s and has been extensively used around the world, has been shown to transiently improve or disrupt specific cognitive operations. To achieve this end, a coil is positioned against the subject's head. The delivery of a single pulse begins with the discharge of current from a capacitor into a circular or figure-of-eight coil; this electrical current generates a brief magnetic field of up to 2.2 Tesla. As the pulse of electricity has a rise time of 0.2 ms. and a duration of 1 ms., the magnetic field changes in intensity quite rapidly. Because the magnetic field passes freely through the scalp, skull, and meninges, the flux in the magnetic field induces a small electric field in the brain that transiently alters neural activity.

TMS may be delivered in a variety of ways. The investigators propose to use 10 Hz TMS; that is, TMS pulses will be delivered at a frequency of 10/second, for a total of 1200 pulses. Using the figure-of-eight coil to be employed here, TMS is thought to affect activity in approximately 1 cubic cm. of cortex. Many investigators have employed TMS for AD with a frequency of 10 Hz and most have delivered 1200 pulses per session.

The baseline phase will consist of 3 sessions, each lasting 1-2 hours depending on the stamina of the subject. The point of the baseline testing is to characterize the subject's language function. To that end, a number of standard language and neuropsychological tasks will be administered. These include the Western Aphasia Battery, Pyramids and Palm Trees test, Figural Fluency Test, word and non-word repetition tasks, spontaneous narrative production, CILT stimulus naming, and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Additionally, during the baseline, subjects will undergo MRI of the brain or, if they have a contraindication to MRI, a CAT scan of the head. No contrast will be used.

In the treatment phase, there will be 10 TMS sessions over 2 consecutive weeks in which 30 two-second stimulation trains of 10 Hz TMS will be delivered every 30 seconds to the left inferior pars triangularis and to the left posterior superior left temporal gyrus at 100% motor threshold. There will be a total of 600 pulses to each site in each session for a total of 1200 pulses per session. Each TMS treatment session will be immediately followed by a 60-90 minute session of CILT.

There will be two 3-month post-treatment visits and two 6-month post-treatment visits in which the full battery of language and cognitive assessments will be repeated. Subjects who are able to undergo MRI scanning will have anatomic and fMRI scans at the first 6-month post-treatment visit.

The investigators will pair TMS with CILT which has been shown to have positive outcomes in post-stroke aphasia. CILT invokes use-dependent learning in communicative interactions by requiring spoken output and restricting use of alternative forms of communication, such as gestures. The investigators will use a dual card-matching task modeled after Maher et al. As in the original CILT design, the participant interacts verbally with a conversational partner (here, the speech language pathologist), in turn requesting a card of given description and complying with the partner's request. In this way, the treatment targets both production and comprehension. Moreover, as verbal targets increase in linguistic complexity across the protocol (""a ball"", ""throw a ball""; ""Do you have a ball""?), a variety of lexical and phrasal structures are targeted.

In recent studies, it has been shown that surgical treatment in proximal humerus fractures has a high complication rate and is also not superior to conservative treatments in terms of functional results. Therefore, the importance of conservative treatment is increasing day by day in this group of fractures, especially in elderly patients with high risk for surgery.

In these studies in the literature, the method in conservative treatment is not clearly specified, and the investigator will apply 3 different bandages to adjust the rotation of the shoulder in 3 different ways during the investigators' conservative treatment. The investigator will compare functional and radiological results between these groups.","Proximal humerus fractures, who are admitted to the investigators' emergency department and are decided to follow conservative follow-up criteria, will be given one of 3 different bandages (velpau bandage, classical shoulder arm sling, 30 degree padded shoulder arm sling) according to the previous randomization.

At the end of the second week, which is absolute immobilization, elbow and wrist movements will begin. Afterwards, in the 6th week, according to the state of union with deltoid strengthening, passive and active shoulder joint range of motion exercises will be started.

At the end of the 12th month, the follow-up will be terminated, and in this control, the existing joint movements will be recorded by measuring the degrees of anterior elevation, abduction, external rotation in neutral, external rotation at 90 degrees and internal rotation. In addition, in this control, the values will be noted by taking the Constant, ASES, DASH and VAS Scores.

After all these values are noted for all 3 groups, statistical analysis between groups will be made for each variable and the result will be given.

In addition, if complications(non-union,mal-union,stiffness etc.) occur during conservative follow-up in the investigators' patients, they will be recorded and whether there is a statistically significant difference in complications between the groups will be investigated.

The investigators' aim in this study is to understand whether any of these 3 different bandage types, which are routinely used as an immobilization method in proximal humerus fractures, are superior to the other.

A study comparing immobilization methods could not be found in the literature. These bandage types, which have not been compared with their effectiveness, are used effectively all over the world.

ST does not have the volatile constituents and carbon monoxide (CO) that are found in cigarette smoke. Since ST is not smoked there would be less risk of cardiovascular and lung disease. In addition the harm associated with second hand smoke would be eliminated. Although the health risks are reduced in ST users, they still exist due to the presence of nitrosamines found in ST. A better approach would be to use nicotine replacement that did not contain carcinogens, however the cost of such NRT could be prohibitive especially in third world countries where the rate of smoking is continuing to rise and the per capita income is much lower than in the United States.

Purpose: The goal of this study is to evaluate the health effects of Camel Snus, the new oral tobacco product produced by RJ Reynolds and Taboka, produced by Phillip Morris. These products are pasteurized rather than fermented and contain less moisture to eliminate spitting. They are marketed as an alternative to cigarette smoking.","Cigarette smokers (n=125) will be recruited from the local metropolitan area using multiple media outlets.

The main question it aims to answer is:

Are high-tech rehabilitation interventions, including robotic systems, virtual reality, and stabilometric platforms, not inferior to traditional rehabilitation methods in improving balance, motor function, fatigue levels, sarcopenia, cognitive engagement, and overall quality of life in patients with chronic neuromuscular diseases (NMDs)? Researchers will compare a robotic treatment group, that consists in an high-tech rehabilitation, with a control group, that will receive the traditional rehabilitative treatment.","Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a novel rehabilitation protocol integrating advanced technologies in the treatment of chronic neuromuscular diseases (NMDs).

Background: NMDs affect muscle function and are directly controlled by the nervous system. Traditional rehabilitation often falls short in addressing the multifaceted needs of NMD patients. This gap underscores the necessity for innovative rehabilitation approaches that can significantly enhance the quality of life and optimize recovery outcomes following acute events.

Methods: The protocol integrates advanced technologies to address the rehabilitation needs of patients with chronic NMDs. It utilizes robotic systems to ensure consistent and precise movement, virtual reality for immersive and engaging therapy, and stabilometric platforms to enhance balance training. The focus is on chronic NMDs such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIPD) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT). The approach emphasizes rapid rehabilitation to maximize recovery outcomes.

Study Design: An interventional, randomized, pragmatic trial with a parallel assignment. The trial aims to compare the efficacy of high-tech rehabilitation methods against conventional treatments in improving patient outcomes.

Outcome Measures: To assess the improvement of at least 10 points in balance measured using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) from baseline to the end of the treatment period comparing the high-tech rehabilitation circuit with standard rehabilitation protocol. Conclusion: This protocol seeks to determine if high-tech rehabilitation interventions can outperform traditional methods in chronic NMDs.

These tools can be used to help in the fight against vector borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. However, their efficacy in reducing mosquito biting and therefore malaria transmission has never been evaluated in Africa. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a spatial repellent in reducing mosquito biting on human beings and measure the impact any reduced biting will have on malaria transmission. The investigators will recruit and follow-up 5,984 children between 6 months and \<10 years of age in Busia County to determine how many times they will be infected with malaria in villages where the investigators will have distributed spatial repellents and compare the rate of infection to villages where the investigators will not have distributed the repellent devices. Additionally, the investigators will measure whether the distribution of spatial repellents in one village will drive mosquitoes to their neighboring houses thereby increasing malaria transmission in those areas. The children participating in the study will be divided into 3 groups (cohorts). The first group will be followed up during the first 4 months before any intervention is distributed and the purpose here will be to determine that the villages are comparable. After this, the investigators will recruit the next group of participants and follow them up for 1 year and repeat this again for another year. During the follow-up, the children will be asked to come to the health facility where they will be tested for malaria using RDT or blood slide for microscopy. Every two weeks, a member of the study team will come to the participant's house and ask them if they had any history of fever. If the participants had fever, they will be tested for malaria. All children who turn out to be positive for malaria by RDT will be treated free of charge. At the same time, the investigators shall also perform mosquito collections to determine the impact of spatial repellents on the density of Anopheles mosquitoes.","Spatial repellents (SRs) have been widely used for the prevention of mosquito bites but their protective efficacy (PE) in reducing mosquito-borne diseases has never been evaluated in Africa. To address this knowledge gap, western Kenya was selected as a site to estimate the impact of a transfluthrin-based spatial repellent on malaria-related outcomes in Busia County, where baseline malaria transmission ranges from 2.5 to 4.1 new infections per person per year.

A total of 5,984 children between 6 months and \<10 years of age will be enrolled in three separate cohorts (baseline, cohort 1 and cohort 2). A total of 2,040 children from among 60 clusters will be enrolled for a four-month baseline prior to placement of the SR intervention. After baseline, a total of 1,972 participants from among 58 clusters, will be enrolled into cohort 1 and followed for one year. Cohort 2, consisting of a total of 1,972 children, will be enrolled from among 58 clusters to provide a total of two years of follow up. Children who have been selected for inclusion in the baseline cohort will be eligible for selection to cohort 1 or 2 but not both.

Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 during intervention will be split into two groups, one to estimate the direct effect of the SR (total of 1,624 children, 812 per follow up year) and a second to estimate the degree of diversion (or mass effect) of mosquitoes and malaria transmission from persons protected by the SR to persons who are unprotected (total of 2,320 children, 1,160 per follow up year). All cohorts will be followed once every two weeks with finger prick blood samples taken once every 4 weeks to test for malaria or whenever a participant reports a recent (within 48 hours) history of fever.

The incidence of malaria in the baseline cohort will be used to validate underlying assumptions prior to intervention. The incidence of malaria in each cohort followed with intervention will be estimated and compared to determine the benefit of using an SR in an area with high, year-round transmission of malaria. Monthly collections of mosquitoes using CDC light traps will be conducted to determine if there are entomological correlates of SR efficacy that may be useful for the evaluation of new SR products.

While troponin measurement is highly sensitive for myocardial necrosis it has several limitations that influence its clinical use. First, since the troponin test is reliable only after 4-6 hours from symptoms onset, it has only limited value in the assessment of patients presenting earlier. Second, several clinical situations, most commonly renal dysfunction, are associated with increased troponin level and therefore may decrease the specificity of the test. Third, since troponin rise indicates myocardial infarction it is not useful in the common situations where there is myocardial ischemia without necrosis.

The P53 is a tumor suppressing gene activated in different stressful situations including hypoxia. This activation is associated with accelerated transcription (up to 30-50 folds from baseline) of different genes that are involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and in stopping the cell cycle. A study on pregnant women demonstrated high levels of fetal mRNA of these genes in maternal circulation. This gene expression correlated with other signs of fetal stress associated with hypoxia.

Certain guidelines specifically recommend taking 10,000 steps per day for a goal. Some of pedometers have a function of energy expenditure estimation in addition to counting steps. However, the EE derived from pedometers is the indirect estimation calculated from metabolic calculations instead of direct measurement.The purpose of this study was to measure the actual energy expenditure (EE) using indirect calorimetry for the 10,000 steps goal, and compared to the estimated EE using predictive equation.

Twenty healthy college volunteers were recruited. First, height and weight were measured from each subject. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio of weight to height in meters squared. We used BioScan 920 to get all subjects' body composition data including fat mass and fat-free mass. Followed by measurements of basic characteristics, all subjects wore the pedometer and walked 10,000 steps on the treadmill. The walking speeds ranged from 3.0 to 4.0 miles per hour (mph) according to different gender. The speed of 4.0 mph was set for male and 3.0 mph was set for female. If the subject could'nt follow the pre-set speed, he/she could walk with self-comfortable speed but the speed should be in the range of 3.0 to 4.0 mph defined as moderate intensity of ACSM's recommendation. Subjects rested on the chair with back support for 3 minutes and then completed the 10,000 steps goal. After recovery for 3 minutes, the data collection was finished. The stopping criteria of the test were as follows: dizziness, nausea, dyspnea, or leg fatigue which leads subjects unable to continue. Expired gas was collected using the Cosmed K4b2 portable indirect calorimetry system, and EE was monitored breath-by-breath according to the following formula:

EE (Kcal/min)= 3.781×VO2＋1.237×VCO2

where VO2 represents the standardized oxygen consumption per minute, and VCO2 is the carbon dioxide production per minute. Estimated EE was calculated by the predictive equation published by ACSM:

VO2 (ml/kg/min)= 0.1×S (m/min)＋1.8×S×G (%)＋3.5

where S represents the walking speed, and G is the walking grade.

The total walking duration and distance for taking 10,000 steps were also recorded. Pulmonary function tests were performed on the other day to get each subject's functional vital capacity (FVC). We used this parameter to estimate subject's predicted maximal minute ventilation (predicted max VE) according to the equation provided in the guidelines of American Thoracic Society (ATS) for cardiopulmonary exercise testing:

VE (L/min)= 26.3×VC-34

where VC represents vital capacity. The ratio of averaged VE during walking and predicted maximal VE was calculated to determine the level of exercise intensity for taking 10,000 steps.",COMPLETED,,2008-11,2009-02,2009-02,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,20,ACTUAL,[],,,1

Multiple studies have found altered endometrial histology and gene expression following controlled ovarian stimulation.

PTEC cycles require cryopreservation of the entire 2pn oocyte cohort in the prior cycle. Once thawed, the embryos are cultured to the blastocyst stage before transfer.

In typical cycles using frozen-thawed embryos, many thawed embryos that appear to survive do not actually resume and continue development. PTEC ensures the transfer of embryos that resumed development and continued developing at least to the blastocyst stage (4-5 days post-thaw).

Despite this lack of consensus and the lack of available literature on comparative data to guide treatment for this patient population, operative treatment with plate fixation has gained popularity. The aim of this study is to compare the functional outcome of open reduction and plate fixation with closed reduction and plaster immobilisation in adult patients (18-75 years) with displaced complete articular distal radius fractures.","Distal radius fractures account for 17% of all fractures diagnosed. Two third of those fractures are displaced and need to be reduced.

According to the Dutch National Guidelines, displaced distal radius fractures, after adequate reduction confirmed on X-ray, are best treated nonoperatively with cast immobilization. Moreover, the AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline only suggest surgical fixation when the articular step, after reduction, exceeds 2mm. However, both recommendations are based on studies who did not differentiate between intra- and extra-articular distal radius fractures. So, no clear consensus about the best treatment for patients with displaced intra-articular distal radius fractures can be made. Despite this lack of consensus and the lack of available literature on comparative data to guide treatment for this patient population, a rise in use of volar plating has been observed.

The goal of open reduction and plate fixation is to restore articular congruity and axial alignment, and to enable early post-operative movement. Several studies show good radiological and functional results using the volar locking plate in unstable displaced distal radius fractures.

No studies have been carried out to assess whether operative treatment with plate fixation is superior in displaced complete articular distal radius fractures to nonoperative treatment in patients with these fracture type.

This study aims to evaluate the use of BFR training in conjunction with traditional ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction rehabilitation in adolescents.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the addition of BFR-based exercise to traditional methods of physical therapy. Does the use of BFR-based exercise improve strength, hypertrophy, functional and patient reported outcomes after ACL Reconstruction in the adolescent population?","The planned pilot study is a prospective case control study utilizing retrospective controls. The investigators will compare the use of exercises augmented with BFR with quantitative measurements of strength and patient reported outcomes. A total of 20 youth and adolescent patients undergoing a surgical procedure for ACL reconstruction at Connecticut Children's Elite Sports Medicine and completing physical therapy at Connecticut Children's Sports Physical Therapy will be recruited for this study. A review of data from 20 previous patients, matched for age, sex, BMI and surgical procedure that completed physical therapy at Connecticut Children's Sports Physical Therapy will be used as a comparison.

As part of this pilot study, the investigators will additionally collect prospective controls. This population will be patients not participating in physical therapy at Connecticut Children's, but underwent ACL reconstruction by Elite Sports Medicine. The investigators are unsure of the ability for us to collect prospective controls in a timely manner, hence the investigators will use the above described retrospective cohort as controls if the prospective controls prove difficult to recruit.

Identification and Recruitment:

All potential patients undergoing ACL reconstruction at Elite Sports Medicine will be approached for participation for this study. Eligible patients will be identified at their initial pre-operative appointment with the Sports Medicine Physician, Athletic Trainer, and Sports Physical Therapy Physical Therapist. Subject selection will be completed by those patients meeting the above outlined inclusion and exclusion criteria. At this time, the study purpose and protocol will be explained and a brief summary of the study will be provided.

Consent: Consent will take place at the pre-operative visit. The patient/parent will be given a detailed description of the purpose and methodology for this study. The participants will have the opportunity to read the consent forms and ask any questions they may have about the research. If the patients agree to participate, they will be asked to sign the consent form and a copy will be provided.

Retention: Eligible patients will be required to be seen for a minimum of 90% of patient visits to be included in this study.

In addition to the standard ACL protocol, patients in this study will utilize the Owen Recovery Science exercise protocol for BFR \[18\]. The following guidelines will be followed concerning exercise progression, occlusion pressure and difficulties with volume achievement. To determine the appropriate resistance for each exercise, the patient's 1 repetition maximum (1RM) will be attained using a repetition test \[19\]. This test will use a previously validated algorithm to determine the 1RM based on the weight used to perform a 7-10 repetition test \[20\]. Patient will perform the exercise with a weight they can comfortably lift for several repetitions. Based on the weight or resistance used, and the patient's perceived exertion a 1RM will be estimated using the modified OMNI-RES (OMNI perceived exertion scale for resistance). The starting load for each exercise will be 20-30% of their 1RM , or bodyweight resistance will be used when loading is not feasible.

OTHER,NCT03517579,Personalized Treatment in Thyroid Disorders,Personalized Treatment Planning for Radio-iodine Therapy of Thyroid Disease,"The Collar Therapy Indicator (CoTI) (A device that is placed in collar around the neck resembling a turtle neck sweater collar with a wire and recording box) has been shown in a single small previously published experience to provide data regarding radioiodine exposure that correlates with conventional methods of measuring I-123 and I-131 uptakes after diagnostic dose administration and/or therapy for thyroid disorders. We hypothesize that the device's continuous measurement capability will permit more accurate estimates of radiation exposure to thyroid tissue than conventionally employed methods assessing fractional uptake at one or a few time points. It may also provide information about the extent of variability in the absorbed radiation dose among patients with thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. By providing more complete information about individual patient's exposures, it will facilitate more accurate estimation of the administered I-131 dose requirements for control of hyperthyroidism and thyroid remnant ablation while reducing the need for repeated visits to the clinic for dosimetry measurements. The aims of our project include the following: (1)To compare quantitative imaging-derived thyroid time activity curve to that obtained using the CoTI and to determine the extent to which there is variability in radiation dose predicted using conventional methods to that predicted from measurement of the full Time-Activity Curve (TAC).(2) Evaluate the uptake and clearance kinetics across the 5 patients in each category as proof of principle for a potential larger trial to investigate use of this device in optimizing the administered doses of radioactive iodine to achieve therapeutic goals while minimizing risks of comorbidities, such a post-radioiodine hypothyroidism in patients with Graves' disease.(3)Evaluate patient experience, convenience, and discomfort in using the CoTI device with a survey instrument.","Radioiodine treatment for thyroid disorders represented an early example of individualized medicine. Since its introduction 80 years ago, the therapeutic I-131 dosage has usually been tailored to individual patient requirements based on the uptake of a tracer radioiodine dose. Various techniques have been employed to estimate the administered dose of I-131 for optimal therapeutic benefit. Estimated exposure has typically been extrapolated from the results of activity measurements at one or two time points, e.g., at 4 and 24 hours. We now know that treatment of hyperthyroid Graves' disease with these methods lead to a 13-25% rate of failure to cure hyperthyroidism and a 46-80% rate of long-term hypothyroidism in cured patients. Similarly, such relatively crude dosimetry doubtless result in significant overtreatment in the case of remnant ablation for differentiated thyroid cancer.

For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer requiring remnant ablation, the administered activity has, in most cases, been derived empirically, ranging between 30-100 mci. The high success rates in ablating remnant thyroid tissue implies that many patients are still treated with higher 131-I doses than required, with potential side effects, such as radiation sialadenitis.

Pilot Study Rationale; Our overall objective is to provide the optimal dose to each patient. This study will apply a novel ""wearable"" radiation detection technology to determine continuous cervical measurements over days following tracer radioiodine administration will provide information that permits the tailoring of subsequent therapeutic radioiodine doses more precisely to improve clinical outcomes, as described above.

The actual therapeutic dose decisions in this pilot trial, however, will not be based on the collar device measurements. Patients with Graves' disease will receive 180-200 µCi I-131 per gram of estimated gland mass based on the conventional method of dose calculation, based on a 24-hour % uptake and gland volume. Most patients with thyroid cancer would receive the 30 mCi dose for remnant ablation prior to the placement of the COTI device, as per the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This will be an unmasked prospective pilot study involving patients with Graves' disease (Group I) and differentiated thyroid cancer (Group II). Five patients in each group will have radiation activity measurements using the COTI devise. All persons in the study will receive 131-I treatment based on the current standards of care for dose estimation.

Study Device; The CoTI has 3 components;

* A collar unit: a gamma detector wrapped around a body part-neck in this case and contains a scintillating crystal and a silicon photomultiplier. The photon pulse signal is then converted to digital signals (measuring the counts per second). Usually two detectors are placed in specified positions.
* A cable that connects the collar unit to the Control Unit
* A control unit that collects the signals and transmits it wirelessly to a hand-held computer tablet.

Two types of collar devices will be used: the lower activity and the medium activity

1. Lower activity collar for patients with Graves' disease as well as diagnostic I-123 scan in thyroid cancer patients. These patients typically receive 0.2-1.2 m Ci of I-123/I-131.
2. Medium activity collar for Patients with thyroid cancer after 131-I ablation, for which patients typically receive 30-100 mci of I-131.

Study Population;

* Group I: Patients with diffuse toxic goiter (Graves' disease) diagnosed clinically with no prior history of radioiodine treatment.
* Group II: Patients with differentiated epithelial thyroid cancer who are s/p total thyroidectomy and candidates for remnant ablation based on ATA guidelines.

IRB approval and HIPPA regulations; Since it is a project involving a medical device which will be applied to the patients' neck, it will require the following;

1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) regular approval.
2. Registry into ClinicalTrials.gov.
3. Appropriate forms and consent process for the patients. The recruitment of subjects for the study;

   * Informed consent including the benefits and the risks of the Collar device (CoTI) will be obtained.
   * Confidentiality agreement would be signed regarding the CoTI and its application.
   * Demographic, clinical and tumor characteristics of the participants will be obtained, as outlined below.
   * The instructions on the application CoTI will be provided in detail.
   * Instructions regarding communication in the event of any difficulties will be provided.

Preparation the patient;

1. The patients will be prepared by general standards of care prior to CoTI placement. For patients with Graves' disease, any thionamide anti-thyroid meds will be stopped 3-5 days prior to I-123 diagnostic dose administration. After obtaining written consent, a venous blood sample will be obtained for work for requisite laboratory evaluation for baseline labs, as outlined below, and in women, for a pregnancy test. A (low activity) CoTI device will be placed under supervision and then adjusted for comfort and optimal activity measurement as a trial and then removed. Background activity of the patient, a phantom, and the device itself will be measured. After administration of I-123, an initial uptake at time 0 will be obtained. The CoTI device will then be placed and the patient will be asked to return to the clinic at scheduled imaging times for Group I. Anatomical localization of the CoTI in all patients will be standardized by pen markings.
2. Patients with Graves' disease, who will be administered 200 µCi of I-131 and fitted with a low-activity CoTI device after administration of the dose. Background activity of the patient, a phantom and the device itself will be measured prior to placement of the device. After administration of I-131, an initial uptake at time 0 will be obtained. The CoTI device will then be placed and the patient will be asked to come back at scheduled imaging times for Group II. Anatomical localization for the CoTI for all patients will be standardized by markings.
3. Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer will be placed on a low iodine diet for one week. Recombinant TSH will be administered on days 1 and 2 (typically Monday and Tuesday), and the diagnostic I-123 dosage will be administered on day 2. As per the protocol standard of care, the diagnostic whole-body scan is done on day 3 and the I-131 dose for I-131 ablation (30-100 mci) is administered on day 4.

After obtaining written consent, venous blood sample will be obtained for work for requisite laboratory evaluation for baseline labs as outlined below, including in women, a pregnancy test prior to the I-131 remnant ablation dose. The (medium activity) CoTI device will be placed under supervision and then adjusted for convenience as outlined above. Background activity of the patient, a phantom, and the device itself will be measured. After administration of I-131, an initial uptake at time 0 will be obtained. The CoTI device will then be placed and the patient will be asked to come back at scheduled imaging times for Group II. Anatomical localization for the CoTI for all patients will be standardized by markings.

OTHER,NCT06157879,Measuring Electrical Properties of Breast Tissues,Measuring Electrical Properties of Breast Tissues,The goal of this observational study is to use a low-powered microwave imaging system to provide insight into the correlation of electrical properties of breast tissue at microwave frequencies and breast density obtained from mammograms in healthy women between the ages of 18 and 74. The main questions it aims to answer : • Is there a correlation between the electrical properties of breast tissue and breast density obtained from mammograms? Both breasts of each participant will be scanned by the microwave imaging system six times in total.,"A new approach to imaging that uses low-power microwaves to scan the breast has been developed. Since the imaging system uses low power, there is no risk of tissue heating. The imaging system places the sensors in contact with the breast and does not require compression. The research team at the University of Calgary has previously developed microwave imaging systems that have been tested on volunteers and patients. This included repeated scanning of a group of volunteers to evaluate the consistency of the approach. The information collected from experiences scanning volunteers and patients have been reviewed and translated into a next-generation imaging system design. Aspects of this system have been further improved by Wave View Imaging, which is a company formed by members of the University's research team.

The proposed study involves collecting electrical property measurements of breast tissues and comparing these measurements to clinical information. The investigators also aim to compare regions of interest in the microwave scans with regions of interest in the mammograms. This includes regions dominated by fibroglandular tissues, as well as regions of interest that correspond to anomalies identified in the mammograms

The plan is to scan both breasts of up to 200 volunteers. Each volunteer will participate in a single scanning session. Breast tissue composition (VOLPARA score) will be compared with the microwave properties and registration of mammograms with microwave images will be performed for a more detailed comparison.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2024-05-27,2025-05-01,2024-11-18,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,OTHER,50,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""WVI-MIS-01-2022"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Microwave scans"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE,wvi-mis-01-2022,0

It is not known whether pain interferes with an individuals performance in PR, or whether PR aggravates or relieves pain. Individuals with COPD who report chronic pain and those without pain will be enrolled in the study.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a systemic disease associated with dyspnea, fatigue, and poor health-related quality of life. COPD is further complicated by the presence of pain which may be attributed to common comorbidities such as musculoskeletal conditions (osteoarthritis, osteoporosis), cardiac disease or diabetes. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is the cornerstone of treatment for COPD however the impact of pain on PR has not been explored. It is unclear whether those experiencing chronic pain achieve a similar, lesser or greater degree of benefit compared to those without pain, or whether exercise training exacerbates symptoms. Gaining a greater understanding of the effects of an outpatient PR program on pain will provide direction into future specific treatment options which may necessary for managing chronic pain as part of PR.

Individuals with COPD who are beginning an out-patient PR program will be enrolled in the study. Those who report the presence of chronic pain will be classed as the pain group; those who report the absence of chronic pain will be classed as the comparator group. All participants will complete a 6-minute walk test and a Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRDQ) at the beginning of the PR program. These measures will be repeated at the end of the 8-week PR program for all participants. All participants will be asked to report their level of pain using a visual analogue scale every two weeks during the PR program.

However, static airway pressure does not reflect alveolar pressure at all. Airway pressure is supposed to completely interrupt the communication between proximal airway opening and the distal alveolar and/or small airway structures. In this condition, some alveoli may still be inflated but do not communicate with proximal airways and auto-PEEP will give a biased estimated of mean alveolar pressure. To be note, distinguishing the airway closure and alveolar collapse can be challenging at times. The quasi-static PV curve is a useful bedside tool to set mechanical ventilation, which may help us to identify the airway closure and alveolar collapse.

The overall objective is to provide data to assess the feasibility of implementing a future randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of the PDDM on the management of non-specific LBP in a clinical setting and to explore the short-term effect of using the model on patient's clinical outcomes.","Background: Non-specific mechanical low back pain (LBP) is highly prevalent, recurrent and is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite increased efforts in improving care, the self-reported levels of disability in individuals with LBP have not improved in the last decade. In order to more effectively manage LBP through non-pharmacological approaches, evidence endorses the use of classification systems to support diagnosis and guide treatments. However, this approach to care is not without limitations and a more comprehensive and broader perspective is needed. Hence, we recently proposed and validated the Low Back Pain and Disability Drivers Management (PDDM) model, which aims to identify the domains influencing pain and disability to create a profile or phenotype to guide clinical decisions.

This feasibility study will assess recruitment and retention rates as well as PTs' acceptability and patients' satisfaction outcomes related to the intervention.

OTHER,NCT05506579,Prevention and Treatment of Injuries and Urinary Incontinence Among Norwegian Rhythmic Gymnasts,"Musculoskeletal Injuries, Pelvic Floor Dysfunctions and Menstrual Irregularities in Norwegian Rhythmic Gymnasts and Dancers - Observational and Cluster Randomized Controlled Studies","Overuse injuries are common among competitive Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts with a mean weekly prevalence of 37% \[95% CI: 36 - 39%\] and incidence of 4.2 new overuse injuries \[95% CI: 3.6 - 4.9\] per gymnast per year (Gram, M., Clarsen, B., \& Bø, K., 2021). The knees, lower back and hip/groin were the most common injury locations. It has been postulated that reduced physical capacity (e.g strength, flexibility, stability) in the knees, lower back and hip/groin can increase the risk of injuries in rhythmic gymnastics.

In addition, more than 30% of the Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts experience urinary incontinence (UI), and 70% reported that UI negatively affected sports performance (Gram, M., \& Bø, K., 2020). Few of the rhythmic gymnasts had any knowledge about the pelvic floor.

Hence, this assessor blinded cluster randomized controlled trial aims to find out whether the implementation of exercises targeting reduced physical capacity and pelvic floor dysfunction can prevent/reduce the prevalence of overuse injuries and UI.","BACKGROUND

Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts have high prevalence and incidence of overuse injuries. Previous research on risk factors related to injuries in rhythmic gymnastics (RG) has implied that high weekly training load, hypermobility, poor technic and inappropriate training load increase the risk of injuries. A prospective study also found that previous injury increased the risk of injuries substantially (Gram, M., Clarsen, B., \& Bø, K., 2021). Hence, injury prevention interventions should start at an early age to avoid the first injury. In addition, since the aetiology and mechanisms of injuries are multifactorial, with a well described complex interaction of internal and external risk factors making a gymnast more or less prone to sustain an injury, there might be a need to assess some internal risk factors more thoroughly. The modifiable internal risk factor physical capacity, e.g. strength, flexibility, stability, might be of particular interest, since lack of physical capacity can be thought of as a potential underlying cause in all of the above-mentioned risk factors. In addition, it is well known how persistent lack of physical capacity relative to the requirements in a sport might lead to injuries. With knees, lower back and hip/groin as the most commonly reported injury locations, clinical assessment of strength, flexibility and stability in these locations has been conducted in a cross-sectional study before this randomized controlled trial (RCT). Reduced physical capacity revealed in the cross-sectional study will be targeted/brought forward in the exercise program in the RCT.

The most common types of pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFD) are urinary incontinence (UI), anal incontinence (AI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). UI has high prevalence among female athletes participating in sports including jumping and running (high impact). A prevalence of 80% was found in young, nulliparous high-level trampoline jumpers in Sweden (Eliasson et.al., 2008). The prevalence among Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts was \>30%, while Thyssen et.al. found that 56% of female Danish artistic gymnasts and 43% of dancers reported UI. UI negatively affects sports performance, and symptoms at young age is a risk factor of future UI developing during pregnancy and after childbirth. Hence, interventions toward prevention and treatment is necessary. While strength training of the pelvic floor muscles has 1A level of evidence/recommendation to treat UI in the general female population, and has no known adverse effects, there is little knowledge of this among young female athletes and dancers. Search on PubMed revealed only one RCT assessing the effect of pelvic floor muscle training on UI in female athletes. Ferreira et.al. randomized 32 female volleyball players to 3 months of pelvic floor muscle training or control, and found statistically significant improvement in the exercise group in frequency of leakage and urine loss measured during physical activity(p\< 0.001). Hence, there seem to be a potential for prevention and treatment also in athletes exposed to heavy load towards the pelvic floor.

AIMS

The aims of this RCT are to investigate if implementation of prophylactic exercises targeting reduced capacity and pelvic floor dysfunction can prevent/lower the prevalence of overuse injuries and UI among Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS

These two supplements will contain equal amounts of protein but differ considerably in their amino acid contents. Whey protein is rich in essential amino acids whereas gelatin is rich in proline.

In obese individuals with METS, the hypotheses are:

OTHER,NCT04838379,Ultrasound Guided Rectus Sheath Block and Transversus Abdominis Plane Block,Perioperative Analgesic Effect of Preemptive Ultrasound Guided Rectus Sheath Block and Transversus Abdominis Plane Block With Dexmedetomidine vs Dexamethasone for Laparoscopic Surgery in Paediatrics,The current study aimed to assess the efficacy of Dexmedetomidine (DEX) and Dexamethasone as an adjuvant to ultrasound guided TAP and RS block to prolongation of postoperative analgesia and better pain control in children undergoing laparoscopic surgeries,"Laparoscopic surgeries are one of the most frequently performed paediatric surgeries . Although minimally invasive, this technique is still associated with a significant amount of pain and anxiety in children . Indeed, children who are highly anxious prior to surgery tend to have more postoperative pain, delayed hospital discharge, and higher incidence of emergence delirium, sleep disturbances, and other mal-adaptive behaviour changes that can last up to a few weeks following surgery . To improve analgesia and decrease postoperative anxiety in children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies multimodal approach for pain control can be employed.

Over the past years, the concept of pain management has extended from simply decreasing pain intensity to optimizing patient's condition. The goal is to decrease pain scores, stress response that should be avoided in patients, particularly cardiac patients, together with a decrease in analgesics-related adverse effects like nausea, vomiting, retention of urine and over sedation. By achieving these goals, we can certainly facilitate patient recovery and minimize the hospital stay. Improved pain control can be achieved by a combination of different types of regional analgesia with systemic analgesics. The main contributor to pain post abdominal operations is the pain from abdominal wall incision .

Many procedures were followed to decrease this intense postoperative pain such as, epidural catheter analgesia, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, local wound infiltration, Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA), peripheral nerve blocks, in addition to systemic administration of Non-Steroidal Anti- Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids .

The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a regional anesthetic technique that provides analgesia to the parietal peritoneum as well as to the skin and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall (9-10). Despite a relatively low risk of complications and a high success rate using modern techniques, TAP block remains overwhelmingly underused. Although the technique is technically straightforward, it has not been adopted in clinical practice .

Moreover, The Rectus Sheath Block (RSB) is one of these regional techniques that are suitable for operations with a midline incision or laparoscopic surgery with the main incision at the umbilical port. A previous study showed the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided rectus sheath block for laparoscopic appendectomy compared to a control group injected with saline instead of a local anesthetic Generally, in laparoscopic surgeries, the sites of port incision are associated with considerable postoperative discomfort. Thus, we performed TAP and RS block to ameliorate postoperative pain and improve patient outcomes. In addition to the usefulness of traditional local anesthetics to provide analgesia during the course of the postoperative period is restricted by their short duration of action .

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) and Dexamethasone has been shown as a valuable additives to local anesthetics in neuraxial blocks and peripheral nerve blocks leading to prolongation of postoperative analgesia and better pain control .

Dexmedetomidine (DEX) α-2 adrenergic receptor consists of three α-2 isoreceptors (α-2a, α-2b and α-2c), which regulate the various pharmacodynamic effects of this drug . The α-2a receptor seems to promote sedation and anxiolysis in the locus coeruleus, as well as to generate bradycardia and peripheral vasodilation by stimulation of the cerebral vasomotor center. The α-2b receptor prevents tremor, generates analgesia in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord and determines peripheral vasoconstriction. The α-2c receptor modulates the mental state .

Dexamethasone, a high-potency, long-acting glucocorticoid, has been shown to prolong peripheral nerve blockade . Dexamethasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors and inhibits potassium conductance, which decreases nociceptive C-fiber activity . Dexamethasone may also extend the duration of analgesia via local vasoconstrictive and systemic anti-inflammatory effects .

Thus, we performed TAP and RS block to ameliorate postoperative pain and improve patient outcomes.

While it has been shown in previous studies that misoprostol is efficacious for most of the above-mentioned indications, it is less well-established that the treatment for suspected postpartum RPOC alters the natural course of events and reduces the number of patients requiring surgical intervention and actually having RPOC.

RPOC is estimated to complicate about 1% of term pregnancies and is more prevalent than after miscarriages and termination of pregnancy (5).

The diagnosis and treatment of RPOC might be challenging, as there are no clearly determined diagnostic criteria, evidence-based guidelines or treatment protocols (6).

Different protocols for the follow-up and treatment of cases suspected of RPOC are in use worldwide, including expectant management, administrating uterotonics, performing suction curettage (6), and performing hysteroscopy (7, 8). Evidence in the literature supports the treatment of RPOC with operative hysteroscopy since curettage seems to increase the risk for intrauterine adhesions and Asherman syndrome (9, 10) with the possibility for menstrual abnormalities, infertility or subfertility, recurrent pregnancy losses, preterm labor, and preterm premature rupture of membranes (11).

Chambers et al published in 2009 a 6-year trial (12), which shows that treatment with 200 mcg SL / PO misoprostol 3 times daily for 2 days may effectively treat RPOC and reduce repeat curettage rate by 79.6%. There was also the complete resolution of symptoms in 93%, and 77% of women reported a high level of satisfaction. The trial was retrospective and RPOC was not confirmed by hysteroscopy or histology.

The main tool for diagnosis and follow-up in cases of RPOC is postpartum ultrasound, showing low, medium, and high probability for residua, with the clinical symptoms of abnormal bleeding pattern, abdominal tenderness, and persistently dilated cervix.

We've decided to set the categories according to the study by Smorgick (13), although we chose to name them and treat them differently. The categories are:

1. Low probability for residua - ultrasound shows thin regular endometrial line 10 mm and below, with no intrauterine mass or Doppler vascular flow.

   In effect a normal ultrasound scan.
2. Medium probability for residua - ultrasound shows a cavity over 10 mm, intrauterine hypo / hyperechogenic mass, or irregular endometrial line without Doppler flow. With this group, PROC cannot be excluded.
3. High probability for residua - with the addition of Doppler vascular flow to the cavity.

The natural course of the ultrasonic appearance of the uterine cavity postpartum (14) was shown to take roughly 56 days for the cavity to appear empty in 95% percent of cases not suspected of having RPOC.

This study aims to test prospectively expectant management compared to misoprostol administration for a certain duration of time of cases with risk factors for RPOC, including cases undergoing revision of the uterine cavity or manual lysis of placenta postpartum, early postpartum hemorrhage, cases with a history of treated postpartum residua, having placental pathology (succenturiate, bilobed placenta), a pregnancy that started as multifetal with only one fetus reached advanced pregnancy, and patients undergoing Bumm curettage post-delivery.

2. Aims Since the literature data on this subject is scarce and the treatment is challenging, the primary aim of this study is to assess prospectively and randomly expectant management vs. misoprostol administration (PV, PO, SL) on the treatment for suspected RPOC postpartum in women with risk factors for residua along an 8-week duration as characterized by ultrasound follow-up every 2-3 weeks and divided to a 3 tier system of the low, medium and high probability of residua and the cases requiring hysteroscopy for suspected residua.

Secondary aims include side effects of treatment, late postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and endomyometritis / PID and complications.

3. Hypothesis In this study, we hypothesize that the treatment with misoprostol, compared to expectant management, will be able to reduce the number of cases at medium and high probability of residua as described by ultrasound and by that reduce the number of cases requiring hysteroscopy and treatment of residua.",RECRUITING,,2021-02-02,2025-06-30,2024-12-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,150,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Misoprostol 200mcg Tab"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Patients in the intervention group with suspected postpartum RPOC will receive 600 micrograms of misoprostol up to 3 times following delivery and followed up by ultrasound and clinical examinations for 6-12 weeks post-partum"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,misoprostol 200mcg tab,0

Their etiology can vary widely (spontaneous, iatrogenic, post-surgical perforation, anastomotic dehiscence, inflammatory process) and their treatment is complex, sometimes unresolved, and often requires a multidisciplinary approach. The chronicity of digestive and pelvic organ fistulas (e.g., vagino-vesical fistulas) is related to tissue repair mechanisms, which are delayed and subverted in favor of fibrotic and inflammatory processes. In these cases, the wound healing cascade stops at the inflammatory phase and does not result in the proliferation phase. The transition depends on changing levels of cytokines and growth factors. In the persistence of the inflammatory phase, polymorphonucleates and macrophages are active, phagocytosing and releasing enzymes that also damage healthy tissue. In this context, the anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, antiapoptotic, and tissue regenerative effects of adipose tissue-derived stromal or stem cells (ADSCs) could play a decisive role. In fact, ADSCs exhibit immunosuppressive properties on the proliferation of T cells, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells and modulate inflammation by implanting a regenerative niche with appropriate paracrine communication and subsequent tissue regeneration. ""Fat grafting"" has a wide range of application: it started with plastic surgery and regenerative medicine, then in orthopedics, maxillofacial surgery, and vascular surgery. Since 2019, a new procedure using processed fat grafting for the treatment of chronic fistulas of the gastrointestinal tract and pelvic organs has been initiated at the Agostino Gemelli IRCCS University Polyclinic Foundation and has become ""standard of care,"" with good results. The procedure is quick, safe, minimally invasive and cost-effective. Subcutaneous fat, immediately after harvesting from the same patient, is mechanically stimulated with oscillatory movements, then injected under endoscopic vision directly onto the orifice of the fistula.

People with hypochondriasis believe that real or imagined physical symptoms are signs of serious illnesses, despite medical reassurance and other evidence to the contrary. Symptoms of the disorder include a preoccupation with fear of an illness; a persistent fear of having a serious illness, despite medical reassurance; and misinterpretation of symptoms. Some individuals with hypochondriasis recognize that their fear of having a serious illness may be excessive, unreasonable, or unfounded. Episodes of hypochondriasis usually last from months to years, with equally long periods of remission. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the antidepressant drug fluoxetine (FLX) have both been shown to be effective treatments for hypochondriasis. However, the relative efficacy of a combined approach has yet to be determined. This study will compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medication, and a combination of the two for treating hypochondriasis.

Participants in this double-blind study will first report to the study site for two sessions to determine eligibility for participation. Eligible individuals will then be randomly assigned to receive one of the following four treatments for 12 weeks: CBT only; FLX only; CBT plus FLX; or a placebo pill.

Ipilimumab may allow immune cells to react to and destroy abnormal cells in the body, and has been tested in adults for a variety of cancers and has shown responses in some research studies. Because ipilimumab has not been tested in children, adolescents, or young adults, it is considered an experimental drug. The purposes of this research study are to determine the highest safe dose of ipilimumab for children, adolescents, and young adults with solid tumor cancers; examine its effectiveness and possible side effects; and better understand how the body and the immune system process it over time.

Candidates must be between 2 and 21 years of age and must have solid malignant tumors that have been resistant to standard therapy. Volunteers will be screened with a medical history, a clinical examination, and computerized scans such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants must have completed their last dose of chemotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, or antibody or investigational therapy at least four weeks prior to enrollment.

During the study, participants will receive an intravenous dose of ipilimumab once every three weeks. The infusion of ipilimumab will last 90 minutes, and the participant s vital signs will be monitored while the medicine is infusing and several times in the first 24 hours after the first dose (requiring a hospital stay during that time). If the participant is able to tolerate the first dose of ipilimumab, further doses (called cycles ) may be received on an outpatient basis. Blood and urine tests will be given on a regular basis during these cycles. After four cycles, participants whose tumors do not grow and who do not have unacceptable side effects will continue to receive ipilimumab every three months to maintain the current condition, until researchers conclude the study.","Background:

Solid tumors represent approximately one fourth of cancer diagnoses in children. Despite intensive regimens, patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors have unsatisfactory survival rates. Therefore new therapies are needed to improve outcomes.

Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of biologic approaches to heighten antitumor immunity in order to improve the effectiveness of immune based therapy. Both directly activating immune based therapies such as cytokines and tumor vaccines as well as therapies which disrupt negative counterregulatory signals such as those mediated by CTLA-4:B7 may enhance existent antitumor immune responses.

Antibodies directed against CTLA-4 potently augment immune responses in animal models and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor effects in a variety of preclinical tumor models.

Phase I and phase II studies using ipilimumab have been performed in adults with a variety of tumor types. Clinical responses have been observed in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer. No trials have yet been performed to evaluate ipilimumab in children with malignancy.

Objectives:

To determine the tolerance and toxicity profile of ipilimumab at a range of doses up to, but not exceeding, the highest dose tolerated in adults, in patients less than or equal to 21 years of age with refractory solid tumors.

To assess the pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab administered intravenously in patients less than or equal to 21 years of age with advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.

Eligibility:

Patients must be 1-21 years of age at the time of enrollment with solid malignant tumors refractory to standard therapy.

Design:

A Phase I dose finding study with 4 planned dose levels.

Three patients will be enrolled at each dose level with an expanded cohort of 12 at the highest or maximum torlerated dose with intent to include 6 patients \< 12 years.

Re-induction with 4 infusions of ipilimumab at the assigned dose followed by another maintenance phase is possible for subjects who have progressed during maintenance therapy.",COMPLETED,,2007-10-01,2015-11-13,2014-04-18,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,33,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Ipilimumab"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Dose Level Escalation: 1mg/kg, 3mg/kg, 5mg/kg, 10mg/kg"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,ipilimumab,1

The main outcomes were bowel functional outcomes and QoL. Bowel functional outcomes mainly included three indexes: stool frequency, urgency, incomplete defecation, and incontinence. The secondary outcomes were surgical outcomes including operative time, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative complications, reoperation, and mortality.","During the past two decades, remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of rectal cancer. The main goal of rectal surgery for malignancy is oncologic radicality in an effort to achieve the preservation of sphincters and sexual-urinary function.The introduction of circular stapling devices is largely responsible for their increasing popularity and utilization. Sphincter-saving procedures associated to partial or total mesorectal excision (TME) for the treatment of mid and distal rectal cancer have become increasingly prevalent as their safety and efficacy have been proved. Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the best available treatment for rectal cancer. With the advancement of surgical techniques, the majority of patients with mid and upper rectal cancer can undergo a sphincter-saving TME procedure. After TME, the most widely used reconstructive technique is straight coloanal anastomosis. With the advancement of surgical technique, the local recurrence rate after rectal cancer surgery has been decreased from 25-50% to 3-8%. Naturally, it is time to focus on how to improve bowel functional outcomes and quality of life (QoL) for rectal cancer patients. However, because the sigmoid colon is usually excised during surgery which decreases the storage volume of stool, there is a common problem seriously influencing the life quality of patients, including increased tool frequency, urgency and incontinence, which is termed as anterior resection syndrome (ARS). About 19-56% of patients would suffer from ARS. Thus, the demand for a technique with better functional outcomes made surgeons modify the straight anastomotic technique. Thus, another modified anastomotic technique, side-to-end anastomosis, which has been used since 1966, has gained attention. Side-to-end anastomosis usually needs a 3-5 cm-long colonic segment. Multiple studies on the literature have shown that compared with straight anastomosis, side-to-end anastomosis has advantages in bowel functional and operative outcomes.",RECRUITING,,2024-03-05,2025-03-20,2025-01-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,20,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Anterior resection of Rectal cancer"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""Anterior resection of cancer rectum and type of anastomosis (End to end or side to end)"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",PROCEDURE,anterior resection of rectal cancer,0

Reduced levels of NAPEs and NAEs have been found in obese individuals, and increasing plasma NAPE and NAEs levels may be beneficial to obese individuals trying to lose weight or to keep off weight gain after losing weight. We have found that oatmeal has large amounts of NAPEs, and based on previous mouse studies, we hypothesize that a single dose of dietary oatmeal is sufficient to double plasma NAE from baseline, possibly inducing satiety and increasing basal metabolic rate. To test this hypothesis, we will feed volunteers a single weight-based serving of oatmeal while monitoring its effects on serum glucose, NAPE and NAE levels as well as on subjective satiety.","N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPEs) and their active metabolites, N-acyl-ethanolamides (NAEs) are lipid satiety factors that are normally biosynthesized in the intestinal tract in response to food intake. Reduced levels of NAPEs and NAEs have been found in obese individuals, so that increasing plasma NAPE and NAEs levels may be beneficial to obese individuals trying to lose weight or to keep off weight gain after losing weight. While NAPEs are endogenously synthesized by mammals in their intestinal tract, many other organisms, including plants, also biosynthesize NAPEs. Recent screening of a wide range of foods by our lab demonstrated that oatmeal (Regular Instant Oatmeal) had very large amounts of NAPEs (0.17 mg NAPE / g dry oatmeal), suggesting that consumption of oatmeal may be a straightforward mechanism for elevating plasma NAPE and NAE levels in obese individuals. Based on our previous mouse studies with synthetic NAPE and with bacteria biosynthesizing NAPE, we hypothesize that a dose of oatmeal sufficient to deliver 0.135 mg NAPE per kg body should be sufficient to double plasma NAE levels from baseline, thereby inducing satiety and increasing basal metabolic rate. For a 100 kg person, 80 grams of dry regular instant oatmeal (2 servings) provides this 0.135 mg / kg dose. (The dose of dry oatmeal per person = (body weight in kg / 100 kg)\* 80 g dry oatmeal. Thus for 50 kg person, 40 g dry oatmeal (1 serving) provides the required dose.)

OTHER,NCT05102279,Analysis of Urine Composition Saturation and Dietary Intervention in Subjects Without Urinary Calculi,Analysis of Urine Composition Saturation and Dietary Intervention in Subjects Without Urinary Calculi,"Urinary calculi have become a global public health problem, which brings a huge economic burden to society and individuals. The pathogenesis of urinary calculi is not completely clear. Supersaturation of urinary components is a necessary condition for the formation of urinary calculi. The causes of stone formation are closely related to diet, drugs, metabolic disorders, basic diseases, genetic factors, environment and so on. Diet essentially determines the composition of urine, which affects the formation of urinary calculi. The effect of dietary phosphorus intake on stones is not clear. There is a lack of data to support dietary phosphorus as an influencing factor of stone formation. Phosphorus is present in most foods. 24h urine composition analysis is of great value in predicting the occurrence and composition of urinary calculi. However, due to the interaction between urine components, a single urine component can not well predict the occurrence of stones. Therefore, the researchers introduced the relative supersaturation of common stone components in urine to predict the incidence of stones. Therefore, we want to give healthy adults a diet with different phosphorus content for a period of time to clarify the effect of phosphorus in the diet on 24h urine composition level and urine relative supersaturation, so as to further explore the relationship between dietary phosphorus and the incidence of urinary calculi. To provide more clear recommendations for early prevention of urinary calculi, and provide more evidence for clinical decision-making, thereby reducing the incidence rate of urinary calculi.","\*Diet: Ordinary phosphorus diet: phosphorus content 1500mg High-phosphorus diet: Phosphorus content is 2500mg (inorganic phosphorus is added to the ordinary phosphorus diet) Low-phosphorus diet: Phosphorus content 500mg (The protein content and the ratio of plant protein and animal protein are consistent with the other two diets by adding egg protein and adding low-phosphorus whey protein powder.

A total of 104 patients with body mass index (BMI)≥30 kg/m² were enrolled to the study. In all participants, EFT was measured with transthoracic echocardiography at end-systole. The patients were then classified into two groups according to whether they had MetS or not. EFT, clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between the two groups","Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a kind of VAT, between the surface of the myocardium and the epicardium. It can easily be measured by standard two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. EAT serves as an endocrin organ that secretes hormones, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Previous data suggests that EAT can play an active role in the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Previous studies have investigated the relationship between EAT/inflammatory markers and MetS/MetS components. However, there was lack of enough evidence regarding this relationship in people with obesity with or without MetS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of echocardiographically measured EAT and inflammation, on the basis of c-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), as simple and reliable indicators of inflammation, with MetS and its components in people with obesity who have similar body mass index (BMI) values. In this cross-sectional study, 104 consecutive patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 who presented to the 'Obesity Solution Center 'of Antalya Research and Training Hospital were included .

The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from each subject.

Clinical information and current cardiovascular medication use were provided from each patient. Height, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference (HC) were measured when fasting and standing up with standard measuring tools. Patients were defined as having hypertension (HT) if their systolic blood pressure was \>140 mmHg, their diastolic blood pressure was \>90 mmHg, or they were using an antihypertensive medication.

Background:

* Parents and families of children with chronic illnesses have stressors, including financial stress, role strains, separations, and interruptions in daily routines and plans for the future. All of these experiences may lead directly and indirectly to parental stress.
* The number of families headed by single or lone parents is increasing. Little work has been done to better understand if the needs of parents who are providing care for a child on their own differ from parents who do not classify themselves as lone. Identifying parents who may need additional support within a pediatric oncology setting is very important so that appropriate support is provided.

Objectives:

- To better understand the social, emotional, and practical effects of lone parents on children with cancer.

Eligibility:

* All parents whose child has been diagnosed with cancer between 6 and 18 months before enrolling on the study.
* Participants must be able to speak and read English

Design:

* Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire during one of their child s clinic or hospital visits.
* The questionnaire will ask about the parenting experience since the child was diagnosed with cancer. It will ask about the support the parent has received from family and friends since the diagnosis.
* The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.","Background:

* Research examining the potential impact of childhood chronic illness on parents and families has delineated a myriad of stressors that parents may experience, including financial stress, role strains, separations, interruptions in daily routines and plans for the future, and general uncertainty regarding the child s prognosis.
* All of these possible experiences may lead directly and indirectly to anxiety, depression, posttraumatic-stress, hopelessness, and feelings of loss of control in parents and families.
* The number of families headed by single, or lone parents has increased significantly, with 3 in 10 children now living in single parent homes.
* It is not known whether distress is greater for parents who are lone parents.
* Lone-parent families earn on average only 55% of what married-parent families earn, and are four times more likely to live in poverty.
* It is unclear how lone parents trying to navigate the complex needs of maintaining a home, family, and a chronically ill child adapt to these challenges.
* It is also unclear how many parents who check single on a standardized forced choice questionnaire format consider themselves to be lone when it comes to the experience of caring for their child with cancer.

Objective:

\<TAB\>

* Aim 1: To define and characterize lone parents
* Aim 2: To describe perceptions of social support and how they relate to lone and non-lone parenting
* Aim 3: To identify distress outcomes in parents of children with cancer who identify themselves as being lone when it comes to the experience of caring for a child with cancer

Study Population:

English and Spanish speaking parents of a child (1through 17 years) with a malignancy, diagnosed 6-18 months before recruitment will be invited to participate in this study.

Recruitment of participants

One hundred participants from a combination of (a) local advertisements and/or (b) those whose details are held on a research database (of previous volunteers indicating willingness to be contacted about future studies) will be sought to volunteer for this study. Participants will be contacted via email/telephone/letter to provide information regarding this study. All volunteers interested in participating will be contacted to provide general information during a preliminary telephone screening interview. This will be used to check main inclusion and exclusion criteria. The women who fit these criteria will be sent the participant information sheet to read carefully and if still interested invited to attend the first laboratory visit for a screening session. Participants have greater than 48 hours to assess the participant information sheet before they attend this first visit when, if eligible, they will be asked to provide written informed consent.

Laboratory Visits

Visit 1

During this visit the study and all procedures will be explained in detail to all participants, and written informed consent will be taken. A thorough medical history will be obtained and participants will be asked to complete a Recruitment Information Questionnaire (RIQ) to confirm all inclusion/ exclusion criteria. Participants will complete the National Adult Reading Test (NART) which estimates premorbid intelligence levels.

Participants will also complete a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) which will be reviewed to determine whether participants are fit to continue with the study. Simple measures of body weight, height and waist circumference will be taken. Participants will complete a practice version of the cognitive test battery to demonstrate the tests, ensure participants understand how to perform the tests correctly and assess compliance (effort).

Participants will complete a cycling test on a stationary bicycle under the supervision of the investigator and a medic.

Visit 2

The second visit will involve several measures of arterial health which requires participants to attend in a 12 hour fasted state. Blood vessel function will be assessed using a blood pressure cuff around the lower arm for a period of 5 minutes. Cardiac structure and function will be assessed using two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. Vascular function will be assessed using ultrasound and applanation tonometry. All procedures are non-invasive. Percentages of body fat and muscle mass will be measured using bioimpedance.

A 60ml blood sample will be taken which will be used to asses endothelial progenitor cell number and function, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels and is part of the assessment for health of the arteries and vascular system.

Visit 3

On the third visit a cognitive function test will be completed, which requires participants to attend in a 12 hour fasted state.

Participants will perform a 45 minute battery of cognitive tests. Following the cognitive tests, participants will be asked to complete a cognitive test evaluation questionnaire to assess both subjective and objective cognition.

At the end of the third laboratory visit all participants will be provided with an ActiHeart accelerometer (Actigraph, Pensacola, USA) to wear for a period of one week in order to assess movement counts and sedentary behaviour. At the end of the seven days the accelerometer is given back to or collected by the team and the data downloaded.

The three baseline laboratory visits plus the seven days using the ActiHeart accelerometer all come under stage 1 of the study. Participants will be asked to continue into the exercise training stage (stage 2), and willing volunteers will move through to the second stage of the experiment. All measures will be repeated at 12 weeks (78 hours to 5 days following cessation of the last exercise training session).",COMPLETED,,2011-06,2014-06,2014-06,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,25,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Interval exercise training"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Interval exercise sessions (INT) involving work:recovery ratios of 40 s at 70% delta work-rate followed by 80 s active recovery at 20 W. 70% delta (∆) is 70% of the difference between work rate peak (WRpeak) and work rate at the lactate threshold (WRLT) calculated as:\n\n70%∆ =0.7(〖WR〗_peak- 〖WR〗_LT )+ 〖WR〗_LT\n\nWhere WR is work rate, LT is lactate threshold)\n\nEach session was for 30 min and this was undertaken twice per week for 12 weeks.

This study's main objective is to implement and evaluate neuroplasticity-inducing stimulation. The stimulation methods for inducing neuroplasticity have been selected based on prior preclinical and intraoperative work that has shown promise in providing rehabilitative benefits for stroke patients. We will be structuring this study as an open prospective feasibility study.","Stroke is one of the top three causes of human disability. In middle- and high-income countries around the world, stroke is the leading neurological cause of lost disability-adjusted life years. Motor deficits are among the most common results of stroke and contribute substantially to post-stroke disability. An estimated 6,600,000 American adults have had a symptomatic stroke, with a prevalence that increases with age. Each year, 795,000 people experience a stroke, of which 610,000 are first-ever symptomatic strokes. The mean survival after stroke is 6-7 years, with approximately 85% of patients living past the first year of stroke. With the decline in stroke mortality accompanying advances in acute stroke care and aging of the population, the disease burden is projected to increase. Thus, most patients survive their stroke and live with enduring disability for years to come.

Between 55% and 75% of patients have enduring motor deficits after stroke, which are associated with reduced quality of life, and 65% of patients at 6 months are unable to incorporate the affected hand effectively into daily activities. Subjective well-being is decreased one year after stroke, and some research attributes this decrease directly to arm motor impairments. In the long term after a stroke, at least half of patients have to rely on human assistance for basic activities of daily living (ADLs) such as feeding, self-care, and mobility. Upper extremity function is a key part of this disability after stroke. Needs assessments from patients include expectations of recovery, occupation-specific needs that may require strength vs fine motor skills, and activities of daily living, all of which will reduce overall disability measures. Upper extremity function (as measured by the Wolf Motor Function Test \[WMFT\]) has been shown as a predictor of quality-of-life scores.

Current therapies for a new stroke reduce disability in only a subset of patients. The only drug approved to treat acute ischemic stroke remains tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Only a minor fraction of patients receive this medicine in large part due to the narrow time window for safe drug administration. The fraction of patients who receive endovascular therapy is even smaller. Moreover, of those so treated, half or more have significant long-term disability.

Physical therapy remains the mainstay of treatment, and advances in remote teletherapy and other home or gaming options may further increase its utilization. Non-invasive exoskeleton use has also been approved for upper extremity therapy. These existing approaches to rehabilitation have been used for decades and are widely recognized to provide important benefits. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these rehabilitation approaches is equally widely recognized to be limited such that some patients do not respond to rehabilitation, and some only show partial recovery. These important limitations in the efficacy of existing rehabilitation approaches are likely due to the very nature of physical rehabilitation: they engage peripheral nerves and muscles and likely only have indirect effects on damaged physiology in the brain. It is equally expected that direct and targeted manipulation of brain physiology has the potential to rehabilitate people with chronic stroke more effectively. Thus, there has been a growing interest in using electric or magnetic stimulation of the cortex or cortical pathways to promote brain recovery and to enhance structural and functional brain plasticity.

The study proposes to investigate the effectiveness of promoting interactions between affected and intact cortical regions by inducing neural plasticity through specific protocols. By inducing plasticity through the use of closed-loop stimulation delivered simultaneously with conventional activity-based therapy, the study results are expected to enhance recovery beyond what is achievable with therapy alone.",RECRUITING,,2025-07-01,2030-06-15,2028-06-15,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,4,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""CorTec Brain Interchange (BIC) System"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Surgical implantation of the BIC System.

Approximately 15-25% of all breast cancers are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and it has been well known that HER2 overexpression is associated with more aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis with resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents.

Trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody, is the standard treatment for both early and metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In addition to other chemotherapeutic agents, trastuzumab significantly improves response rate and survival in HER2-positive early and metastatic breast cancer. Although it is well known that trastuzumab therapy is closely associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiotoxicity.

Addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy significantly improved response rate, time to disease progression and reduction of death compared to chemotherapy alone in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Thus, anti-HER2 treatment is a standard therapeutic approach for HER2-positive MBC patients with visceral crisis. Trastuzumab administration as an adjuvant and in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer is associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiotoxicity. The incidence of trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity were 27% with antracycline combination and 13% when it was administered with paclitaxel .

Pertuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 dimerization domain, prevents dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors (HER3,HER1, and HER4) especially with HER3. Pertuzumab differs from trastuzumab in the epitope binding regions of the light chain; pertuzumab binds to domain 2 ofHER2 essential for dimerization, whereas trastuzumab binds to domain 4 of HER2. Blocking HER2-HER3 dimerization is postulated to be the most clinically relevant action of pertuzumab and this can effectively block her2-mediated cell signaling.

Pertuzumab is indicated in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

The randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,phase III CLEOPATRA (the CLinical Evaluation OfPertuzumab And Trastuzumab) study involved 808 patients with HER2-positive MBC who had not received prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy, who were randomized to placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel or pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel as first line treatment until disease progression. No additional cardiotoxicity was observed when adding pertuzumab compared to placebo. The incidence of any cardiac disorder as assessed by the investigators was similar in the placebo (16.4%) and pertuzumab (14.5%) arms. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) was observed in 8.3% and 4.4% of placebo and pertuzumab patients, respectively. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction of grade III or higher was reported in 7 (1.8%) patients in the placebo arm and 4 (1.0%) in the pertuzumab arm.

Objectives.The aim of this study was to assess the effect on small airways obstruction of long-term treatments with two different LABA+ICS combinations in asthma.

Patients and methods.Ten subjects with moderate persistent asthma were enrolled. After a 4-week washout they were treated in a randomized cross-over design for 24 weeks with formoterol 12 mcg and beclometasone 200 mcg HFA (by MDI) b.i.d. (FB) or salmeterol 50 mcg and fluticasone 250 mcg (diskus) b.i.d. (SF). At baseline and at the end of each period subjects underwent Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Pulmonary Function Testing. The N2 phase III slope and closing volume (CV) during single breath washout test, and DElta(Heliox-air)MEF50% were measured to assess changes on peripheral airways function.","Study design After a 4-week washout period, during which patients were allowed to take only salbutamol (as needed), they were assigned according to a double-blind, double-dummy randomized crossover study to one of the two following 24-week treatments: 1) formoterol 12 µg plus beclomethasone HFA 200 µg (by MDI) b.i.d., or 2) salmeterol 50 µg plus fluticasone propionate 250 µg (diskus) b.i.d.. Daily doses of 400 µg beclomethasone HFA and 500 µg of fluticasone propionate are equivalent, according to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) International guidelines6. At the end of first period and after another 4-week washout period, they received the second randomized 24-week treatment.

Adherence to the treatment was based on self-reports by each patient, on a declaration of willingness to continue to participate to the study and on the counter of drug doses disposed by inhalers. All patients have been trained to correctly inhale the drugs by different devices.

At the end of the washout periods and two treatments the subjects underwent Asthma Control Test (ACT), oxygen saturation (SaO2) measurement and Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT).

The subjects were enrolled after obtainment of written consent. The protocol has been approved by our local Ethic Committee.

Asthma Control Test Subjects completed an ACT questionnaire at the end of each washout and treatment period. Asthma control was assessed by the validated Italian version of the ACT. They subjectively evaluated the degree of impairment caused by their asthma during the preceding 4 weeks answering to five questions using a five-point-scale. The ACT is a reliable and validated tool, responsive to changes in asthma control over time. A cut-off score of 19 or less identifies subjects with poorly controlled asthma.

Pulmonary Function Testing A computerized water-sealed light-bell Stead-Wells spirometer (Biomedin, Padua, Italy) was used for measuring slow vital capacity (SVC), inspiratory capacity (IC), and maximal flow-volume curves. The operator was assisted during the test by software able to verify electronically both the acceptability and reproducibility of spirometric maneuvers. All the spirometric tests employed in the study fulfilled the recommendations of American Thoracic Society. Total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV) were obtained by using the plethysmographic method. The body plethysmograph was a variable flow, constant pressure-type with a frequency response flat until 30 Hz (Biomedin, Padua, Italy).

Determination of the slope of N2 phase III and closing volume (CV) was obtained during a single-breath nitrogen washout test (SBWN2)(Medical Graphics, St. Paul, MN, US). Subjects in sitting position after exhaling to residual volume (RV) inhaled slowly pure oxygen with a single breath until TLC and then expired slowly from TLC to RV. The expired nitrogen concentration was measured and plotted as function of expired lung volume. This relationship was fitted linearly in the phase III and the slope of N2 phase III was computed automatically by the software. The onset of phase IV was identified on the trace by software or by visual examination, if required. The average values of the N2 phase III slope and CV obtained from two acceptable and reproducible measurements (with expiratory slow vital capacity within 10%) were selected for analysis.

Expiratory maximal flow-volume curves breathing either air or heliox (oxygen 21% and helium 79%) were also performed. Breathing mixture was introduced in the bell of spirometer by a 3-way stopcock connected to the ambient air or to a cylinder containing humidified heliox at ambient temperature and pressure. In each occasion, after 3 slow deep breaths to total lung capacity, a forced expiratory maneuver was performed starting from TLC without end-inspiratory pause. Measurements of MEF50% with air and heliox and determination of their differences \[Delta(Heliox-air)MEF50%\] were obtained at baseline and subsequently at corresponding isovolume.

Statistical analysis All values are expressed as mean ± SD. We used the mean of the functional values of the two baselines for comparisons. Analysis of variance of the variables of interest among baseline and two therapeutic regimens (end of treatment periods) were performed by Friedman's test. Comparisons between groups were made according to Wilcoxon test, when allowed. A p value \<0.05 was considered significant.

The induction of general anesthesia leads to a state of reduced responsiveness, which is often described by anesthesiologists and patients as ""sleep"". This seems to be a common problem in the case of patients under general anesthesia, besides surgery trauma and general anesthetics may change sleep function and sleep cycle perioperatively, the postoperative complications such as pain, nausea and vomiting etc after general anesthesia may also reduce postoperative sleep quality.Flurbiprofen axetil is a new non-steroidal anti infection analgesic(NSAIDs), which is widely used for analgesia to reduce the dose of opioids and the occurrence of adverse reactions, such as declined sleep quality, respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting . Preemptive analgesia is an analgesic intervention that begins before surgery to prevent the nervous system from becoming sensitive to subsequent stimuli that may aggravate pain. A large number of experimental studies have shown that use flurbiprofen axetil preoperatively is better than use it postoperatively. However, limited information was reported before on the effect of factors such as age, gender, preoperative negative mood such as anxiety and depression, type and length of surgery, which could influence postoperative pain and analgesic consumption and the association between postoperative sleep quality and postoperative pain intensity. At present, there has been less previous evidence for how preemptive analgesic with flurbiprofen axetil affect postoperative sleep quality through its effect on postoperative pain of patients with different sex under general anesthesia.",,UNKNOWN,,2021-01-01,2021-11-30,2021-10-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,100,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""preemptive analgesia with flurbiprofen axetil"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""give flurbiprofen axetil 15 min before surgery"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,preemptive analgesia with flurbiprofen axetil,0

Actually about 80% of patients showing an ST segment elevation after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) have a coronary lesion documented by coronary angiography. In those patients, early coronary angiography has been shown to improve survival with good neurologic outcome. More controversial is the scene for patients without an ST segment elevation. Even in the absence of ST segment elevation an acute coronary syndrome can be at the basis of cardiac arrest. However, the prognostic role of early coronary angiography in such patients is still a matter of debate. In 2014 a consensus document by the European Association for Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) recommended elevation to consider early coronary angiography only in the case of hemodynamic instability or of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias for patients without ST segment as in the case of NSTEMI patients without cardiac arrest. At the light of these considerations the correct diagnosis of ST segment elevation is of pivotal importance for the right treatment in the right time and in the right hospital for this type of patients. Moreover, during cardiac arrest and during resuscitation the heart is suffering of ischemia deriving both from a coronary occlusion if present and from low systemic perfusion. Post-ROSC ECG could reflect both these types of ischemia, so the ST elevation could be not specific for a coronary occlusion. However, some time after ROSC, in case of absence of a coronary occlusion, the heart perfusion should improve, the ischemia should decrease and the ST segment elevation should regress. Nevertheless, current guidelines do not provide any indication about the best timing for ECG acquisition after ROSC. We believe that address this issue could be important in order to correctly discriminate the appropriate candidate for emergency coronary angiography in the post-ROSC phase of a cardiac arrest.

A preliminary analysis performed on a population of patients suffering an OHCA in the Province of Pavia supported this hypothesis. It was pointed out that early detection of ST segment elevation, within ten minutes from ROSC, was associated to a high number of false positives that is to say patients without an identifiable coronary culprit lesion. ST segment elevation was found to be an independent predictor of coronary angioplasty only if detected after ten minutes from ROSC.

The PEACE study aimed to confirm our preliminary results on a larger and multicentric sample of post ROSC patients.",COMPLETED,,2015-01-01,2019-12-31,2018-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,1000,ESTIMATED,[],,,1

OTHER,NCT03708679,Effects of Menstrual Cycle on Preoperative Anxiety,"Are Menstruel Cycle Phases Effective on Preoperative Anxiety? Prospective, Clinical Study",The investigators aimed to investigate the effect of menstrual cycle phases on preoperative anxiety in women under general anesthesia.,"In preoperative period, preoperative anxiety is experienced in different degrees due to surgery and anesthesia. Preoperative anxiety is a condition that negatively affects anesthesia, surgery and postoperative recovery. It is reported that the incidence of preoperative anxiety in the western population is between 60% and 80%. In the pre-operative period, there are many causes of anxiety related to the patient's health and the concerns about the operation, uncertainty of the outcome, non-wake up after surgery, pain hearing and waking during surgery. It has been reported that anxiety increases direct blood pressure and changes pulse rate. It is stated that anxiety also affects the awakening criteria in postoperative period. This may cause hemodynamic instability in anesthesia applications.

Hormonal, physical and psychological fluctuations occur in women due to menstrual cycle. Therefore, it is reported that there is a strong relationship between the menstrual cycle and the person's emotional state. It is known that women feel good in the first phase of the cycle and they experience emotional, physical and behavioral disorders towards the end of the cycle. Studies have shown that anesthetic requirements, postoperative analgesic requirement and incidence of nausea vomiting may change with the phases of the cycle. Similarly, in the luteal phase of the cycle, it has been suggested that luteinizing hormones cause sensitization in opioid receptors and increase sensitivity to pain. In addition, depressive symptoms increase before menstruation. In this process, some women may have pre-menstrual dysphoric discomfort, irritability, mood swings, depression, flare, anger, restlessness, anorexia, sleep disturbance, and fatigue.

Our hypothesis is that preop anxiety will be higher in the surgeries planned in the luteal phase.

We aimed to investigate the effect of menstrual cycle phases on preoperative anxiety in women under general anesthesia.

Material Method Ethics Committee approval was obtained before the study. After the written consent of the patients were obtained, they started to the study. The study was planned as a randomized prospective study between February 2018 and February 2019.

The study groups were selected from patients who presented to the preop anesthesia polyclinic in elective conditions, septo-rinoplasty operation under general anesthesia. Assuming that there would be a 5-point difference in anxiety scores among the groups, it was decided to take 40 cases for each group with a 0.75 standard effect size, 80% power, and 5% error. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups of 40 patients. The patients were randomized by sequential addition to the groups determined in the order of their inclusion.

Study inclusion criteria: The study included 80 women with ASA I-II, aged 18 to 45 years, who were accepted to participate in the study, were smoking, did not use oral contraceptives, had no menstrual irregularity (regular 28 ± 2 days menstrual cycle).

Study exclusion criteria: In preop evaluation patients had difficulties in communication, amenorrhea, pregnancy, delirium, psychological illness, major depressive disorder, patients with a history of acute illness (such as in intensive care unit follow-up), which may affect cognitive function and daily life activities in the last 6 months, malignancy, acute renal failure, substance abuse and patients older than 45 years and male sex will be excluded from the study.

Groups:

Information about menstrual cycle patterns was obtained from all cases. The days of the menstrual cycle will be determined starting from counting the first day of the last cycle. Patients with menstrual cycle between 8-12 days were called Group F (Follicular phase). Patients with menstrual cycle between 20-24 were called Group L (Luteal phase). The follow-up of the cases and the recording of the measurements were performed by an anesthesiologist who did not know which group the cases were in.

Procedure to be Applied:

The sex, age, height and ASA scores of the patients were recorded preoperatively. The STAI instantaneous anxiety inventory, which measures situational anxiety in the preop unit, will be completed. In this form, there are 20 expressions, each is scored between the values of 1 to 4.

The total STAI score will be determined by subtracting the sum of the scores given to the expressions expressing positive emotions (1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19 and 20) from the sum of the scores given to the expressions expressing negative emotions (3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17 ve 18), then constant 50 number will be added to this value.

In preop unit and operation room, hemodynamic parameters (systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation values preop at 15th, 10th, 5th, before induction, after induction at 1th and intubation at 1st, 5th and 15th minutes will be recorded.

This study will test the effect of a psycho educational intervention on psychological and physical outcomes in the first 12 months after ICD implantation. Primary outcome measures are anxiety, depression, and functional status. The effect of the intervention on variables that mediate adaptation and outcomes (symptoms, illness appraisal, and coping behaviors) will also be examined. Secondary aims will examine subsequent arrhythmia events (ICD delivered therapy) and health resource utilization in relation to the main outcomes. The intervention and study variables are based on stress and coping theory and previous research with ICD patients, which documented negative outcomes of ineffective coping and compelling relationships between increased emotional distress and subsequent arrhythmia events.

A three-group, randomized, clinical trial with a repeated-measures design will be used. ICD patients (n=240) will be randomized to receive either the usual standard of care, symptom management training plus cognitive behavioral intervention delivered in a group format, or symptom management training plus cognitive behavioral intervention delivered by nurse provided telephone counseling. The symptom management-training component will be provided in the acute care setting and will focus on symptoms of pain, sleep disturbances and ICD shocks. The four cognitive behavioral sessions by group or telephone format will begin 6-8 weeks after hospitalization and will focus on illness reappraisal and coping skill training.

However, precise clinical prediction tools for selecting optimal treatment strategies are lacking. This study aims to develop an automated treatment clustering system using artificial intelligence to classify patients based on etiology into (i) anatomical factors, (ii) reduced muscle responsiveness, and (iii) other non-anatomical factors.

Cross-validation will be conducted on new OSA patients undergoing various management strategies, including surgical intervention, CPAP therapy, and oropharyngeal training (delivered face-to-face or via telerehabilitation). This system aims to enhance clinicians' ability to predict treatment success rates and improve patient outcomes.","Backgrounds:

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is marked by repeated upper airway obstructions during sleep, affecting about 14% of men and 5% of women aged 30-70 years. The etiology of OSA is divided into anatomical and non-anatomical factors. Anatomical factors include upper airway narrowing or collapse, while non-anatomical factors encompass reduced muscle responsiveness, low arousal threshold, and high loop gain. Anatomical issues can be managed using surgical interventions or dental appliances. Non-anatomical issues like low arousal threshold and high loop gain may require pharmacological treatment or oxygen therapy. The genioglossus (GG) muscle's activity, crucial during sleep, is insufficient in about 30% of OSA patients. Regular oropharyngeal muscle exercises can reduce OSA severity and related symptoms.

However, precise clinical prediction tools for selecting optimal treatment strategies are lacking, and research on telerehabilitation for OSA patients is insufficient. This study aims to develop an automated treatment clustering system using artificial intelligence to classify patients based on etiology into: (i) anatomical factors, (ii) reduced muscle responsiveness, and (iii) other non-anatomical factors. This system will analyze physiological sleep assessments from a retrospective polysomnography (PSG) database. Cross-validation will be conducted on new OSA patients undergoing various management strategies, including surgical intervention, CPAP therapy, and oropharyngeal training (delivered face-to-face or via telerehabilitation).

Methods:

The automated treatment clustering system employs artificial intelligence to classify patients into etiological groups: (i) anatomical factors like upper airway narrowing or collapse; (ii) non-anatomical factors such as reduced muscle responsiveness; and (iii) other non-anatomical factors. The classification relies on analyzing multiple physiological sleep assessments, including electromyography (EMG) and pneumotachographs, from a retrospective PSG database. The system will undergo cross-validation with novel OSA patients, who will be screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and provide consent.

During the cross-validation phase, the OSA patients will undergo various assessments, including polysomnography, sleep-related questionnaire, drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE), computed tomography (CT) scans, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), tongue muscle strength and endurance tests, and mental state evaluations. Pre- and post-treatment measurements will be conducted. CT scans and DISE will assess anatomical structures before and after treatment, while fMRI will examine brain activation status. Muscle strength and endurance tests will evaluate the responsiveness level of tongue muscle before and after intervention.

The automated treatment clustering system, utilizing machine learning, will determine the phenotype of each case based on PSG, CT, sleep endoscopy, fMRI, and tongue strength and endurance results. These results will aid clinicians in categorizing patients and predicting treatment success rates. Treatment decisions will involve collaboration between physicians and patients, considering clinical expertise and patient preferences.

Participants classified as upper airway narrowing or collapse due to anatomical factors by the phenotyping system will be recommended for surgical management. For patients with reduced muscle responsiveness, a 12-week program of oropharyngeal muscle training is recommended. This training will be administered in two modes: face-to-face sessions and telerehabilitation. Each session will last 45-60 minutes, with participants attending face-to-face sessions in the lab or online classes (telerehabilitation) 1-3 days per week. Both groups will be instructed to perform additional oropharyngeal exercises at home. Patients not fitting these groups will use CPAP therapy, the gold standard for OSA management. During the treatment period, participants from all groups will have regular follow-ups to assess potential risks. Each group is expected to include 50 cases. After six months of treatment, the apnea-hypopnea index will be collected based on polysomnography to evaluate the success rates, comparing them to the predicted value analyzed using the phenotyping system.",RECRUITING,,2024-07-30,2026-05-01,2026-01-31,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,OTHER,150,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Control Group"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""sleep hygiene education"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Surgical Intervention"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""Surgical Intervention includes uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) and transoral robotic surgery (TORS).

Our specific aims are:

1. To perform an RCT in which 100 schizophrenia subjects are assigned to either 60 hours of neuroplasticity- based computerized targeted cognitive training (TCT) that focuses exclusively on ""cold cognition"" (a program which trains early sensory processing, attention, working memory and cognitive control in auditory and visual domains), or to 60 hours of training that combines the TCT program with 20 minutes per day of adaptive computerized social cognition training (SCT) exercises.
2. To compare the outcomes of these two groups of subjects on measures of neurocognition, social cognition, motivation, and functional outcome.
3. To assess subjects six months after the intervention to determine the durability of training effects.
4. To identify changes in brain activation patterns in key neural regions as a result of TCT alone vs. TCT+SCT: during reward anticipation, and during emotion recognition.

The timeliness of this approach is supported by recent evidence demonstrating only weak associations between traditional cognitive remediation approaches and functional outcome in schizophrenia, but a strong, direct relationship between social cognition and functional outcome.

OTHER,NCT02508779,BGAT (Blood Glucose Awareness Training) for Users Who Might Become Pregnant,Blood Glucose Training for Women With Type 1 Diabetes Contemplating Pregnancy,"Ineffective management of blood glucose (BG) levels during preconception and pregnancy has been associated with severe maternal and fetal complications in women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Preconception care emphasizing stringent glycemic control in the preconception period and continued through early pregnancy can dramatically reduce these risks. However, the use of preconception care in the US has been disappointingly low due to a variety of organizational, provider, and patient centered factors. Furthermore, efforts to achieve tight glycemic control can increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH) in T1DM women, potentially leading to serious health consequences. In this project, the investigators will test an education based Internet intervention (Bump2be or Blood glucose awareness training (BGAT) for users who might become pregnant) for use with T1DM women who are either actively trying to become pregnant (TP) or planning to become pregnant in the 12 months following their enrollment in this study (PP).

The main objective is to examine Bump2be's feasibility and preliminary efficacy as an intervention for these women to better regulate their BG levels and to meet their diabetes-related clinical targets for pregnancy. More specifically, Bump2be will be tested in a randomized clinical trial in which 58 T1DM women who are either TP or PP will be recruited. As part of this pre-post study design, participants will be randomly assigned to either the Bump2be intervention (n=29) or the routine care group (n=29). Data collected will include frequency of extreme BG, consequences of extreme BG, average BG levels (HbA1c level), estimation of BG, detection of low and high BG, and psychological functioning (including fear of hypoglycemia, avoidance of hyperglycemia, well-being, and internal locus of control). Interviews with up to 10 trial participants will be conducted at the conclusion of their study participation, to enable further optimization of the intervention in preparation for a subsequent R01 submission. This will be the first study investigating the use of the Internet to improve detection and management of extreme BG levels in Diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) women who are either TP or PP.","Scientific Background: The number of women with type 1 diabetes is expected to rise, particularly for those in their early reproductive years. Pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy can increase the risk of various maternal (e.g., hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis) and fetal complications. Uncontrolled BG levels immediately before and during pregnancy have been associated with miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, infant mortality and a twofold to fourfold increased risk of major congenital malformations. Maternal hyperglycemia has been shown to complicate pregnancy more than any other factor and has been associated with a higher rate of spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations. Preconception care emphasizing stringent BG control in the preconception period (at least three to six months prior to pregnancy) and continued throughout can significantly reduce these risks to levels that are similar to those reported for the non-diabetic population. These attempts to achieve tighter BG control have, however, been linked to increased incidence of SH in early pregnancy. These findings point to the critical importance of providing TIDM women with practical self-management skills that they can actively use to better manage their BG levels, and achieve their target glycemic control without undue risk of hypoglycemia in preparation for pregnancy. At present, however, there are no published behavioral interventions specifically tailored to improving detection and management of extreme BG levels in this patient population.

Rationale: The overall aim of this research is to develop (Phase 1) and test (Phase 2) the feasibility of the Bump2be Internet intervention for use with Diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) women who are either TP or PP to help them effectively detect and reduce occurrences of extreme BG levels. Phase 1 of this research was submitted and approved by the Institutional Review Board (HSR# 16668) in 2013 and has been completed. The Bump2be intervention is based on BGATHome (Blood Glucose Awareness Training at Home), which is an automated, tailored, Internet delivered, psycho-educational intervention for T1DM patients. BGATHome is based on theories of self-regulation of health behavior, and the training focuses on patients' learning how to use both internal cues (e.g., physical and mood changes) and external cues (e.g., insulin and food action) to improve their BG awareness. It has proven successful in improving patients' glycemic control as well as their abilities to detect, anticipate, avoid, and treat extremes BG levels. Investigators have historically excluded T1DM women who were either pregnant or planning pregnancy from BGAT-related studies given their unique clinical needs and glycemic targets. The investigators now propose to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Bump2be in women with T1DM who are either TP or PP to help them better regulate their BG levels and to meet the diabetes-related clinical targets for and during pregnancy. This protocol covers Phase 2 of this project.

Relevance: There is an urgent need to effectively support Diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) women who are either TP or PP in their efforts to achieve and maintain strict glycemic control without experiencing SH. The investigators propose to test an Internet-based training program (Bump2be.org) to assist these women better anticipate, detect, manage, and prevent extreme BG occurrences to enable them to meet their glycemic goals for pregnancy. If found efficacious, Bump2be will be the first Internet-based behavioral intervention to train and assist these women achieve the recommended glycemic targets without increasing their risk of SH. The program has the potential to impact its target patients on a major public health level by supplementing their preconception care with a conveniently accessible program tailored to their specific needs. It holds promise to improve not only their BG management but also psychosocial functioning (e.g., reduced fear of hypoglycemia, improved diabetes-related quality of life and knowledge) with no additional burden on the healthcare system.",COMPLETED,,2015-07,2016-10,2016-09,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,54,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Bump2be"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Bump2be is an internet intervention focusing on six topics (called cores) psycho-educational in nature with the goals of improving individuals' ability to: a) anticipate extreme BG levels, b) detect the presence of extreme BG levels, c) address current extreme BG levels, and d) prevent future extreme BG levels.

OTHER,NCT01763879,Pressure-controlled vs Volume Controlled Ventilation on RV Function During OLV,Right Ventricular Function During One-lung Ventilation: The Effects of Pressure Controlled and Volume Controlled Ventilation,"The use of pressure controlled ventilation (TV) during one lung ventilation (OLV) for thoracic surgery is associated with comparable oxygenation with volume controlled ventilation (VCV) with added benefits of decreasing airway pressures and shunt fraction. The later may improve the right ventricular (RV) function during OLV. We postulate that the use of PCV during OLV for thoracic surgery would preserve RV function than during VCV. After local ethics committee approval and informed consent, we will randomly allocate 28 patients scheduled for elective thoracic surgery OLV to randomly crossed from PCV to VCV mode (n= 14 for each) during with VT of 6 mL/kg, I: E ratio 1: 2.5, PEEP of 5 cm H2O, recruitment maneuvers and respiratory rate will be adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Intraoperative changes in the right ventricular function (peak systolic and diastolic tricuspid annular velocity (TAV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and RV fractional area changes (RV-FAC)), hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters, peak and plateau airway pressures, compliance will be recorded.","One-lung ventilation (OLV) provides excellent operative field for thoracic procedures, but is opposed by the harmful impairment of cardiac index and right ventricular (RV) function which may influence postoperative morbidity and mortality. In our previous study, we demonstrated significant reductions in RV ejection fraction (REF) and CI values after the initiation of OLV attributable to the increased right ventricular afterload, stroke work and end-diastolic volume augmented by increased airway pressures. This may be harmful with the patients with advanced obstructive lung diseases and those with pulmonary hypertension. Thus there is no doubt that decreases in airway pressures will be associated with better RV function.

Volume controlled ventilation (VCV) is the commonly used traditional ventilation mode for OLV during thoracic procedures but its use is associated with deleterious increases in airway pressure which may impede RV function.

Pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) is an alternative mode of ventilation which is widely used in the patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI), whereby high initial flow rates are delivered to quickly achieve and maintain the set inspiratory pressure followed by rapidly decelerating flow.These high initial flow rates lead to a more rapid alveolar inflation.

PCV has been suggested as a useful tool to improve oxygenation as well as decreases in intra-pulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) and airway pressures compared with VCV during OLV for patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Whereas, others demonstrated comparable arterial oxygenation with the use of PCV and VCV during OLV.

However, the use of PCV offers advantages over VCV during OLV in the term of reducing mean and bronchial peak airway pressures and intrapulmonary shunt, hence limiting the risk for barotrauma and impaired RV function.

Up to the investigators knowledge, there is no available study of the effects of PCV and VCV on RV function during OLV after thoracic surgery.

The investigators hypothesize that the use of PCV during OLV will be associated with preserved RV function than during the use of VCV. They will compare the effects of the use of PCV and VCV with 5 cm H2O level of PEEP and recruitment maneuvers during OLV on the right ventricular function (peak systolic and diastolic tricuspid annular velocity (TAV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and RV fractional area changes (RV-FAC)), hemodynamic parameters (heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure, (MAP)), oxygenation parameters (arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension (PaO2 and PaCO2, respectively), and arterial tension to inspired fraction of oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio), ventilation parameters (peak and plateau airway pressures (Ppk and Ppl, respectively) and compliance) and the ICU and hospital length-of-stays, morbidity and 30-day mortality.

Sample size calculation:

A priori power analysis of the previous published data11 showed that the investigators will need to study 13 pairs to detect a 20% difference in the mean maximal systolic TAV values (7.0 cm/s) with a SD of 1.4 cm/s, after start of OLV, a type-I error of 0.05 and a power of 90%. We will add 10% more patients for a final sample size of 28 patients to account for patients dropping out during the study.

Interventions:

In all patients, standard monitors will be applied. A thoracic epidural or paravertebral catheter will be inserted with no more use of local anesthetics during the study to avoid their effects on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.12 An arterial line (20 G) and a right internal jugular vein catheter will be inserted. Anesthetic technique will be standardized in all studied patients. Anesthesiologists who will give the anaesthetic will be not involved in the patient's assessment. General anesthesia will be induced with propofol (2-3 mg/kg), fentanyl (2-3 µg/kg), and cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) will be given to facilitate tracheal intubation with a left-sided double-lumen tube (DLT). The correct position of its tip will be confirmed with a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Anesthesia will be maintained with 1-1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane and increments of fentanyl (0.5µg/kg) and cisatracurium (0.04 mg/kg).

The patients' lungs will be mechanically ventilated using VCV mode, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 in air, tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL/kg (predicted body weight), inspiratory to expiratory \[I: E\] ratio of 1:2.5, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, respiratory rate (R.R) will be adjusted to achieve an PaCO2 of 35-45 mm Hg, peak inspiratory pressures (Ppk) will be limited to 35 cm H2O and a low fresh gas flow (FGF) (\<2 L/min) in a semi closed circuit system.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) will be inserted and the right ventricular function will be assessed with the measurements of EDV, ESV, RVEF, both maximal systolic and diastolic TAV at the tricuspid annulus at the RV free wall recorded from the apical 4-chamber views using pulsed wave Doppler tissue imaging.

All operations will be performed by the same surgeons. Intraoperative hypoxemia will be defined as decrease in arterial oxygen saturation less than 90% will be treated with increasing of FiO2 to 1.0. Addition of low level of 2 cm H2O of CPAP will be considered if the later fails to correct hypoxemia. 1 Intraoperative fluid therapy will include intravenous infusion of 2 ml/kg/hour of Lactated Ringer's solution and blood losses will be compensated with colloids and with red blood cell concentrates if the hemoglobin levels decreases below 8 to 9 g/dL. Mean arterial blood pressure will be maintained greater than 60 mm Hg using bolus doses of ephedrine 5 mg or phenylephrine 100 ug. Urine output will be maintained to be greater than 0.5 ml/kg/hour.

At the end of surgery, the nondependent will be re-expanded and TLV will be resumed as before surgery, sevoflurane will be discontinued, the residual neuromuscular block will be antagonized, and the patient will be extubated. Postoperative analgesia will be accomplished with the use of continuous epidural/paravertebral infusion of bupivacaine 0.125% and fentanyl 2 µg/mL.

Statistical Analysis:

Data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Fisher exact test will be used for categorical data. Repeated two-way ANOVA and paired t-test will be used to study the changes in the primary and secondary endpoints during each intervention. The Wilcoxon 2 rank sum test will be used for the non-parametric values. We will avoid the carryover effect (persistence of the effect of the first intervention on the operative conditions into the second period) through the comparison of the effects of period (time effect) and the order of treatment using independent t-tests. Data will be expressed as mean ± SD, number (%), or median \[range\].

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of various doses of STP705 administered as an Intralesional injection in subjects with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in situ skin cancer (isSCC). This study seeks to establish a safe and effective recommended dose of STP705 for the treatment of isSCC. Expression of biomarkers common to the isSCC formation pathway, including TGF-β1 and COX-2, will be evaluated.

The primary endpoint will be the proportion of participants with histological clearance of treated isSCC lesion at the End of Treatment (EOT). Histological clearance (HC) will be defined as the absence of detectable evidence of isSCC tumor cell nests as determined by central pathology review.

Secondary endpoints will include i) time to histological clearance of treated isSCC lesion over the 6 week treatment period, ii) proportion of participants with complete clinical clearance of treated isSCC lesion based on investigator assessment at the End of Treatment (EOT), iii) time to complete clinical clearance of treated isSCC lesion based on investigator assessment over the 6 week treatment period, and iv) the change in size of the treated isSCC lesion over the 6 week treatment period.

Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the number of incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); the incidence of AEs and SAEs leading to discontinuation of trial medication; the incidence and severity of Local Skin Response (LSR); hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation following treatment; and the tolerability of repeated Intralesional administration of STP705 as assessed by investigator-evaluation of injection site reactions for all patients and within each cohort.

The size, shape, and symmetry of the breasts can have a dramatic effect on the women's wellbeing. Reduction mammaplasty is certainly one of the operations; plastic surgeons can significantly contribute to a woman's quality of life.

Macromastia or Breast Hypertrophy is a pathologic condition consisting of hypertrophy of the breast. It generates both physical and psychological distress, presenting a significant threat to a woman's health-related quality of life. Regarding Physical Distress Macromastia always associated with a number of musculoskeletal complications, including neck pain, back pain, headache, peripheral neuralgias, and shoulder pain. Often, women with mammary hypertrophy experience intertriginous skin maceration and other rashes, as well as infections all the result of heavy, pendulous breasts. In short, a woman's breast size can affect her attitudes, career choices, and personal life in many ways.

Ideal technique should end in a beautiful breast, which has good size with fullness in the upper part, attractive shape with adequate projection, elegant curves, and a nipple areola complex that is pleasing in shape and position. The result should last over years.

The inferior pedicle technique has been described with many variations by surgeons such as Ribeiro and Robbins with the nipple and areola being carried on a dermal pedicle, and it is probably one of the most popular breast reduction techniques currently in use in the United States. Advantages of this are well known. It is a rapid and safe technique that can be used on almost every breast size. It has been shown to be as good as or better than other techniques in the preservation of the neurovascular supply to the nipple. It is easily taught and learned.

The superomedial pedicle technique was first described by Orlando \& Gutherie as a modification of the superior pedicle technique.

The safety of this drug will also be studied.,"The Study Drug:

Ruxolitinib is designed to block the protein product of a mutated (changed) gene that may be important in cancer cell growth and survival.

Study Drug Administration:

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, every day of each 28-day cycle you will take ruxolitinib by mouth 2 times a day (in the morning and evening).

On Day 1 of each cycle, the morning dose of study drug should not be taken until you visit the clinic unless the doctor says differently.

If the doctor thinks it is necessary, your dose of study drug may be raised or lowered.

Study Visits:

On Day 1 of Cycle 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will be asked to list any drugs you may be taking and if you have experienced any side effects.
* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 (+/- 2 days), the following tests and procedures will be performed (these can be done at your local physician's office):

* Your medical history will be reviewed, including any drugs you may be taking.
* You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects.
* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.
* Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

On Day 1 of Cycles 2-4 (+/- 2 days) and then once every 3 months, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* Your medical history will be reviewed, including any drugs you may be taking.
* You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects.
* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.
* You will have a performance status evaluation.
* Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
* If the doctor thinks it is necessary, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check the status of the disease.
* If the doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the status of the disease.
* During these visits, you will also be receiving your new supply of medication.

On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 2 and 3, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at your local doctor's office.

On Day 1 of Cycles 4, 7, and every 6th cycle after that (Cycles 13, 19, 25, and so on), you will have a bone marrow aspiration or biopsy to check the status of the disease. On Day 1 of Cycle 4, the bone marrow aspiration/biopsy will also look at the genes and chromosomes of the leukemia cells. If there is not enough information from the biopsy/aspirate, leftover blood will be used to look at this gene and chromosome information.

Every 2 weeks of Cycles 4-7, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

You will be called once a month while you are on study. During this phone call you will be asked how you are doing, if you have experienced any side effects, and if you are taking the study drug at the correct dose and time. This phone call will take a few minutes. You will be sent a card in the mail to remind you about any study visits you need to complete.

Women who are able to become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test if there is a suspicion of pregnancy. If the test is positive, they will then have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) pregnancy test.

Length of Study:

You may stay on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if you experience intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse.

End-of-Study Visit:

After you go off study you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

* Your medical history will be reviewed, including any drugs you may be taking.
* You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects.
* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.
* You will have a performance status evaluation.
* Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
* If the doctor thinks it is necessary, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check the status of the disease.

It is assumed that the above mentioned clinical parameters will improve due to physical exercise.","1. Background and study aims During the last decades, the prevalence of (pre)diabetes but also of chronic heart failure (CHF) has increased dramatically. Somehow, both conditions are linked, but the mechanisms involved have not been completely clarified yet. It is clear that the presence of (pre)diabetes in CHF patients affects morbidity and mortality. Although feasibility, safety and beneficial effects of exercise training in CHF are generally acknowledged, its effects on insulin resistance are not well understood. Therefore, the presented study aims to investigate the effect of ET on insulin resistance and the possible link with cardiac function, exercise tolerance, muscle strength and body composition in CHF patients.
2. What does the study involve?

   A randomized controlled study (n=30) will be performed over a period of 12 weeks. Following study inclusion, baseline measurements will be performed in 1 week. They include:
   * a maximal exercise test on a bicycle ergometer to assess exercise tolerance,
   * two oral glucose tolerance tests to assess fasting and post-exercise insulin resistance,
   * a venous blood sample to determine HbA1c, blood lipids, BNP,
   * a muscle strength measurement on a isokinetic dynamometer,
   * assessment of body composition via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry,
   * cardiac echography,
   * questionnaires to assess health-related quality of life,
   * a questionnaire (IPAQ) and a pedometer (3 days) to assess physical activity. Following baseline measurements, subjects will be randomized to a control group (CON, n=10) and an exercise intervention group (EX, n=20), matching for gender and reduced/preserved ejection fraction and glucose tolerance. Hereafter, CON will receive usual care and will be advised to maintain their normal lifestyle, EX subjects will be enrolled in a 12-week training program. Following 6 (MID) and 12 (POST) weeks of exercise training including progressive training load adaptations, baseline measurements will be repeated in all patients.
3. What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?

   * Benefits: patients receive a free training program with personal and professional supervision. After completing the study, they receive a report with personal results and evaluation of training effects.
   * Risks: the usual risks of exercise tolerance testing and exercise training in a CHF population are limited because training sessions are held in the supervised conditions of the Jessa hospital and because training characteristics are according to guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology.

* It is conceivable to discharge patients with successful PPCI as early as possible, because a hospital stay longer than needed may create undesirable outcomes in terms of hospital infections, psychosocial reasons, adequate mobilization and patient comfort.

In addition, it has been indicated that an early discharge policy may lead to a substantial cost saving.
* Although much work has been done in developing and validating risk scores that identify low risk patients, data on the implementation of early discharge strategies have been quite limited There are 3 randomised trials investigating the possibility of early discharge after PPCI. However, certain limitations of these studies are preventing to implement an early discharge strategy in all-comers, particularly because of the underrepresentation of older patients in clinical trials. The verification of this policy is also needed in patients with multivessel disease. The first prospective randomized trial, the PAMI II,7 is partly obsolete as major changes have been made in PPCI with respect to devices and adjunctive medication.

OTHER,NCT03511079,Music as a Perioperative Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients,Impact of Perioperative Music on Quality of Life Measures and Biomarker Levels in Breast Cancer Patients,"Music has often been used in hospitals as a therapy but there is a limited amount of research looking at how music actually affects the different molecules in the body, such as cortisol (a marker of stress). There is especially a lack of research in the context of surgery. The hope is that this study will show that music can be used to minimize some of the side effects related to breast surgery and improve the patient experience.","In medical practice, an ideal therapy should have maximal benefit with minimal risk. While considerable effort is being placed into discovering more effective pharmaceuticals, there is a growing field of interest in alternative therapies. In the 1970's, George Engle put forward the idea of the biopsychosocial response in which the patient's social and psychological factors can influence the body's biologic function and vice versa. One such potential therapy that could work by this mechanism is music. Advantages of music include low cost, availability, no required expertise, and minimal side effects. Studies have shown that music leads to reduced postoperative pain, anxiety, and analgesic needs in surgical patients. It has also been shown that patient selected music has greater outcomes than researcher selected music. While there is a significant body of literature on changes in clinical measurements, there are only two studies known to us which try to examine the effects of music on a molecular level, measuring cortisol and blood glucose respectively. Neither of these studies have been performed in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer.

On the other hand, considerable research is currently being conducted to determine biomarkers in the context of surgery that are associated with poor outcomes, especially in the context of breast surgery. Stress, usually associated with cortisol levels, has been associated with increased sleep disruption, increased metabolism, increased risk of thromboembolic events, and impaired wound healing in patients. In breast cancer patients, it has been found that C-reactive protein levels correlated in fatigue postoperatively and decreased diurnal variation in cortisol has been associated with depression. Melatonin, in general, is a marker for circadian rhythm and would also be representative of sleep disruption. C-reactive protein is primarily a marker of inflammation which in turn is associated with disease progression and poorer clinical outcomes in breast surgery patients.

This study aims to determine both if music affects molecular mechanisms through measurement of clinical biomarkers as well as if there is an association with significant quality of life measures. A positive association could provide evidence into music being used as an adjunct therapy peri-operatively.",WITHDRAWN,Difficulty with recruiting due to staffing and Covid-19,2019-07-10,2021-10-27,2021-10-27,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,0,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Music"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Music will be delivered through Pandora Plus radio via patient's computer or smartphone.

Understanding the most effective way to quickly re-adjust the body's internal clock will be beneficial for treating individuals with these conditions. This study will evaluate the combined effectiveness of light and non-light therapies at regulating sleep cycles and improving sleep quality.","Circadian rhythm disorders are disruptions in an individual's circadian rhythm, or ""internal body clock."" This internal clock regulates the 24-hour cycle of biological processes in the body, including sleep and hormone production. Jet lag, delayed sleep phase syndrome, in which individuals fall asleep and wake up later than desired, and advanced sleep phase syndrome, in which individuals fall asleep and wake up earlier than desired, are all examples of circadian rhythm disorders. Because of the disruptive nature of these conditions, it is important to identify the quickest and most effective method for regulating the body and reestablishing normal sleep patterns. Light therapy, in which individuals are exposed to bright, artificial light, is currently used to treat these disorders. Melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythms, and methylxanthines, a class of stimulant medications, are other common non-light treatments. While each of these individual treatments has been proven effective, little is known about the combined effect of light and non-light treatments. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of light therapy, melatonin, and methylxanthine, alone and in combination, at regulating circadian rhythms and improving sleep quality and cognitive function.

This study will enroll healthy individuals. Participants will first attend two screening visits, which will include a review of medical, psychiatric, and sleep histories; vital sign measurements; blood and urine collection; a physical examination; and an electrocardiogram. For 1 week, participants will record sleep habits in a diary and by telephone. They will also wear a device that monitors activity and light exposure levels. Eligible participants will then attend four 5-day inpatient visits at the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. During each of the four visits, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following four treatments:

* Dim light therapy and placebo
* Bright light therapy and placebo
* Dim light therapy, melatonin, and methylxanthines
* Bright light therapy, melatonin, and methylxanthines

At each visit, participants will receive a different treatment. During these visits, participants will remain awake for up to 40 hours at a time, while their eye movements, and brain, muscle, heart, and breathing activity are monitored. Urine and saliva will be collected, and participants will undergo various cognitive performance testing measures.

The prevalence rate in England is reported to be between 1-2.4%. OLP contributed to around 40% of all visits or 1,200 appointments in 2014 at the Eastman Dental Hospital. Pain, discomfort, long-standing use of medications, lesion recurrence and adverse side effects of therapy are commonly associated with OLP, eventually leading to a significant reduction in a patient quality of life. In addition, there is also increased risk of developing oral cancer in patients with OLP. The current gold standard treatment for OLP is corticosteroid, which can result in adverse side effects including increased risk of infections and skin cancer, reduced systemic immune system, and hepatotoxicity with long-term usage.

Alternatively, a probiotic food supplement, VSL#3, has shown evidence of been able to induce and maintain remission in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), with no adverse effect a part than bloating, reported. Additionally, a preliminary report shown that probiotics treatment in Behcet's disease and Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) lesion resulted in reducing the number of oral ulcerations and subjective relief of oral discomfort.

Investigator designed a clinical trial with 30 participants allocated to one of two interventions, VSL#3 or placebo. Individuals with biopsy-confirmed OLP who experience painful symptoms will be recruited from a single site research site (Eastman Dental Hospital (EDH)).

The main questions to be answered are:

* Is breastfeeding improved with this type of intervention?
* What type of intervention is better?
* After carrying out these interventions, does the baby need to undergo surgery if it presents a sublingual frenulum? Participants must be infants who are one week old and who have been diagnosed with ankyloglossia through the Hazelbaker Scale.

NIH,NCT00363779,Effect of Cyclosporine Therapy on Gene Expression in Patients With Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia,Microarray Analysis of the Effect of Cyclosporine Therapy on Gene Expression Patterns in Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia,"Background:

* Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
* LGL is associated with low numbers of white blood cells (leading to recurring infections), red blood cells (causing anemia) and platelets (causing abnormal bleeding).
* Cyclosporine (CSA) is an immunosuppressive drug that improves low blood cell counts in about 50 percent of patients with LGL leukemia.

Objectives:

* To identify what factors determine why cyclosporine works in some patients and not in others.
* To identify what causes low blood counts in LGL leukemia.

Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age and older with LGL leukemia.

Design:

* Patients have a medical history, physical examination blood tests, bone marrow biopsy and x-ray studies, including chest x-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Patients with an easily accessible enlarged lymph node have a node biopsy (removal of a small piece of tissue for microscopic examination).
* Patients take cyclosporine twice a day by mouth. Blood samples are taken at least weekly to adjust the cyclosporine dosing to maintain therapeutic serum levels.
* Patients undergo apheresis (collection of white blood cells) at a number of different time points in the study (maximum 6 times) to look at the differences in the leukemia cells before and during treatment with cyclosporine. For apheresis, blood is withdrawn through a needle in an arm vein and directed through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned through the same needle or through a second needle in the other arm.","Background:

* LGL leukemia is a low grade non-Hodgkins Lymphoma characterized by tissue invasion of the marrow, spleen and liver
* Recurrent infections due to chronic neutropenia and transfusion-dependent anemia are the principal causes for initiation of therapy
* Approximately 50% of patients treated with cyclosporine (CSA) respond to treatment. CSA appears to correct the associated cytopenia without decreasing LGL numbers, suggesting it may inhibit LGL secretion of yet unidentified mediators of neutropenia and anemia.
* Analysis of differential gene expression profiles in patients with LGL leukemia treated with cyclosporine has the potential to detect as yet unidentified, therapeutic targets and possibly provide predictors of CSA responsiveness.

Objective:

* Identify changes in gene expression patterns induced by cyclosporine therapy in patients with LGL leukemia
* Identify differences between responding and non-responding patients

Eligibility:

-Patients with Large Granular Lymphocyte leukemia

Design:

* Patients will be treated with cyclosporine at a dose of 5-10mg/kg/day in divided doses, with doses adjusted to maintain a therapeutic serum level between 200-400ng/ml. These therapeutic levels shall be maintained for 3 months.
* Tumor response will be evaluated after 3 months therapy, the dose of CsA may then be tapered to that required to sustain a response or discontinued if no evidence of response, or after relapse.

OTHER,NCT05735379,Impact in Older Adults of Reducing Anticholinergic and Sedative Rx Burden on Physical Function Measured by Wearables,Impact in Older Adults of Reducing Anticholinergic and Sedative Medication Burden on Physical Function Measured by Clinical Digital Phenotyping in Lab and Real-life Environments,"Medications with sedative or anticholinergic effects such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or opioids have been associated with impaired cognitive and physical function. They are referred to as potentially inappropriate medications or medications that are best avoided by older adults. The accumulated evidence has now shifted the clinical and research focus to evaluating the who, what, and how of the best way to deprescribe (i.e., dose reduction or cessation of these medications). The Drug Burden Index (DBI) allows researchers and clinicians to quantify the cumulative burden of anticholinergic and sedative medications in each patient. Deprescribing these medications is a complex health intervention based on trade-offs between their clinical benefits (e.g., symptom management and prevention of diseases) and their adverse drug events to improve physical and cognitive function. Existing physical function performance metrics, such as gait speed captured in the clinic, are often non-specific and do not reflect real-life performance. Innovative mobility metrics are required to better understand specific deficits with age and disease and the effects of medications on these deficits.

The goal of this project is to better characterize the impact of reducing the anticholinergic and sedative medication burden on physical function in older adults by novel mobility metrics in lab and real-life environments.

A prospective, longitudinal cohort of 182 community-dwelling older adults (≥ 65 years) with a DBI of ≥ 1 will be completed. Using a quasi-experimental design, recruited patients will undergo a medication deprescribing plan, as part of usual clinical care, that includes three gradual changes to their medication regimen resulting in three DBI levels. At each DBI level, physical function mobility including dual-task tests) will be assessed in the lab with wearable sensors during validated clinical tests such as the Short Physical Performance Battery. Objective balance and mobility metrics (e.g., sway area and frequency, stride length) will be extracted. Physical function will also be assessed continuously in the patient's real-life environment from recruitment to the last lab visit, using wearable (Apple Watch® with ankle inertial measurement unit) and environmental sensors. Cognition will be measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail Making Test Part A \& B, and Digit Symbol Substitution Test.",,RECRUITING,,2023-03-23,2025-12,2025-06,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,182,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Deprescribing anticholinergic and sedative mediications"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Deprescribing plan targeting a reduction in Drug Burden Index score of ≥ 0.5"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,deprescribing anticholinergic and sedative mediications,0

OTHER,NCT07060079,The Use of Entropy to Assess Sleep Disordered Breathing in Chronic Respiratory Disease,The Use of Entropy to Assess Sleep Disordered Breathing in Chronic Respiratory Disease,"Research is being conducted into chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung disease, and bronchiectasis. The investigation specifically focuses on sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in individuals with chronic respiratory disease. SDB encompasses a range of conditions, the most common of which is obstructive sleep apnoea. In obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic pauses in breathing (apnoea) lead to reduced blood oxygen levels. To detect these events, patients typically undergo sleep studies that involve monitoring oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory patterns during sleep. When chronic respiratory disease and SDB coexist, breathing disturbances during sleep may be exacerbated.

To identify SDB, sleep studies are commonly used to assess oxygen levels, heart rate, and breathing patterns. The objective of this research is to identify differences between patients with chronic respiratory diseases who have SDB and those who do not. This will be achieved by analysing sleep study data using a novel analytical approach. The aim is to determine whether this method can yield more detailed insights into the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions.","Sleep is a complex and dynamic interplay between the brain and various physiological systems. Functions such as heart rate, respiration, and brain wave activity are regulated by intricate physiological mechanisms involving nonlinear interactions across multiple control centres operating on different time scales. It is increasingly recognized that a more accurate understanding of physiological outputs can be achieved through nonlinear analytical approaches, rather than traditional linear methods such as the standard deviation of the mean.

Among nonlinear techniques, entropy is one of the most widely used metrics for assessing the irregularity of physiological signals. For example, sample entropy is a method used to quantify regularity in time series data and has demonstrated the ability to distinguish between healthy and diseased individuals. In some cases, recordings from a simple finger pulse oximeter (measuring oxygen saturation (SpO₂)) may be sufficient to screen for sleep apnoea, potentially reducing the need for full cardiorespiratory polygraphy.

While nonlinear methods are well established in cardiovascular research, their application to respiratory signal analysis in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) remains limited. This analytical approach may offer deeper insights into complex physiological interactions-such as those between oxygen saturation and heart rate using relatively simple equipment.

The aim of this study is to investigate differences in entropy values between healthy individuals and patients with chronic respiratory diseases, both with and without coexisting sleep-disordered breathing.",RECRUITING,,2025-04-30,2026-09-30,2026-08-30,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,120,ESTIMATED,[],,,0

Vascular permeability is controlled by endothelial glycocalyx. Several factors such as sepsis, ischemia / reperfusion, inflammatory mediators, trauma, surgery including the Cesarean Section and fluid overload can increase vascular permeability due to a glycocalyx damage.

During Cesarean Section under subarachnoid anesthesia, hypotension may occur. It is a common side effect caused by reduced preload due to aortocaval compression by the uterus. Furthermore, subarachnoid anesthesia causes block of the sympathetic preganglionic fibers which is associated with vasodilation. These changes often require the use of vasopressors and fluids.

A fluid overload associated with the physiological and pathological factors discussed earlier might cause an increased risk of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure (IRA) in women undergoing cesarean section under arachnoid anesthesia.

IRA occurs in less than 0.2% of total pregnancies but it is one of the most common cause of admission to intensive care unit in pregnant women.

Among the causes that can lead to IRA in the last trimester of pregnancy we find pneumopathies such as asthma, pulmonary embolism due to amniotic fluid and pulmonary edema related to severe preeclampsia.

Diagnosis of pulmonary edema can be clinical or sub-clinical through laboratory tests such as BNP (b-type natriuretic peptide). It might also be necessary to execute instrumental examinations such as chest radiography (contraindicated in pregnancy) or trans-thoracic ultrasound.

Newborn screening ensures equity and allows all babies to have the same chance at the healthiest life.

Families will be invited to the study shortly after the baby is born and will learn the decision not to participate, and we will interview a subset of parents who agree to be interviewed. Newborns who screen positive will be referred to appropriate providers for care and will be followed through review of electronic medical records and parental follow up via phone, text, postal mail or email.","Newborn screening (NBS) is the process of screening all newborns for select conditions shortly after birth. This process reduces morbidity and mortality by the detection of medically actionable conditions in pre-symptomatic newborns. Approximately 1 in every 180 newborns is diagnosed with a condition through NBS. NBS is a public health service; every infant regardless of health insurance or ability to pay is tested. NBS ensures equity and allows all babies to have the same chance at the healthiest life. Effective NBS requires coordination and collaboration from multiple stakeholders - the parents, the hospital of birth, state department of health lab, the pediatrician, and the specialty referral center.

Conditions included on the NBS must fulfill several criteria: 1) significant clinical benefit for the newborn early in life including treatment administered within the first few years of life, 2) readiness of public health departments to effectively screen for the condition, and 3) feasibility of successful implementation of population screening. In the United States, screening of newborns is under the purview of state public health departments. Each state decides which disorders to screen, and expansions to each state's panel of screened conditions. The federal government also plays a role through the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC).

However, several factors can contribute to perception errors including: different lighting variables, multiple shade systems available in the market with lack of standardization in color systems and corresponding porcelain systems, individual human variables in color perception and lack of understanding of color science.

Therefore, in order to eliminate the uncontrolled variables during the color matching process, instrumental methods have been developed. Spectrophotometric measurement methods employing computer calculations, based on color science and theories, allow quantitative evaluation which is objective and appears to be more accurate. However, extremely high costs, relatively low performance with respect to agreements of the computer-aided devices, and edge loss error make it less acceptable.

A Double-Blind Cross Over Randomized Controlled Trial,"I. Title of Proposed Research Project Dextrose 10% Drink Increase Blood Sugar and Sprint Velocity Compared to Sodium Dextrose in Soccer Players

II. Specific Aims This study aims to evaluate the ergogenic effect in terms of blood sugar, VO2 max and sprint speed of dextrose 10% compared with sodium dextrose 10% in young male soccer players.

III. Background Sports drinks are designed to provide CHO, electrolytes, and fluids to the body, which are absorbed very fast from the small intestine. In other words, the period from ingestion until the CHO, electrolytes, and fluids reach the muscles, brain and so on, should be very short. This is the most important advantage of using sports drinks (Simulescu, Ilia, Macarie, \& Merghes, 2019). Commercial sports drinks generally contain both of CHO and sodium; To the best of the investigator's knowledge, there is no trial in which compare the differential effect of solely dextrose supplementation versus sodium dextrose in soccer players in terms of BG concentration, VO2 max and sprint speed, which may give a new paradigm for the available ergogenic sports drink.","Male academy soccer players, included in a trial, received two types of solutions (compound of 150 cc dextrose 10% + 20 mM sodium or single 150 cc dextrose 10%) interchangeably, separated within 120 minutes were completed in a counterbalanced, randomized, double-blind, crossover design. The study was approved by the Faculty of Medicine Hasanuddin University Research Ethics Committee. This trial was conducted at UNM Banta-Bantaeng, Makassar, Indonesia, from April 2019 to May 2019. All participants were within the last meal four hours prior to the test. Exclusion criteria were the use of amylase supplement, suffering from fever and diarrhea, using laxative agents within 24 h, consuming CHO absorption inhibitors, caffeine, creatinine, beta alanine, sodium bicarbonate supplement within 24 h, mean arterial pressure \<65mmHg, knee or muscle injuries, history of diabetes mellitus and heart disease, going through ketogenic diet program, history of gastrointestinal surgery, and total body fat percentages \> 30%.

Dietary intake was collected using two days food recall. BG were measured using portable glucometer (Aviva; Accucheck, Roche Diagnostics, Indiana, U.S.A), blood pressure were measured using aneroid sphygmomanometer (R1 shock-proof; Riester, Jungingen, Germany), heart rate were measured with wrist band pulse monitor (Bluetooth 4.0 wireless sport heart rate monitor WP290; Egoman, Shenzen, China), body weight, muscle, fat, water, metabolic rate were measured using body composition analyzer (BC-545N; Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), body height were measured using stadiometer (HR-200, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), sprint speed were measured using digital stopwatch (S23589 S23589P1; Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) Participants were instructed to refrain from strenuous physical activity in the 2 days preceding trial sessions and recorded all food consumed in the 2 days before the trial. Food records subsequently were analyzed using professional German nutrition software (EBISpro, Nutrisurvey 2007). On arrival at the field, pre supplementation capillary blood samples were collected, and then all players run for 2x100 m and calculated the VO2max using Uth-Sorenen-Overgaard-Pedersen Formula and sprint speed was recorded. After doing the baseline measurement, each player waited for 15 minutes in order to consume either dextrose or sodium dextrose solution, and then waited for 15 minutes to had another subsequent capillary blood samples measurement. After that, the players run for 2x100 m, recorded the VO2max and sprint speed. The players remained in a rested state for 120 minutes as a crossover washed-out period, and then did the same protocol with different solution.

All data are expressed as mean ± SD unless otherwise stated, with 95% confidence interval, and significance was accepted at p \< 0.05. Data were checked for normality as indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Paired t tests were used to compare before and after condition in blood sugar, VO2max and sprint speed. Data was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 25; IBM Corp., Chicago, IL. To interpret the magnitude of effect, Cohen's d effect sizes (±95% confidence limits) were estimated using a purpose built spreadsheet, with effect size thresholds set at \<0.20, \>0.50, and \>0.80 for small, moderate, large, effects respectively.",COMPLETED,,2019-03-25,2019-06-30,2019-05-28,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,30,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""10% Dextrose"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""A mixture of 150 cc dextrose 10% in oral formulation"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Natrium Dextrose"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""A mixture of 150 cc dextrose 10% + 20 cc sodium in oral formulation"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG;DRUG,10% dextrose;natrium dextrose,1

This therapy has been previously used for sports and joint injuries and is marketed for relaxation of muscle spasms, re-education of muscle action, prevention of disuse atrophy, increased local blood circulation, and maintaining or increasing range of motion. The investigators would like to explore the idea that physically exercising the muscles of the residual limb and increasing blood flow to the site of amputation through the promotion of motor contraction using electrical stimulation decreases chronic phantom limb pain.","There are a large number of people living with an amputation due mainly to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and trauma; and of these there is evidence to show that up to 80% of amputees experience phantom limb pain (PLP). PLP is classified as cramping, burning, shooting, or stabbing pain in the missing limb following an amputation. Current treatments include pharmacological drugs, anesthesia, additional surgery, mirror therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and others. TENS, as usually implemented, has been used to effectively reduce pain in multiple spots of the body, but has shown little effect in reducing phantom limb pain especially long term even with varying the frequency and intensity of the electrical stimulation. These current treatments can be invasive, costly, and have shown only to offer immediate relief. Using an electrical stimulator at a higher intensity has proven to to reduce pain and increase healing in numerous sports and joint related injuries. Anecdotally, the investigators have learned that a similar treatment protocol when applied to persons with phantom limb pain can mitigate their pain. The goal of this pilot study is to assess the effectiveness of higher intensity electrical stimulation in the management of PLP and also to acquire data to inform the investigators to the most appropriate study design and power for a future more formal clinical trial. To accomplish this the investigators will utilize the ACP Omnistim FX2 Pro electrical stimulator, that has been provided to us by Accelerated Care Plus (ACP) Corporation, to physically exercise the muscles of the residual limb and hence increase the local blood flow and explore it's potential for treatment of PLP both short and long term.

This study will train clinicians about how to use a context-adapted decision aid (DA) and SDM to conduct goals-of-care discussions with the elderly. The objectives of this study are to: 1) determine if the use of the DA and SDM training program: a) increase clinicians' engagement of patients in decision making regarding their goals of care; b) increase adoption of evidence-based behaviours regarding goals-of-care decision making; and 2) identify patients' most frequent incomprehension, concerns, questions and clinicians' opportunities to improve the skills in goals-of-care decision making.

Methods: This study will have three phases. Phase I (May-June 2017) will be a baseline evaluation of the current goals-of-care decision making process with elderly patients in a single ICU setting (Levis, Quebec). Phase II (July-August 2017) will be an evaluation of the goals-of-care decision making process in the same ICU using a DA. Phase III (September-December 2017) will be the delivery of an online and in-person training session about the use of the DA and about how to conduct discussions about goals-of-care. The study will then evaluate the goals-of-care decision making process after completion of the training program and using the DA. The investigators will observe and audio- or video-record all eligible elderly-intensivist dyads discussing goals of care during each phase. Two investigators will analyse the recordings using the OPTION 12 scale (measuring the extent that clinicians engage patients in SDM) and the ACCEPT quality indicators (measuring the extent to which intensivists engage in best practice goals-of-care discussions). The investigators will conduct qualitative content analysis of the video and audio records to identify patients' most frequent incomprehension, concerns, questions and clinicians' opportunities to improve the goals-of-care decision-making skills.

Deliverables: This study will produce evidence regarding the impact of a context-adapted DA and training program on clinicians' adoption of SDM and other best practice behaviors regarding goals-of-care decision making with the elderly, and evidence regarding the most frequent patients' incomprehension, concerns, questions and clinicians' opportunities to improve the goals-of-care decision-making skills.",,COMPLETED,,2017-05-23,2018-01-22,2018-01-22,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,SEQUENTIAL,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,26,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""decision aid"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""One hour online training about shared-decision making about goals-of-care and best practices regarding goals-of-care discussions and decision-making.

Epacadostat (INCB024360) is an Inhibitor of Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a 403 amino acid cytosolic haem enzyme encoded by the INDO gene on human chromosome 8p22. IDO1 is responsible for the catabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan (trp) to kynurenine (kyn) within immune cells and a subset of tumor cells resulting in inhibition of antitumor cell-mediated immune responses. Increased IDO activity correlates with lower CR rates and shorter OS in AML.

OTHER,NCT03535779,Characterisation of Human B Cell Maturation in Response to Vaccination,Characterisation of Human B Cell Maturation in Response to Vaccination,"This study is an exploratory single site sample collection study at St Mary's hospital campus, Imperial College London. Sixteen participants scheduled to receive routine immunizations for Td/IPV (group 1) and HBsAg (group 2) will be recruited overall. Eights participants will be allocated to group 1 and eights participants to group 2 depending on their immunisation regime.","The aim of the study is to characterise the maturation of human B cell response to immunization with vaccines (HBsAg and Td/IPV) known to induce long-term memory responses.

The primary objective is to characterize the number and phenotype of memory B cells induced by routine vaccination. These responses will be used as a comparison to those currently induced in HIV-1 vaccination trials.

The development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is highly dependent on our understanding of the immune response to HIV-1 infection/vaccination. It is generally accepted that the generation of long-lived neutralising memory B cell antibody responses will be critical for an effective vaccine against HIV-1. Successful vaccines are capable of inducing long-lived B cell memory that can maintain antibodies for decades, typical examples being those induced by Hepatitis B (HBsAg) and tetanus vaccination which generates antibodies with a half-life of greater than 5 years. In contrast, current HIV-1 vaccination typically induces a short-lived B cell response with antibodies waning within a half-life of 6 months. Recent observations have shown that vaccination does not produce a homogenous population of memory B cell but rather a constellation of subsets depending on the type of vaccination.

Investigators are only beginning to understand the varying and important roles of some of these elusive subsets. Therefore understanding potential differential responses of these memory B cell subsets to successful licensed vaccines may prove critical in the creation of novel, effective vaccines to HIV-1.

The field has been energised in recent years by the identification of different memory B cell subsets. Four of these subsets can be characterised through differential expression of surface markers CD27, IgD and IgM, typically: CD27+IgD+IgM+ B cells, CD27+IgD-IgM+ B cells, CD27+IgD+IgM- B cells and CD27+IgD-IgM- IgG+/IgA+/IgE+ B cells (Mroczek ES et al, Front Immunol. 2014;5:96). Understanding how HBsAg and tetanus (as part of the Td/IPV vaccine) modulates antigen specific responses across these four memory B cell subsets will help define how Investigators understand the establishment of long-term immunological memory and may help us understand how Investigators can induce such memory responses with new HIV vaccine candidates. Data from these studies will be used to compare responses elicited by HIV vaccines in current phase I studies and determine potential defects in the maturation of vaccine induced memory.

Investigators therefore wish to obtain blood draws from individuals undergoing routine HBsAg and Td/IPV vaccination. This will allow us to isolate memory B cells circulating in the peripheral blood and characterise the different memory B cell subsets induced by effective licensed vaccines and compare responses to those induced by current HIV-1 vaccination trials, for which Investigators already have samples banked.",COMPLETED,,2017-03-06,2018-03-13,2017-06-15,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,16,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Hepatitis B"", ""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""description"": ""The Hepatitis B virus, is a double stranded DNA virus that prevents Hepatitis B in the population"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Tetanus Toxoid"", ""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""description"": ""The Tetanus vaccine, also known as tetanus toxoid (Td/IVP), is an inactive vaccine used to prevent tetanus in the population"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BIOLOGICAL;BIOLOGICAL,hepatitis b;tetanus toxoid,1

The main questions it aims to answer are the J-Tip effect upon:

1. Pain during intra-dermal local anesthetic administration
2. Pain during subcutaneous local anesthetic administration
3. Pain during paracentesis
4. Procedure-related anxiety

Participants will be randomly assigned to have their skin numbed either in the usual way with a needle or with the J-Tip. Participants will be responsible for having a paracentesis done in their hospital room and answering the survey questions regarding pain experienced during the procedure and how they would feel if they needed to have this procedure performed again. There is also a telephone follow-up survey 2 days after the procedure to ask the participant about their experience post-procedure. We will also collect data about any procedure complications.","The investigators would like to conduct an open label randomized control trial quantifying perception of pain during both administration of local anesthetic and during abdominal paracentesis when superficial (intradermal) lidocaine is administered via needle-free injection system as compared to via 25-gauge needle (standard of care). The study will include at least 110 participants in the emergency room or admitted to a general medical service with cirrhosis and ascites requiring bedside paracentesis, including both diagnostic (only a small sample of fluid removed for testing) and/or therapeutic paracentesis (a large amount of fluid removed to relieve discomfort). The primary physician caring for the patient will determine whether a paracentesis is required (not the study investigators).

Patients ≥ 18 years of age presenting to Northwestern Memorial Hospital with cirrhosis of the liver and ascites who require bedside paracentesis will be eligible for this study. Eligible patients will be identified by Emergency Department and Hospital Medicine providers who will notify study investigators. Upon identifying the patients and confirming eligibility through reviewing patients' charts and verbal screening questions, a study team member will approach patients, explain the study, and obtain written informed consent for those patients willing to participate. Patients whose preferred language is not English, those who have previously received or are currently receiving chemotherapy (as the J-Tip is contra-indicated in patients receiving chemotherapy), and those who are otherwise unable to provide informed consent will be excluded. Pregnant patients, prisoners, or other detained individuals will be excluded as well.

Upon enrollment, patients will be randomized using a randomization module built into the REDCap project, to either the control (25-gauge needle) or J-Tip arm. Patients will undergo diagnostic and/or therapeutic ultrasound-guided paracentesis as per standard of practice. The only difference between the groups will be the method of administering the superficial (intradermal) anesthesia. Based on randomization, lidocaine will be administered superficially via either 25-gauge intradermal needle (control) or the J-tip Needle-Free injection system. Following this superficial anesthesia injection, both groups will receive deeper subcutaneous lidocaine via a second 22-gauge needle per standard of care.

Following the procedure, the patient will be asked by a study coordinator (in person or over the phone) to rate their pain using a numeric rating scale (NRS from 1 to 10; 0= no pain, 10 = extreme pain). Patients will also be asked about anticipated anxiety during future procedures. The thickness of skin tissue and tissue deep to the skin (subcutaneous tissue) overlying the ascites fluid in millimeters as measured by ultrasound will also be measured by the study investigators (Dr. Kahn or Dr. Barsuk) and recorded. Drs. Kahn and Barsuk are on the Hospital Medicine Procedure Service and are routinely consulted to perform paracentesis procedures on patients.

At each visit the dentist will look at the mouth, teeth, tongue and gums of participants, and check for sensitive teeth.

During the first 2 weeks, participants will brush their teeth 2 times a day with the fluoride toothpaste provided.

Then, if they qualify to continue in the study, participants will be assigned to one of two treatment groups for the last 4 weeks. Both groups will use assigned toothpaste currently sold on the market. Both groups will each have an investigative mouth rinse to use as well. Participants will have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the three groups.

For the next 4 weeks, participants will use their assigned products according to the directions provided. At Visit 1, participants will be supervised while they brush their teeth to ensure they understand the directions. They will also have supervised use of the products at Visit 2.

Results will be analyzed to assess whether the mouthwashes help to reduce tooth sensitivity during the study.","This study will consist of run-in and treatment phases. To qualify for the study, participants must meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and return tactile sensitivity scores within protocol-specified parameters at both the screening and baseline visits.

Run-in will consist of a 2-week period during which participants will use a sodium fluoride dentifrice. At the start of the first phase, participants will attend a Screening Visit. They will participate in the informed consent process, complete a medical/dental history, and be evaluated for tactile sensitivity to Yeaple probe and response to a cold air stimulus.

Participants who qualify through screening will begin a run-in period that will last approximately two weeks. The run-in period will be followed by a Baseline visit. Participants who continue to qualify through Baseline will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.

During the four-week treatment period, all participants will brush their teeth twice daily for at least one minute in their usual manner, with their assigned toothpaste. After brushing, participants will rinse with water, and then rinse with 10 mL of their assigned experimental mouth rinse for 60 seconds.

The intervention package focuses on the pregnancy and early postpartum period.","The aim of this study is to implement and evaluate the mCARE-II intervention package using a randomized controlled trial design. This package, supported by an mHealth application, provides workflow scheduling for guided household registration, census, pregnancy surveillance, and antenatal, postnatal, and essential newborn care visit reminders. Workflow scheduling is sorted and prioritized based on assessment of basic risk. Furthermore, the system integrates client-directed reminder SMS messages and demand-side birth notifications to schedule postnatal services immediately after birth. This will be operated by the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) community health workers, called Family Welfare Assistants (FWAs), in 18 unions of one northern district of Bangladesh who will use the system to support their routine health service delivery functions.

ALS patients feature an intrinsic hypermetabolism as signified by an increased resting energy expenditure, which significantly contributes to progressive weight loss and cachexia. The extent of weight loss is an independent prognostic factor for survival in ALS. It has been shown that survival of ALS mice can be prolonged by applying a high-caloric nutrition. Furthermore, ALS patients feature distinct alterations of lipid metabolism, and various studies suggest a protective effect of high triglyceride serum levels.

Materials and Methods: 36 complete edentulous patients who already have maxillary dentures and complaining of instable mandibular dentures will be invited to participate in this study. Mandibular dentures will be relined randomly by one of three relining materials: two chairside relining materials (Tokuyama Rebase II Fast, Tokuyama Dental Co, Japan), and (Flexacryl Hard, Lang Co, USA) and one heat cured acrylic resin (Vertex, Dental technology Co, Holland).

The color stability of relining material, peeling, and the effect on supporting tissue will be assessed by two separate prosthodontists after 3 and 6 months of follow up. In addition, patients will be asked to grade there overall satisfaction on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100.","Relining denture is a process of resurfacing the tissue side of a denture to make it fit more accurately Direct relining of removable dentures with hard chair-side reline materials is suitable for improving the fit of the denture bases to the supporting tissues. Chairside reline materials are more convenient than those processed in a laboratory because the direct method is faster and does not cause clinically significant dimensional changes of the reline resin. However, when autopolymerized reline resins are used with a direct method, several problems can occur as burning sensation caused by monomers, an exothermic heat reaction and an unpleasant odor.

There are three types of hard relining chair-side materials: Dual-polymerized Visible light-polymerized as Triad DuaLine, Light Liner (Hard), Astron LC (Hard).Visible light-polymerized as Lightdon-U, Triad Hi-Flow Reline Material, Triad VLC Reline Material. Finally, autopolymerized as New Truline, Tokuyama Rebase II (Fast) , GC Reline. Other concerns related to direct reline materials include patient tolerance (taste, temperature, odor), color stability, durability and ease of handling and polishing.

Few studies evaluated the effect of disinfection solutions on relining materials properties as roughness and hardness. In one study, disinfectant solutions caused a decrease in hardness, whereas with roughness, the materials tested showed a statistically significant increase, except for Tokuyama. Depending on the examined relining materials, some materials have increased and the others have decreased surface roughness after immersion in disinfecting solutions or microwave disinfection.

All previous laboratory studies concentrated on the effects of disinfection on relining materials properties as roughness, hardness, color change. However, the clinical studies did not compare chemically cured and heat cured relining materials and their effects on supporting tissue.

Phase 1 stabilization phase lasting one month. Participants with low protein intake (\<1.0 g/kg/day) are provided with national guidelines for daily protein intake and publicly available information material and recommended to increase their protein intake to meet the guidelines. Compliance to the recommendation/ guidelines (eating \>1.0 g/kg/day) will be evaluated by 4-day food records at the end of the stabilization phase. Only compliant participants are eligible for phase 2. Participants that are not compliant will be followed as ""natural observational group"" but will not be considered for the primary statistical analysis. Data collection in these participants will only include assessment of selected demographic, functional and nutritional parameters and semi-structured interviews to identify potential barriers for not improving protein intake. Semi-descriptive data will be presented if possible.

Phase 2: Three-arm randomized controlled trial lasting four months:

i) Protein-only (PROT): participants will receive milk-based protein-rich products with the aim of targeting a daily protein intake of 1.5 g/kg; ii) Exercise and Protein (EXEPROT): participants will receive the protein intervention as in the PROT-group combined with progressive explosive type heavy-resistance strength training two times per week iii) Recommendations (REC) participants receive the national nutritional recommendations for older adults and are recommended to follow these recommendations over the course of the study.

Nutritional data will be collected pre and post the stabilization phase. Collection of the primary and secondary outcomes will occur at baseline (pre phase 2) and at the 4-month follow-up (post phase 2). Nutritional assessment will also be evaluated halfway, at the 2-month follow-up.

Compliance Adherence to the exercise protocol and protein supplementation is recorded during the study. For the exercise protocol adherence will be considered as achieving minimum to 75% of valid training sessions, considered as minimum 70% of the exercises planned for each session. For the protein supplementation, adherence will be evaluated as daily protein intake of ≥ 1.35 g/kg (estimated from 24 hours recall and four-day food records) at the 2-month follow-up and at the 4-months follow-up. Compliance will also be estimated from during each delivery of products with a set of questions (e.g. how much of the supplement is consumed? Any changes to the habitual food intake?) and regular phone follow-ups. If participants are unable to reach the protein target additional face to face or phone interview will be planned to support adherence. For the REC-group adherence is defined as following the recommended intake of protein (1.0-1.3 g/kg/day).

Sample size and statistics Lower leg muscle power is the primary outcome of this study. Due to lack of studies similar to this study design (e.g. age and frailty status of the participants, type of exercise and level of protein supplementation) the investigators have calculated sample size using a combination of studies and methods. Based on findings from a 2017 study the effect of 12-weeks of protein supplementation (two daily supplements of 20 g milk protein) in combination with resistance training in +80-year-old healthy adults increased muscle power by 15% (SEM ± 5%) in comparison with -7% (SEM ± 6%) in the control group (receiving protein supplementation only). A result from a 2018 study indicate that 12 weeks of nutritional supplementation (0.8 g/kg/day, 1.2 g/kg/day or 1.5 g/kg/day) to pre-frail or frail older adults \>70 years resulted in an increase in muscle mass (estimated by Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry, DXA) of approximately 4% in the group receiving 1.5 g/kg/day. Unpublished data from the investigators research group show that change in muscle mass (estimated by DXA) accounted for 1,95% of the change in muscle power in older adults following 12 weeks of resistance training. Hence, the estimated effect of an increase in muscle mass of 4% on muscle power is 7,8%. Adding this to the results from the 2017 study gives an estimated change on 0,8% in the PROT-group. Assuming, that the change in muscle mass are comparable in the three groups the investigator therefore expect a change in muscle power of 15%, 0,8% and -7% with a standard deviation (SD) of 30 in the EXEPROT-, PROT- and REC-group, respectively.

Setting a power of 0.8 sample size with 37 participants in each arm should be enough to detect a significant difference in muscle power (significance level at 0.05). Adding 25% to account for dropouts a total of 150 participants is needed.

TAK is observed predominantly in Asian females under 40 years of age \[2, 3\]. The stenosis or occlusion of blood vessels can cause severe ischemic events (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, stroke, death) involving multiple organs. Patients with TAK experience impaired quality of life \[4\] and face a significantly higher risk of death compared with that in the sex- and age-matched general population, with a standardized mortality ranging from 2.7 to 17.3 \[5, 6, 7\]. Thus, timely and efficacious treatment is important to improve the prognosis in such a young population.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the first-line therapy for active TAK \[8, 9\]. High-dose GCs are initially efficacious. However, disease recurrence can occur in approximately 60% patients during the GCs tapering \[10, 11\]. Prolonged use of GCs is associated with significant toxicity, including glucose-metabolism disorders, cardiovascular adverse events (AEs), and osteoporosis \[12, 13\]. Therefore, immunosuppressive therapy is required to minimize the dose and duration of GC exposure \[8, 9\]. Conventional immunosuppressants have been recommended as GC-tapering agents for active TAK, whereas biological agents are recommended in refractory cases \[8, 9\]. Most previous studies focused on TAK treatment have been observational, only five randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are found, among which, just one study reported the effect of conventional immunosuppressants mycophenolate \[14, 15, 16, 17, 18\]. Thus, high-quality evidence to support therapeutic options of conventional immunosuppressants is very limited.

Leflunomide (LEF) is a conventional immunosuppressant \[19\], which has shown satisfied GC-tapering effects in the treatment of giant cell arteritis, another large vessel vasculitis, in several observational studies \[20, 21, 22\]. In 2012, the first open-label study of 14 TAK patients demonstrated that 70% of patients could achieve at least partial clinical remission, and the GC dose could be reduced by 50% during LEF treatment \[23\]. Since then, several observational cohort or case-control studies have reported the efficacy of LEF for active TAK \[24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\]. A most recent study reported a comparable complete response rate of LEF (78%) versus adalimumab (88%) at 15-month follow-up \[30\]. Thus, LEF would be a promising alternative treatment for TAK, but evidence from RCTs is lacking.

We conducted this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of LEF versus placebo combined with prednisone for active TAK, namely ""Takayasu arteritis clinical trial in China"" (TACTIC; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02981979).",COMPLETED,,2016-12-22,2022-11-22,2022-05-22,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,116,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Leflunomide(LEF)"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Leflunomide:\n\nFor LEF arm, 20mg per day, p.o. through the whole study.

OTHER,NCT03543579,Cardiovascular Complications of Carfilzomib Treatment,An Observational Study of Cardiovascular Complications of Carfilzomib Treatment in Clinical Practice,"Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis of a pathophysiological role of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) in the process of atherosclerosis and vascular function. However the data are contradicting in respect to the direction of this association and therefore the net effect of UPS activity on the cardiovascular system is not known. Inhibitors of UPS are currently standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Heart failure and hypertension have been reported in studies of carfilzomib, an irreversible 2nd generation proteasome inhibitor, both as a single agent and in combination with other drugs but their potential vascular toxicity is not adequately studied. Furthermore, as the role of the UPS has not been studied yet clinically but only in experimental and autopsy based studies, assessment of UPS inhibition in humans would facilitate understanding of the UPS-mediated pathophysiologic mechanisms in human atherosclerosis. Thus, this project may stimulate further research on the role of UPS in atherogenesis and potential new therapeutic approaches on vascular dysfunction may arise. We designed the following project in order to investigate the acute and chronic effect of Carfilzomib (CFZ) on cardiovascular function. Patients with an indication to receive CFZ will be recruited to be followed in the Clinical Therapeutics Department in pre-specified timepoints. Functional and structural measurements including markers of arterial stiffness and subclinical atherosclerosis will be performed using non-invasive well-validated techniques. Blood pressure will be also evaluated using 24h hour ambulatory monitoring. Evaluation of cardiac function will be performed at baseline and thereafter at 6 months or earlier if a suspicious event occurs necessitating evaluation of cardiac function. In parallel and at each time point, the activity of UPS and intracellular levels of ubiquitin conjugates will be measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) using enzymatic proteasome activity assays and western blot techniques, respectively.","This is an observational, non interventional, prospective study. Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy and who receive carfilzomib with dexamethasone according to the approved dose and schedule will be included in this observational study. No specific treatment intervention related to the study is going to be performed. No specific harms or benefits are expected due to study investigations.

Objectives and Purpose: The present study will assess patients with multiple myeloma receiving the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (CFZ), in order to investigate, in vivo, a wide spectrum of human atherosclerosis indices, from cardiovascular risk factors to subclinical atherosclerosis at multiple successive stages in a human model under conditions of global UPS inhibition, and correlate with cardiovascular complications associated with carfilzomib therapy, in patients receiving carfilzomib with dexamethasone.

Primary objective: To investigate cardiovascular complications and the role of the UPS inhibition on atheromatosis and vascular function and inflammation, in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma who are receiving carfilzomib and dexamethasone.

Secondary objective(s): To outline the clinical significance of carfilzomib toxicity in hemodynamic parameters and vascular function and structure in humans

Duration of the study: Patients will receive therapy until disease progression or as per physician's decision regarding the patient's best interest and according to the approved indications. Study accrual and collection of data will be completed in two years. The study can be terminated for any reason and at any time by the Sponsor.

Population: The study will include patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy (2) and who according to physicians' decision are treated with carfilzomib dexamethasone in the approved indication, doses and schedule. Briefly, patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, at last one prior treatments, will be included.

Carfilzomib treatment: According to the approved indications patients will be given carfilzomib at a dose of 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1; and thereafter at a dose of 56 mg/m2, in a 30 min intravenous infusion, on days 1,2,8,9,15 and 16. Dexamethasone (40mg IV) will be administered 24-48 hours before first CFZ infusion in order to assess the individual vascular effects of each drug separately; subsequently dexamethasone will be given IV at a dose of 20 mg on days 1,2,8,9,15 and 16, and orally on days 22 and 23 of a 28-day cycle. The rationale for using these doses is based on the results of the ENDEAVOR study and the approved indications and dosing of KYPROLIS. Intravenous hydration (250-500 mL before and after dose administration) is going to be given during cycle 1 and at the investigator's discretion thereafter.

Sample size: This is an observational study with non interventional design. Sample size calculation is made on the basis of previous data indicating that at least 2% absolute difference in Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) (corresponding to 20-30% relative difference) is considered significant and clinically relevant. With the null hypothesis being that CFZ/Dex therapy is associated with \<10% relative difference in FMD and the alternative hypothesis being that a ≥30% difference is considered as significant, and with an a=0.05, a sample of 40 patients is required for 90% power of detecting these differences (all tests are 2-sided). A dropout rate of 15% is assumed. A total number of 46 patients is thus calculated to be enrolled.

Studied parameters History record: A detailed history will be obtained from every subject and all possible risk factors that could be associated with an increased risk of cardiac and vascular adverse events including thorough clinical examination along with ECG and cardiac echocardiography to ensure that every patient has an ejection fraction ≥40% thus being eligible for enrollment.

Assessment of arterial stiffness: Arterial stiffness in the aorta by measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV).

Central blood pressures and reflected waves in the aorta: Non-invasive estimation of aortic pressure waveforms and reflected waves by pulse wave analysis (PWA) will be performed. The following indices are measured: a. augmentation index (AI, percentage) normalized for the heart rate of 75 bpm, expressed as a percentage of the aortic pulse pressure, b. central systolic and diastolic pressures (cBP), c. time to the beginning of the reflected wave (in milliseconds) and d. blood pressure amplification calculated as the ratio of peripheral pulse pressure: central pulse pressure.

Endothelial function by ultrasound measurement of endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD): Endothelial function will be assessed by Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD)

Carotid and Femoral Intima-Media Thickness (IMT): Carotid intima-media thickness (ccIMT) will be measured at the distal 1.0 cm of the common carotid proximal to the bifurcation. Femoral IMT (fIMT) will be measured on each side, scanning a 1cm-long arterial segment proximal to the femoral bifurcation, defined as the common femoral artery segment and the average value of IMT of the far wall will be estimated.

Ankle Brachial Index (ABI): The ABI is a simple, non-invasive diagnostic test for lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with high validity of the test for stenosis ≥50% in leg arteries (sensitivity ≈95% and specificity ≈100%).

All the above mentioned vascular measurements will be performed at each time point, that is on baseline and days 1,2,8,9,15 and 16 of cycle 1 and on days 1,2 of cycle 2 and 3 before and 2 hours after drug administration. The B-Mode ultrasound of the carotid and femoral arteries will only be performed at baseline. On cycle 6 all vascular measurements will be repeated to assess the chronic effect of proteasome inhibition on vascular function and atherosclerosis.

24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM): Patients will have their blood pressure monitored for 24 hours during the 1st day of cycles 1, 2, 3 and 6.

Cardiac Ultrasonography: Study participants will undergo a baseline echocardiographic examination before the initiation of the treatment.

Study of Proteasome activity: In order to examine the molecular and cellular effects of therapeutic inhibitors in blood cells of MM patients, we will proceed to isolation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). The blood samples which will be used in this research will be collected between specific time points of therapeutic proteasomal inhibitors administration.

Although inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), β-blockers and aldosterone-receptor blockers have improved the treatment of heart failure, mortality of HF remains unacceptably high.

Recently, we identified a key metabolite N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) increased in the plasma of patients with heart failure. Also, elevated plasma Neu5Ac, independent of other traditional risk factors, is associated with poor prognosis in patients with HF in long-term follow up. Neu5Ac levels, the most common sialic acid in mammals, generated from sialylated glycoconjugates by neuraminidase. Neu5Ac and its regulatory enzyme neuraminidase play a key role in heart failure. We found neuraminidase inhibitor could reduce Neu5Ac levels and improve heart failure in mice model, providing opportunity for a novel therapeutic strategy in HF. Neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir is also an old anti-influenza drug. Using oseltamivir may be a new therapeutic strategy in heart failure.

The following proposed study will assess these questions by investigating objective, ecologically valid measures of pro-social cognition four weeks after different pharmacological challenges (MDMA, an entactogen and releaser of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine; psilocybin: a classical psychedelic and serotonin 2A receptor agonist, methylphenidate: an amphetamine and norepinephrine-dopamine re-uptake inhibitor) in healthy volunteers.",RECRUITING,,2023-10-24,2025-06,2025-04,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,120,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Psilocybin"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Single dose of psilocybin (15mg), orally in form of capsules"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Single dose of MDMA (100mg), orally in form of capsules"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Methylphenidate"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Single dose of methylphenidate (60mg), orally in form of capsules"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG;DRUG;DRUG,"psilocybin;3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine;methylphenidate",0
OTHER,NCT06675279,Psychometric Properties of the Turkish Version of the HANA in Migraine,The Headache Needs Assessment (HANA) Survey: Psychometric Properties of the Turkish Version in Migraine,"Migraine is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting numerous adults. Headaches are often associated with significant disruptions that can interrupt the patient's usual activities for hours. Although headaches are typically episodic, many individuals with migraine experience life restrictions due to the anticipation of future attacks and the prevalent concern that headaches will compromise their functional capabilities. Several health-related quality of life scales have been developed to assess migraine and its associated conditions. Some examples include the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Quality of Life and Migraine Scale, and the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Measure. While some of these scales have Turkish versions, others do not. Many of these instruments are designed for clinical research, offering comprehensive assessment but are disadvantaged by lengthy completion and scoring times for patients. There is a need for brief health status measures with simple scoring systems that can evaluate the overall impact of migraines on daily activities. The Headache Needs Assessment (HANA) is a seven-item questionnaire developed to assess migraine-related quality of life issues.

This study aims to validate and establish the reliability of the Turkish version of the Headache Needs Assessment for evaluating individuals with migraines. If proven valid and reliable, the Headache Needs Assessment will be a practical tool for assessing the quality of life in individuals with migraines.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The Turkish version of the Headache Needs Assessment is not valid and reliable.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The Turkish version of the Headache Needs Assessment is valid and reliable.","Migraine is a serious health problem that disrupts quality of life and ranks second among primary headaches, affecting over 10% of the general population. In Turkey, the lifetime prevalence of migraine is reported to be 16%, with rates of 10.9% in men and 21.8% in women. Migraine is characterized by episodic attacks that may include headaches accompanied by vomiting, nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia. Chronic migraine is defined as a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month for over three months, with migraine features present on at least 8 of those days. The International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for migraine require only two of four commonly seen pain features; thus, a non-throbbing, bilateral headache can still meet migraine criteria if it is moderate to severe, worsens with physical activity, and is accompanied by migraine-specific symptoms. Neck pain related to stress, which is sometimes associated with tension-type headache, is also a common feature of migraine.

Measurements play a crucial role in scientific research across various fields, including natural sciences, social sciences, and health sciences. In the biomedical sciences, many clinical conditions, psychological behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs are challenging to measure accurately. These may include disease severity, disease-related quality of life, pain perception, anxiety, and more. To quantify and assess specific attributes, researchers develop tools known as ""scales"" that consist of various components. Clinical scales are tools used in medicine to evaluate different aspects of a patient's health, including physical and mental health symptoms, functional abilities, and overall quality of life.

The Headache Needs Assessment (HANA) is designed to assess two dimensions of the chronic impact of migraine-related quality of life issues: frequency and discomfort. It comprises seven items and serves as a useful screening tool for evaluating the impact of migraine on individuals. Its two-dimensional approach to patient-reported quality of life enables individuals to weigh the influence of both the frequency and discomfort of chronic migraines on various aspects of daily life. This scale will fill a gap in the Turkish literature regarding the parameters it evaluates and will serve as a valuable tool in the field.",COMPLETED,,2024-03-01,2024-09-01,2024-09-01,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,79,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Survey-based study"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""The demographic information of individuals with migraines, along with data from the Visual Analog Scale, Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire, Headache Impact Test, Henry Ford Hospital Headache Disability Inventory, and Headache Needs Assessment, will be collected and analyzed."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER,survey-based study,1

They study hypothesis are the following:

1. participants in the intervention condition will report greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sexual contact) from baseline to 3 month follow-up compared to the control group;
2. participants will report greater reductions in drug risk behaviors (e.g., sharing injection equipment, drug use during sex) from baseline to 3 month follow-up compared to the control group;
3. participants who report more HIV prevention information, motivation, and behavioral skills will report fewer sexual risk behaviors.","The specific aims for Stage1b are: (1) to pilot test and evaluate the effectiveness of the DVD-based HIV intervention by recruiting 210 Latino offenders mandated to substance abuse treatment; and (2) to evaluate both participant and interventionist acceptability of this novel DVD intervention. Participants will be recruited from a local community agency that provides outpatient substance abuse treatment services for court-mandated individuals. Eligible participants will be self-identified Latino/Hispanic, between the ages of 18 and 49, heterosexual, and all participants will be involved with the criminal justice system. Participants will be randomized into either an intervention or a wait-list control condition. The intervention consists of one DVD-based group session facilitated by an interventionist. Sexual risk, drug use, mental health, and background information will be assessed at baseline, and again at 3 months after the intervention session. At the end of the intervention session, each participant will complete an acceptability questionnaire, and the interventionist will complete a checklist to assess treatment fidelity. It is hypothesized that both sexual risk and drug use behaviors will decrease between baseline and follow-up for the intervention group compared to the control group. The project is innovative because it will develop a DVD-based, culturally-appropriate and language specific, HIV/Hepatitis C virus prevention intervention for Latino offenders. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to produce a brief HIV/Hepatitis C virus intervention that can be implemented within the criminal justice system and targets a high risk group.

It is hypothesized that participants in the intervention condition will report significant reductions in sexual risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sexual contact) and drug risk behaviors (e.g. sharing injection equipment, drug use while having sex) from baseline to 3 - month follow-up when compared to control group. The main analysis here is to compare the proportion (or mean) of primary outcomes for those measured at 3-month (post-intervention) to those measured at baseline (pre-intervention) between the intervention and control group. The null is that there will be no differences, and alternative hypotheses would be that the intervention group will report more of a reduction in risk behaviors than control group. These hypotheses can be tested by either repeated-measures ANCOVA or regression with the robust cluster estimator obtained after controlling for intervention condition.",COMPLETED,,2014-07,2016-05,2016-05,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,201,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""DVD Intervention"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Participants will be randomly assigned, with a baseline and 3 month follow up assessments"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BEHAVIORAL,dvd intervention,1

NIH,NCT00046579,Psychosocial Determinants of Nutrient Intake in Girls,,"To better understand the determinants of nutrient intake in black and white adolescent girls and to examine the effects of nutrient intake and eating behaviors on obesity, a significant risk factor for CVD.","BACKGROUND:

Studies have documented the importance of eating behavior as a modifiable risk factor for the development of obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The burden of obesity and CVD is not equally distributed in the population; women from ethnic minority populations are particularly likely to be obese and to have higher rates of CVD and stroke than white women.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study determines the extent to which psychological and familial factors contribute to nutrient intake in black and white girls, beyond the well-established effects of ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Specifically, the aims of the project are the following: 1) to provide a detailed developmental description of eating behaviors and nutrient intake in black and white girls and to examine the ""clustering"" of certain eating behaviors (e.g., skipping meals and snacking) into eating patterns; 2) to determine the clinical significance of eating behaviors and eating patterns by examining their contribution to nutrient intake and the development of obesity; 3) to examine the role of psychological and familial factors as determinants of eating behaviors, eating patterns, nutrient intake, and obesity in black and white girls. Capitalizing upon the availability of extensive data collected prospectively among an exceptionally well-maintained cohort of 2,379 black and white females over a 12-year period (from ages 9-10 to ages 21-23), the study applies innovative analytic procedures to further the scientific understanding of the determinants of nutrient intake and eating behaviors in adolescent girls. Participants were assessed annually for ten years as part of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study (NGHS) with measurements of anthropometry, food intake, eating and weight related attitudes and behaviors and family cohesion. Parents also provided information about weight, eating, and family environment at two assessments. In a subsequent study with the same sample, structured clinical interviews were conducted to determine history of psychiatric disorders and risk factors for eating disorders.

Current face-to-face prevention approaches are of limited effectiveness, rely on extensive resources, and are at odds with adolescents' digital preferences. We will evaluate two unconventional but promising interventions delivered to 13- to 17-year-olds: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation. If effective, these digitally-delivered interventions could reach far more adolescents at far lower cost than current approaches.","Over the past two decades, suicide rates have increased nearly 35% in the U.S., with upward trends in nearly all demographic groups. Further increases have occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Despite ambitious goals for reducing suicides and significant federal and private investment, suicide rates continue to rise unabated. To date, the predominant approach to mitigating suicide risk in the U.S. is secondary prevention. Typically, these programs identify risk of recurrence among those who have already attempted suicide at least once. Although secondary prevention is crucial, the majority of deaths by suicide occur on first attempt. Thus, targeted primary prevention earlier in development is essential. Most current primary prevention programs are intensive, expensive, and delivered by highly trained mental health providers, who are in short supply. Traditional face-to-face therapy is also unavailable to many who live in underserved communities, and disliked by adolescents, who much prefer digital delivery on their devices. This high-risk, high-reward proposal addresses these limitations and needs. We use an experimental therapeutics approach to evaluate the independent and combined efficacies of two unconventional but scalable interventions: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation. These low-cost interventions, which hold strong promise but have not been used before, can reach large numbers of adolescents, with much potential to reduce prospective suicide risk. We will enroll 212 adolescents, ages 13-17 years, who show elevations on at least two prominent risk factors for suicide (e.g., self-injury, maltreatment).

Using a 2 × 2 design, adolescents will be assigned randomly to receive 30 days of treatment with:

1. tVNS to target emotion dysregulation,
2. a peer-support phone app to target social isolation,
3. tVNS + a peer-support phone app, or
4. enhanced treatment as usual with monitoring and access to resources.

Intervention effects on mechanisms (emotion dysregulation, social isolation) proximal efficacy signals (e.g., physiological reactivity, self-harm) and target outcomes (suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviors) will be evaluated immediately post-intervention and at one-year follow-up.

The type and stage of HNC, indication for radiotherapy, type of radiotherapy, total cumulative dose, and number of courses were also recorded. Unfortunately, the laboratory data were incomplete in many cases, so could not be subjected to statistical analysis. Follow-up was continued until loss to follow-up, death, or the end of 2023, whichever came first. Moreover, full written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this article. Confidentiality of the data was secured by assigning of a code for each patient record. Images were analyzed to determine the timing of development of CAS, identify significant (\&gt;50%) CAS using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria, and calculate the total plaque score (TPS) and wall thickness. The carotid vessels were divided into the common carotid artery (CCA), carotid bulb, internal carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid artery (ECA). The bulb was defined as the portion of the artery 1 cm caudally to 1 cm cranially from the point where the CCA divided into the ICA and ECA. The right and left carotid artery systems were each divided into the following five segments: proximal CCA (≥20 mm proximal to bulb), distal CCA (\&lt;20 mm proximal to bulb), carotid bulb, ICA. and ECA. Each segment was graded as follows: 0, normal or no detectable plaque; 1, plaque occupying \&lt;30% of vessel diameter; 2, plaque occupying 30%-49% of vessel diameter; 3, plaque occupying 50%-69% of vessel diameter; 4, plaque occupying 70%-99% of vessel diameter; and 5, 100% occlusion of vessel diameter by plaque. The carotid plaque score was obtained for each patient by summing the scores obtained for the five arterial segments in both carotid arteries. Wall thickness and degree of CAS were measured in the five segments of the carotid artery at baseline and during follow-up. Differences in these values were calculated. CT was performed at least twice. The initial CT scan was performed within 2 months before initiation of radiotherapy and follow-up CT was performed 1 month after completing radiotherapy. In cases with multiple follow-up CT scans, the last scan was used to evaluate post-radiation change. The 1-year follow-up CT scan was also examined. All baseline and follow-up measurements were made by a vascular surgeon who was blinded to the clinical data.",COMPLETED,,2022-01-01,2024-02-01,2023-01-01,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,907,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Radiotherapy"", ""type"": ""RADIATION"", ""description"": ""Review imaging and medical record of head and neck cancer patient who recieve radiotherpy to find out the incidence of ischemic cerebrovascular event and carotid artery stenosis.

ED is a type of inflammation in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by an increase in eosinophils. An increase in intestinal eosinophils is a finding also seen with food allergy upon exposure to the offending antigen. The presence of intestinal eosinophilia in ED would suggest an allergic mechanism may be involved in the generation of pain and other symptoms associated with ED. Endoscopy and biopsy are used to aid in the identification of ED, which often is followed by elimination diets and food challenges to identify the offending allergen. This approach is both invasive (due to endoscopy) and cumbersome (due to the complexity and restrictiveness of the elimination diet).

In this study, 60 stroke patients will be recruited and randomized into two groups. All patients will receive a similar classical rehabilitation as a basis. Patients of the control and experimental groups will receive a supplement of classical rehabilitation and robotic-assisted therapy, respectively.","INTRODUCTION

The cerebral vascular accident affects two people per thousand each year (Duncan et al. 2005). This injury is the leading cause of permanent disability in our population. The brain damage is expressed by different neurological impairments and functional disabilities. These disabilities justify intensive and sustained multidisciplinary rehabilitation to reduce neurological impairments, to improve the activities and participation of patients, and, ultimately, their quality of life (Duncan et al., 2005).

Recently appeared in rehabilitation to stimulate maximum brain plasticity robotic devices meet the actual recommendations existing in stroke's rehabilitation (Langhorne et al., 2011). Indeed, the robots allow the execution of a large number of movements whose quality is controlled. A visual interface gives the patient a feedback of its movements, and offers exercises oriented functional tasks that have meaning for him and the possibly dive into a virtual reality. All these elements justify the clinical development of robots to assist the therapists (Pignolo et al. 2009).

The therapeutic efficacy of these robots for the rehabilitation of the upper limb was evaluated especially in chronic stroke patients (\> 6 months after stroke) (Mehrholz et al., 2012). Unfortunately, few quality studies was conducted in these patients at the acute stage of rehabilitation, during which the potential of brain plasticity is the most important and the largest functional progress are observed (Stinear et al. 2012). In addition, few studies have evaluated the effect of these therapies robotic on the three fields of the ICF (Mehrholz et al., 2012). Many studies focus on impairments (e.g. muscle strength) without assessing the functional ability of the patient in activities of daily living.

OBJECTIVES

To perform a multicenter, single blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of of robotic-assisted therapy in acute stroke patients by evaluating the three fields of the ICF.

METHODS

Patients will be included in the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (Brussels, Belgique) and the center of William Lennox (Ottignies, Belgique). The patients will be randomised into two groups (control and experimental), using a stratified randomization method to ensure the equivalence of the two groups for motor neurological impairments (score of the Fugl-Meyer). This randomization will be organized independently in each centre participating in the study. The study of statistical power shows that 27 patients per group are necessary. This study of power has taken into account a statistical power desired to 99%, a minimum detectable change to 0.09 and a standard deviation of 0.08 on the upper limb kinematics of the patient (Gilliaux et al. 2014). In estimating a risk of out drop to 10%, the investigators plan to recruit 60 patients.

In each centre, in the acute phase, the patients receive daily a multidisciplinary rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy,...) more or less intensive (60 to 300 min). In the experimental group, one of these daily therapies will be devoted to the rehabilitation robot, 4 times a week for 9 weeks. The control group will benefit from conventional treatments. As such, the duration of support will be similar between the two groups. All treatments will be administered by therapists specialized in neurological rehabilitation.

Patients will be evaluated three times in the study: before the start of treatments, at the end of treatments, and 6 months after the stroke event. All assessments will be carried out by a therapist which will be not informed the group that the patient is assigned (single-blind).

PERSPECTIVES

From this study, the investigators hope to demonstrate the efficacy of robotic-assisted therapy in acute stroke patients by evaluating the three fields of the ICF.

OTHER,NCT03885479,Impact of Different Dietary IgGs on the Pathogenesis of IBD,Impact of Different Dietary IgGs on the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Identify the association between certain food IgGs (Wheat, rice, broad beans, cow milk, eggs, chicken and beef) and the immunological response in patients with IBD","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is comprised of two major disorders: ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease have distinct pathologic and clinical characteristics but their pathogenesis remains poorly understood.

In 2015, an estimated 1.3% of US adults (3 million) reported being diagnosed with IBD (either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis). This was a large increase from 1999 (0.9% or 2 million adults).The incidence and prevalence of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) appear to be lower in Asia and the Middle East , however, in some newly industrialized countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, the incidence of IBD has been rising.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by relapsing and remitting episodes of inflammation limited to the mucosal layer of the colon. It almost invariably involves the rectum and typically extends in a proximal and continuous fashion to involve other portions of the colon.

Crohn disease is characterized by transmural inflammation and by skip lesions. The transmural inflammatory nature of Crohn disease may lead to fibrosis and strictures, and to obstructive clinical presentations that are not typically seen in ulcerative colitis. The transmural inflammation more commonly results in sinus tracts, giving rise to microperforations and fistulae.

Food antigens are thought to trigger an immunologic response resulting in the development of IBD. However, specific pathogenic antigens have not been identified. While studies attempting to associate specific diets with the development of IBD have had inconsistent results, the data suggest that a ""Western"" style diet (processed, fried, and sugary foods) is associated with an increased risk of developing Crohn disease, and possibly ulcerative colitis.

To date, studies concerning food intolerance in IBD have largely focused on classic food allergies based on IgE mediated antibody responses. The levels of total or food-specific IgEs have been observed to be increased in the sera of IBD patients, and IgE-mediated food allergies are more frequent in IBD patients than in those without IBDs. Nevertheless, reactions mediated by food specific IgGs, featuring a more delayed response following exposure to a particular antigen, are also expected to contribute to adverse reactions in IBD, and food-specific IgGs help physicians identify the candidate food for elimination in IBD patients. Furthermore, IgG-mediated adverse reactions have also been reported to be involved in some cases of food hypersensitivity.

Elimination diet can help in the remission of the disease. An elimination diet involves removing a food from the diet for a period of time and seeing whether symptoms resolve during that time. In patients receiving enteral nutrition, it involves introducing one new food at a time to identify foods that precipitate IBD symptoms. Many patients can identify foods that they believe may precipitate or worsen their disease and it is reasonable for them to avoid such foods. Using an elimination diet to identify at-risk foods may decrease the possibility of a ""flare"" of IBD.",UNKNOWN,,2019-04-01,2020-03-31,2019-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,150,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""ELISA for the semi-quantitative analysis of serum food-specific IgGs against food-derived antigens"", ""type"": ""DIAGNOSTIC_TEST"", ""description"": ""An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the semi-quantitative analysis of serum food-specific IgGs against 7 food-derived antigens (Wheat, rice, beans, cow milk, eggs, chicken and beef)"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DIAGNOSTIC_TEST,elisa for the semi-quantitative analysis of serum food-specific iggs against food-derived antigens,0

The role of Laparoscopy may be of diagnostic and therapeutic value.

Methods: Between April 2017 and April 2020, 793 patients were admitted to Zagazig University Hospital's emergency surgery unit with lower GIT emergencies, including acute appendicitis, acute intestine obstruction, complicated colonic diverticulum, complicated hernias, and iatrogenic colonic perforations.","An acute lower abdomen is typically caused by peritoneal irritation caused by an abdominal organ's inflammation, rupture, or a hollow organ obstruction. Patients with severe acute lower abdominal pain either proceed to the operative room or additional investigations or diagnostic Laparoscopy (DL).

OTHER,NCT05136079,Prophylactic LYMphatic Reconstruction (LYMbR) to Prevent Lymphedema After Node Dissection for Cutaneous Malignancies,Prophylactic LYMphatic Reconstruction (LYMbR) to Prevent Lymphedema,"Background: Lymphedema following lymph node dissection is a chronic condition that can limit physical, occupational, and social participation, impact self-image, and result in financial burden. Studies have reported lymphedema incidence rates of 39% to 73% following node dissection.

Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) has been previously used to treat established lymphedema. More recently, with imaging capabilities guided by blue dye and indocyanine green dye, the possibility of prophylactic LVA has become feasible. A 2018 systematic review of 12 studies utilizing prophylactic LVA during lymphadenectomy indicated a 2/3 reduction in the risk of lymphedema. The literature yet lacks any phase III studies with stringent controls and long term follow-up.

Objectives: To assess (primary endpoint) the impact of prophylactic LVA on presence or absence of lymphedema post axillary or groin lymphadenectomy and participant quality of life. To assess (secondary endpoint) the incidence of complications related to nodal dissection.

Methods: This is a phase III RCT, block randomized for upper and lower extremities, recruiting adult patients planned for an axillary or groin node dissection as a result of cutaneous malignancy. Analysis of rates of lymphedema and quality of life reports will be done.

Significance: Lymphedema is a feared outcome of surgical cancer care. Its impact on patients' daily lives is profound. A reduction of incidence of this debilitating condition by 2/3 would have significant impact on numerous lives and could also reduce the health system resources needed for its management.","Trial Objective: To ascertain the efficacy and impact of prophylactic lymphaticovenous anastomosis for prevention of lymphedema in cutaneous malignancy patients undergoing axillary or groin node dissection as part of cancer treatment. To determine quality of life impact, if any, for patients who receive this treatment. To determine incidence of complications related to nodal dissection are reduced with LVA.

Cancer-related lymphedema (CRLE) is a complex and lifelong implication of cancer treatment. Centres have reported rates of lymphedema following axillary node dissection of 39% (53% following adjuvant radiotherapy), and exceeding 73% following groin node dissection. Lymphedema can have significant quality of life (QoL) implications. Treatment, though helpful, is often burdensome, can require a second party to accomplish, and can be financially draining. Further, lymphedema is a chronic condition that cannot be eliminated once established. Many everyday activities, including self-care, employment, and social participation, as well as self-image, can be negatively impacted.

Given the high prevalence of CRLE, there is an urgency to investigate prophylaxis where possible. Prophylactic lymphaticovenous anastomosis offers this opportunity.

Although lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) has been used for decades to treat existing lymphedema, more recently prophylactic LVA has been explored. Jørgensen et al's 2018 systematic review of 12 studies utilizing prophylactic LVA in cancer patients undergoing axilla or groin lymphadenectomy indicated a 2/3 reduction of CRLE in those treated prophylactically compared to those who did not receive prophylactic treatment.

More recently, Cakmakoglu et al reported on an immediate prophylactic approach whereby the LVA is performed at the time of nodal dissection utilizing fluorescing indocynanine green (ICG) and an operating microscope. This approach aided identification and assessment of the viability of lymphatic vessels in 96% of study cases, thereby augmenting the surgeon's ability to identify and choose the most appropriate vessels. Cakmakoglu's team performed the technique successfully on 22 patients. Of this 22, a single patient developed CRLE during the follow-up period (3 patients died of disease during the follow-up period but showed no sign of CRLE at their demise).

The outlook for LVA in combination with ICG looks promising but, to date, there has not been a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) on this prophylactic LVA technique. Thus, there is a need for robust RCTs utilizing a control group, having clearly defined outcome measures, investing in a significant follow-up period, and integrating blinded assessment in order to objectively demonstrate the impact of prophylactic LVA for patients.

Jørgensen et al's 2018 systematic review of prophylactic LVA case series and studies noted that, while the results were remarkable, the studies collected for the review did not have adequate control for bias and were quite heterogeneous in their cancer type, lymphadenectomy location, lymphedema classification, and assessment measures. QoL measures were not regularly integrated into assessment. Follow-up times varied from 6 months to 69 months with only 3 studies following for a minimum of 24 months.

Trial description:

Study participants will be comprised of patients undergoing lymphadenectomy for cutaneous malignancy. The participants will be block (axilla, groin) randomized using 2 equal groups (control/intervention) of 20 participants each. Participants assigned to the intervention arm will undergo prophylactic LVA as an addendum to their lymph node dissection. This will take place at time of lymphadenectomy surgery. Control participants will not have prophylactic LVA. Both groups will be blinded to treatment.

All participants will have limb volume measurements and photographs taken and the LYMQOL lymphedema-specific quality of life questionnaire administered at baseline (date of surgery) and at 6 month intervals for 24 months.

Evidence suggests that the first-line treatment for adults with this triple burden should be a comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention.

However, experts disagree about which diet should be recommended. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, a lower fat diet, is the de facto diet for adults with hypertension. A very low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet, a higher fat diet, is becoming the de facto diet for weight and glycemic control. In addition, a VLC diet may reduce blood pressure through weight loss and its impact on insulin (which alters renal sodium transport and leads to diuresis). Given that these two diets, DASH and very low-carbohydrate, are extremely promising options for this population, and the fact that they have never been compared in this population or any other, this comparison is strongly warranted.

The investigators propose to use an interprofessional team (with expertise in nursing, psychology, medicine, policy, nutrition, pharmacy, and behavioral interventions) to conduct a comparative effectiveness trial of two different diets for adults with this triple burden. The HERO Study (Hypertension, Diabetes, and Obesity Education Research Online) will compare the health effects of the DASH and VLC diets.

The investigators propose one aim:

Test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary comparative efficacy of the interventions. The investigators will randomize 140 adults with this triple burden to the DASH or VLC versions of the 4-month intervention.

But little data are available in clinical practice to guide the adjustment of the support. In adults, esophageal pressure (PES) has been shown to be a reliable surrogate of pleural pressure (PPL) and clinical studies suggest that PES may be useful to guide the management of mechanical ventilation. In children, the PES measurement could have similar potential benefits, but beforehand the reliability of PES to estimate PPL needs to be assessed.

Objective The primary objective of this study is to validate the reliability of PES directly monitored using a miniature catheter tip pressure transducer (Gaeltec® system) to estimate PPL, when compared to a gold standard, i.e the direct PPL measurement in situ.

Method This is a prospective single center study. Children \<18 years old, hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit, requiring invasive ventilation and with at least one chest tube will be included.

Protocol A pressure transducer will be connected to the existing chest-tube and PES (measured by Gaeltec® and feeding tube), PPL, PAW, respiratory volume and flow will be simultaneously recorded.

Expected results We expect that the PES-based methods will provide an accurate estimation of PPL. Once this tool validated, PES could be helpful to optimize mechanical ventilation in children, and further interventional trials would be warranted to evaluate if its use could allow a reduction of the ventilation support duration.",,COMPLETED,,2016-06-28,2017-10-01,2017-10-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,BASIC_SCIENCE,12,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""esophageal and pleural pressure measurement"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Esophageal pressure will be monitored by a dedicated catheter and pleural pressure will be measured into the chest tube already in place"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER,esophageal and pleural pressure measurement,1

There is evidence in both the cardiac and renal literature that suggests that maximising the dose of RAS therapy leads to improved outcomes over smaller doses of RAS therapy.

Indeed, many of the studies on which we base our care use doses which are higher than what the majority of our patients are taking. Thus patients are being systemically undertreated by therapies which have been shown to have robust reno protection. With up to 80% of patients on RASi therapy are not on maximal RASi therapy , putting them at risk of a more rapid progression and poorer outcomes and increased healthcare costs.

An important reason for this is the presence or fear around hyperkalaemia. With reports of significantly increased rate of hyperkalaemia seen following increases in prescribing of RASi therapy. These concerns have lead NICE to recommend not starting patients on RASi therapy if their potassium is \>5mmol/l, and KDOQI guidelines recommending consideration of stopping RASi therapy if serum potassium is \>5.5mmol/l.

ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are thought to confer long term renal protection through reduction of proteinuria. The reduction in glomerular pressure is a major mechanism leading to a reduction in proteinuria, and hence renal protection, however as a consequence there will also an acute fall in eGFR. Therefore, when starting/up titrating ACEi/ARB it is expected that there will be an acute fall in eGFR, which is expected to be more than compensated for due to the subsequent long term renal protection. Indeed, current NICE guidelines do not suggest any alteration in management until the drop in eGFR is \>25%.

There is a currently huge unmet need to optimise RASi therapy in those patients with hyperkalaemia.

There have been recent advances in novel therapeutics which can lower potassium in patients. One such agent is Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC).

SZC is a highly selective inorganic cation exchanger designed to entrap potassium in the intestine.

It has been shown to effective in lowering potassium in patients with heart failure, Diabetes, CKD and RASi therapy. With around a 1mmol/l fall in the serum potassium on those treated with SZC, compared to placebo.

Both medications work in different ways to lower blood sugar - one helps remove excess sugar through urine while the other helps the body use insulin better.

The study has two main goals:

To see if the combined pill controls blood sugar more effectively than either medication alone

To check if combining them reduces common side effects like weight gain and swelling that can occur with one of the medications

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:

The new combination pill

One of the standard diabetes medications alone

The other standard diabetes medication alone

All participants will take their assigned treatment daily and attend regular clinic visits for monitoring. Doctors will track blood sugar control, weight changes, and any side effects throughout the study period.

This research could lead to a simpler treatment option that combines the benefits of both medications while potentially minimizing side effects. For people with diabetes who often need multiple medications, a combined pill might make treatment easier to manage while providing better blood sugar control.","This phase III clinical trial investigates a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of two established antidiabetic medications with complementary mechanisms of action: an SGLT2 inhibitor and a thiazolidinedione (TZD). The study aims to evaluate whether combining these medications in a single tablet provides superior glycemic control compared to either medication alone in patients with type 2 diabetes who are already on metformin therapy.

The SGLT2 inhibitor component lowers blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose excretion, while the TZD component improves insulin sensitivity. Previous studies have shown that these drug classes may offer complementary benefits for metabolic control and cardiovascular risk reduction. However, the TZD component has been associated with side effects including fluid retention and weight gain in some patients. This trial will assess whether the combination can maintain the therapeutic benefits of both drugs while potentially reducing TZD-related adverse effects.

The randomized, double-blind, double-dummy design compares three treatment arms: the FDC, SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy, and TZD monotherapy. The primary endpoint is the change in HbA1c from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints include measures of safety, tolerability, and additional metabolic parameters.

Participants will undergo regular monitoring including blood tests, physical examinations, and safety assessments throughout the study period. The trial includes specific protocols for detecting and managing potential side effects, particularly those related to fluid retention.

This study addresses an important clinical question regarding optimal treatment strategies for type 2 diabetes, particularly the potential advantages of fixed-dose combinations in simplifying treatment regimens while maintaining efficacy and safety. The results may provide evidence for a new therapeutic option that combines the established benefits of these two drug classes while potentially mitigating some limitations of monotherapy approaches.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2026-09,2028-02,2028-02,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,408,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Fixed-dose combination of SGLT2 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Oral fixed-dose combination tablet containing an SGLT2 inhibitor and a thiazolidinedione, administered once daily.

The primary goal of the study will be to demonstrate an advantage for GPS in overall survival in these patient populations. The study will enroll approximately 140 patients and will be conducted at about 110 investigational sites. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to GPS or BAT stratified by whether they are in CR2 or CRp2, their cytogenetic risk at diagnosis (poor vs all other), whether they harbor minimal residual disease (MRD), and the duration of CR1 of less than one year or one year or more.

Patients on the BAT arm may be treated with 1. observation (whereby palliative management with hydroxyurea is allowed), 2. a hypomethylating agent (decitabine or azacitidine), 3. venetoclax and/or 4. low-dose ara-C.

However, there are no restrictions on prior use of any agents in the CR1 setting. Patients cannot receive GPS as an adjunct therapy to any other agents.

Patients on the GPS arm will receive 70 μg of sargramostim (GM-CSF) on Day -2 and Day 1 before each injection of GPS. The first two administrations of GM-CSF will take place at the same anatomical site as the planned administration of GPS within each treatment cycle. GPS will be administered as an immunization induction every 2 weeks for 6 administrations (Weeks 0 - 10); this will be followed by a 4-week period of no treatment.

The GLP-1 hormone is essential for glucose reduction, weight loss, cardiovascular risk reduction, and renal protection. Newly discovered mechanisms will illuminate causal links between disease genotype and phenotype, which may ultimately guide personalized therapeutic approaches for type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and other related diseases.","This clinical trial will uncover new mechanisms of inter-individual responses to endogenous and exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in Hispanics/Latinos (H/Ls) with prediabetes. The results move the management of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and relevant metabolic diseases to a more individualized approach in an understudied and at-risk population. Few options exist for prediabetes treatment, and the current pharmaceutical management of T2DM does not predict drug treatment failures, nor differences in individual treatment responses and adverse effects. A precise, genetics-based approach will provide superior therapeutic management for patients. GLP-1-based therapies reduce blood glucose, promote weight loss, decrease cardiovascular events, and improve renal function. Prior genetic studies, most done in Caucasians, identified associations between genetic variants and decreased GLP-1-induced insulin secretion, in an effort to guide individualized treatment. However, these associations do not provide a clear mechanistic relationship between genotype and phenotype. Transcriptomic analyses will uncover many of these mechanisms. Here, we propose to 1) test the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that regulate expression (eQTLs) of 11 candidate genes in a range of relevant metabolic tissues with differential GLP-1 response, 2) perform RNA sequencing before and after treatment to identify eQTLs in blood that predict response to GLP-1 therapy and develop risk-based prediction models in H/Ls, and 3) determine the effects of genetic regulation of candidate genes and newly discovered eQTLs phenome-wide in a large existing biobank, BioVU. For aims 1 and 2, responses will be measured in 300 study subjects with prediabetes recruited from an established Mexican-American cohort via the oral minimal model method, before and after GLP-1 therapy, quantifying GLP-1 hormone efficacy and GLP-1-induced pancreatic beta cell insulin release and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Procedures include serial measurements of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and GLP-1, and peripheral blood collection for RNA sequencing. Our central hypotheses are: (1) metabolic tissue-based eQTLs of GLP-1-associated genes will be associated with physiological response to endogenous and exogenous GLP-1,(2) identification of eQTLs associated with GLP-1 treatment-induced changes in whole blood will identify new gene targets, and (3) this data will lead to the creation of eQTL-based prediction models for related diseases. The study is innovative because it uses a novel combination of eQTL analysis and oral minimal model to assess GLP-1 response, examines a population highly underrepresented in pharmacogenomic studies, and utilizes novel statistical methods and applications to study gene expression. The significance of this newly acquired mechanistic information will ultimately guide precision therapeutic regimens for diabetes prevention and treatment, weight loss, cardiovascular risk reduction, and related metabolic complications in an understudied population.",RECRUITING,,2021-11-22,2026-07,2025-11,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,300,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Semaglutide"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Glucagon-like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonist"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,semaglutide,0
OTHER,NCT03444779,"Comparative Evaluation of Minimally Invasive ""tibial Tuberoplasty"" Surgical Technique Versus Conventional Open Surgery for Tibial Plateau Fractures","Comparative Evaluation of Minimally Invasive ""tibial Tuberoplasty"" Surgical Technique Versus Conventional Open Surgery for Tibial Plateau Fractures (TUBERIMPACT Study)","PMSI (French Medico-Administrative Database) data shows more than 10000 proximal tibial fractures diagnosed in 2014 and 4055 lateral tibial plateau fractures operated in 2013 in France. 50% of these surgical fractures is related to the lateral condyle and causes split/depression (Schatzker 2) or pure depression (Schatzker 3). This high rate results from the recent democratization of high-risk sports, as well as an aging population with increased risks of falling. Aside from the resulting reduced physical activity, the social and professional impact of these fractures is undeniable and represents significant costs for our health care system. A recently published prospective case series reports 28 job losses out of 41 patients treated.

The clinical outcome of these patients depends mainly on the primary stability provided by the surgical treatment, after the greatest anatomical reduction possible. Indeed, Giannoudis and al. have demonstrated that under simple X-rays, the smaller the detected step-off, the better the outcome.The aim is to allow for recovery of good joint mobility to promote rapid resumption of activity and to limit the onset of early osteoarthritis.

The classical technique used for reduction and osteosynthesis of tibial plateau fractures (open surgical technique using a bone tamp) has several pitfalls : devascularization of the bone and skin, risks of infection and functional rehabilitation difficulties with delayed recovery of weight bearing. Moreover, this technique does not allow for the simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of other possible lesions, such as meniscal injuries in particular.

Since 2011, Poitiers University Hospital is offering to its patients a new minimally invasive technique for the reduction and stabilization of tibial plateau fractures, baptized ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"". The concept derives from the divergent use of vertebral kyphoplasty, initially dedicated for spinal injuries and transposed here to the tibial plateau. This technique involves expansion of the tibial plateau through inflation of a kyphoplasty balloon, filling of the created cavity with cement (PMMA, calcium phosphate) and percutaneous screw fixation.

Orthopaedic surgeons of Poitiers University Hospital performed the first tibial tuberoplasties through a feasibility study on 36 cadaveric subjects and then transposed the technique to human. Surgeons identified major advantages such as minimal skin damage, possible treatment of posterior and multi-fragmented compressions (lifting in a single block by the balloon), reinforcement of the stability of the assembly using cement, possible use of combined arthroscopy (for concomitant meniscal injuries treatment).

This technique allows for optimization of the fracture reduction by elevating the posterior fragments with the inflatable bone tamp through an anterior approach. The reduction is made possible thanks to the specificity of the inflatable bone tamp which inflates and reduces the area of least resistance.

The aim of this innovative technique is focused on the anatomical reduction in order to restore the convexity of the tibial plateau which is similar to the balloon convexity.

The results from the first 40 patients operated since 2011 are promising and show a proportion of 70% presenting less than 5 mm step-off reduction. A larger scale multicenter randomized controlled trial is now requested to further demonstrate the superiority of the ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"" to the standard treatment.

The coordinator investigator designed this study to evaluate the quality of tibial fracture reduction offered by percutaneous ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"" versus conventional open surgery for tibial plateau fracture but also its impact on clinical outcome.",,COMPLETED,,2018-10-26,2024-11-14,2022-10-26,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,137,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Tibial Tuberoplasty"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Kyphoplasty ballon"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Open technique"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Cutaneous incision with submeniscal arthrotomy under guidance of a fluoroscope."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE;DEVICE,tibial tuberoplasty;open technique,1
FED,NCT00333879,Virtual Reality Mobility Training System for Veterans With Vision Loss,Virtual Reality Mobility Training System for Veterans With Vision Loss,"This is a two-year proof-of-concept study to evaluate a new Virtual Reality (VR) ""holographic"" sound system for use as an audiological Orientation and Mobility (O\&M) training tool","This is a two-year proof-of-concept study to evaluate a new Virtual Reality (VR) ""holographic"" sound system for use as an audiological Orientation and Mobility (O\&M) training tool. This new system avoids the limitations of other technologies (i.e., binaural recordings and existing VR sound systems) that have been employed with limited success for audiological training. Four advancements in the state-of-the-art represented by this new holographic system provide new promise for audiological O\&M training. First, unlike binaural systems, the new system allows the person to move their head in a natural fashion to localize sounds. Second, a spherical microphone array is used to record sound environments so as to retain the direction from which each ambient sound originated. When these recorded sound environments are later presented through head-tracking headphones in a VR environment, real-time software maintains the directionality of the sound so that it remains true no matter how the person moves or turns their head. Third, this new system models the actual physical acoustic structure of each person's head and ears to present sounds as they would be heard by that particular person in the recorded setting. Fourth, this system uses software algorithms to isolate specific sounds (i.e., of a moving vehicle) so that during virtual playback, these sounds can be inserted into the virtual sound field at will and in a customizable fashion to create truly unique and flexible virtual sound presentations.

There are two study hypotheses. First, when using sounds to negotiate traffic intersections, skills employed by experienced travelers in real environments will readily transfer to the proposed VR environment to the extent that audiological tasks performed in real environments are just as easily performed in the VR environment. Second, when the VR environment is enhanced to emphasize critical sound cues and eliminate distracting or confusing noises and sounds, performance by skilled travelers in the VR environment will be significantly better than in the actual environment.

The objectives are to: (1) adapt the existing spherical microphone array and digital recording software algorithms to best suit the capture of critical intersection sounds used for intersection negotiations; (2) develop software algorithms to deconstruct intersection sounds, isolating each sound for the VR construction of specific environments of varying complexity; (3) determine the level of sound detail necessary for negotiating intersections successfully; (4) expand the existing system to obtain the desired level of detail; (5) develop software to provide the ability to control the relative emphasis of a variety of sound elements being presented so as to simplify the auditory task; and (6) employ study participants to compare performance in the VR environment with outdoor performance.

Once validated, this system should be able to: (1) leverage instructor time by providing students with an effective means of practicing audiological skills on their own, (2) provide instructors with a means of introducing concepts in a graduated learning sequence that is not dependent on the happenstance availability of specific sounds and conditions found in real environments, and (3) provide audiological training for environments not located in the vicinity of the training site, but which do represent the veteran's home community.

Research will be conducted in collaboration with investigators in the Perceptual Interfaces and Reality Laboratory (PIRL) at the University of Maryland who initially conceived and developed this holographic VR sound system.

Cervical cancer is still the major health problem in the developing countries. It has been the first rank women's cancer in Thailand for many decades. Approximately 10-20% of Thai women have the high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) infections in their cervices. This will frequently lead to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) (10%), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) (0.8%), and finally, cervical cancers (0.16%) within 10-20 years. The treatment options for LSILs are either observation or ablative surgery. However, in our institute, cryotherapy, which is the one of ablative surgery, is more frequently used to comfort our women. It is not only effective but safe with only minimal side effects; watery leukorrhea for 2-4 weeks, and local cervical infection not more than 1%. Contraindication to this procedure are active cervical infection, lesion of 2 mm-larger than probe, lesion inside cervical os and suspected cervical cancer. Additionally, in developing countries such as Thailand, this treatment is safe, acceptable, feasible and effective. Patients with LSILs could also have this treatment in some rural area from the 10-days trained nurses. Fortunately, recent reports showed that cryotherapy has abilities not only in clearing LSILs but also clearing the HPV infections, its necessary cause. However, there are no randomized controlled trial compared its clearing ability between observation and cryotherapy. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial is needed to demonstrate that. Findings from this trial will contribute enormously to older women who already get infected by HPV. Aside from preventing cervical cancer in treated woman, cryotherapy could also give her relief from worrying about having a time-bomb like HPV infection in her cervix.","This will be a hospital-based, parallel, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Study subjects refer to LSIL patients, more than 30 years-old, with positive HPV testing who do not have any contraindication of performing cryotherapy. Therefore, after recruitment LSIL patients whose age more than 30 years-old, we will exclude only those who have negative HPV testing or any contraindications of performing cryotherapy. The primary outcome is HPV clearance (negative HPV testing for the baseline HPV type) at 12 months after the treatment. Subjects will be randomly allocated to be treated by cryotherapy or observation only by using block randomization with varied block size of 2, 4, and 6. The sample size of at least 25 for each arm was planned to have the power of 80% to detect 20% difference rates of HPV clearance after 12 months of treatment between the two arms, with significance level of 0.05, two-sided test.

Study population:

Biopsy-confirmed LSIL patients, age more than 30 years-old, referred to either Srinagarind Hospital's, Khon Kaen Hospital's, or Roi Et Hospital's colposcopic clinics.

Inclusion criteria:

* Baseline HPV testing is positive.
* Be able to give their informed consent to this study.

Exclusion criteria:

* Having active cervical infection
* Having lesion of 2 mm-larger than probe
* Having lesion inside cervical os
* Having suspected cervical cancer lesion

Sample and sample size:

From previous studies, HPV clearance rate after cryotherapy at 12 months is 83.9%. (Elfgren, 2002) Spontaneous HPV clearance rate in young women at 24 months is 70%. (Moscicki, 1998) However, this HPV clearance rate in women older than 34 years-old at 12 months is only 53.6%. (Clavel, 2005) Using these numbers respectively as PE and PC putting in the formula below, we can calculate our sample size in each group. The sample size will be calculated to detect the 20-40% difference between the HPV clearance rates after 12 months, at significant level of 95% and power of 80% (two-sided test), using the approach of Lachin that was reviewed in the paper of Donner.(Donner, 1984)

Required sample size at different rate of clearance

P-control P-experimental Alpha level Power N Difference 95%CI 0.50 0.70 5% 80% 103 20 6.9-33.1 0.50 0.75 5% 80% 66 25 9-41 0.50 0.80 5% 80% 45 30 11.3-48.7 0.50 0.85 5% 80% 33 35 14-56 0.50 0.90 5% 80% 25 40 17.1-62.9

The sample size of at least 25 patients in each group will be chosen because of its precision and feasibility. Such sample size can detect 40% difference of HPV clearance rate between the two groups, at 95% significant level, with the power of 80%, 95%CI of 17.1-62.9, respectively.

Instruments:

After signing on the consent form, all eligible patients will be examined by the baseline standard procedures and PCR-HPV testing for 37 HPV types. Only positive HPV testing ones will be enrolled in the trial and then randomized to receive the cryotherapy or observation. The method of block randomization, with block size varies from 2 to 6, will be used to allocate treatments.

The allocation ratio is 1:1. The allocation sequence will be generated by computer, using STATA software version 10.0.

Based on the obtained schedule, the number of sealed envelopes, which are equal to the required blocks, will be prepared and labeled. Each envelope contains the corresponding sealed allocation cards that will allocate treatments to patients.

Colposcopy and cryotherapy instruments are available in our colposcopic clinic. However, we will reimburse for all CO2-gases tanks and materials used for Pap smears and HPV testing.

The people, who prepare the randomized scheme, will not involve in the trial. The allocation schedule will be concealed to the assessor (who measure the HPV testing) until the end of trial.

Data collection and measurement:

Because of the difference between two treatments, only the assessor (who measure the HPV testing) will be blinded from the treatments.

The specimens will be sent to the assessor without patient's name or HN that can be linked to the treatment received. They will be provided only the study ID number in which only the principle investigator can link it to the treatment received.

The main outcome is HPV clearance. It is measured by the gold-standard HPV testing. This will be performed at baseline and 12 months later.

Data analysis:

There were two main parts of analysis - describing selected characteristics of the study patients and analysis for answering the research questions. The first part, selected baseline characteristics of the patients in each treatment were compared i.e. age, sex, sexual experiences, underlying diseases, etc. Comparability of the distribution of those selected characteristics based on judgment rather than statistical significant tests. In this part, proportion was use for summarizing categorical data. For continuous data, the statistics include mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median.

For the second part, the analysis was based on the group in which the study patients were randomized (intention-to-treat basis). The different rate of clearance between the two arms of the trial and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated. This will be done at 12 months after the treatment. Z-test will be used for testing if such differences are different from zero. Multiple logistic regression will be used to control effects of any important confounding factors. Absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR) and number needed to treat (NNT) will also be calculated.

The statistical analysis of this clinical trial will be performed based on intention-to-treat principle. All hypothesis tests are two-tailed at significant level of 0.05.

Recently, advances arose in the use of stem cells as treatment modalities for inherited retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

The first step, production and characterization of GMP-compliant bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) has been performed according to the ethical clearance by the institutional review board of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital Mahidol University (approval number Certificate of Approval (COA) no.

In a prior study, the investigators have conducted a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety of intravitreal autologous MSC injection in 14 patients with advanced-stage RP. After follow-up periods ranging from 1.5 to 7 years, the investigators found that this intervention appeared to be safe and potentially effective. Nevertheless, several mild and one severe adverse event were observed, although all were manageable. Beside the primary outcome, safety of the MSCs, the investigators found statistically significant improvements in the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared to baseline, although they returned to the baseline at 12 months. To minimize the unwanted effects and still maintain the benefit of the MSCs, the cell-free approach using the extracellular vesicles of MSCs is of interest.

OTHER,NCT02006979,Acute Exercise Cardioprotection From Doxorubicin,The Effects of Exercise Before Doxorubicin Chemotherapy on Cardiac Function,"In rodents, a single bout of exercise prior to injection of a chemotherapy agent used to treat breast cancer prevents or attenuates a number of markers of cardiac injury. This study will investigate whether this finding translates to human breast cancer patients. Participants scheduled to receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will be randomized to exercise or no exercise 24 hours prior to every chemotherapy treatment. The effect on cardiac function will be compared between groups noninvasively by echocardiography and electrocardiography and a venous blood draw at baseline before chemotherapy, after the first treatment and at the end of chemotherapy.","1. Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate whether performing a single bout of exercise 24 hours prior to receiving infusions of the anthracycline chemotherapy agent doxorubicin for breast cancer can prevent some of the damaging cardiac effects. Currently, doxorubicin is the most effective chemotherapy agent for breast cancer but is also the most damaging. As such, increased risk of cardiovascular disease is a growing concern in doxorubicin-treated patients. Current strategies for minimizing cardiac injury are dose reduction and discontinuation of therapy, which compromise the effectiveness of the treatment. Interventions that can minimize the cardiac injury associated with doxorubicin could reduce cancer-related and cardiovascular disease-related mortality in women diagnosed with breast cancer.
2. Hypotheses 1. Performing an acute bout of exercise within 24 hours before anthracycline infusion will decrease the acute negative change in subclinical markers of cardiotoxicity after the first anthracycline infusion seen in those who do not exercise for 72 hours prior.

2. Performing exercise within 24 hours before every infusion of anthracycline will decrease the negative change in markers of cardiac dysfunction seen at the end of chemotherapy in those who do not exercise for 72 hours prior to each infusion.

3) Justification An acute exercise bout prior to induction of a myocardial infarction in animals provides cardioprotective benefit by reducing the size of the infarct relative to control animals. Recently, acute exercise performed 24 hours before anthracycline injection in rodents has also provided a cardioprotective benefit. Oxidative stress and apoptosis of cardiomyocyte mitochondria are primary mechanisms of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. The single acute bout of exercise prevented or attenuated some of the anthracycline-induced negative effects on cardiomyocytes including oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as systolic dysfunction. There are no studies to date that have investigated the cardiac effects of an acute bout of exercise in close proximity to anthracycline infusion in humans. Aerobic exercise training is recommended throughout chemotherapy treatment, but there are no guidelines in place in terms of the timing of exercise in relation to receipt of chemotherapy infusions.

4) Objectives

1. To compare the acute effect of performing exercise (within 24 hours before the first infusion) compared to no exercise (no exercise for 72 hours prior to the first infusion) on markers of subclinical cardiotoxicity 24-48 hours after the first anthracycline infusion.
2. To compare the chronic effect of performing exercise (within 24 hours before every infusion) compared to no exercise (no exercise for 72 hours prior to every infusion) on markers of cardiotoxicity 7 to 14 days after the final anthracycline infusion 5) Research Method This study will be a two-arm randomized control trial. Twenty-four women aged 18 or older newly diagnosed with stage I-IIIA breast cancer, and scheduled to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant doxorubicin chemotherapy in cycles of 2-3 weeks will be recruited by oncologist referral and posters. Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: i) an acute bout of exercise performed ≤24 hours prior to each cycle of anthracyclines and no exercise for 48 hours post; or ii) no exercise for 72 hours prior or 48 hours post each cycle of anthracyclines.

6) Statistical Analysis The primary outcome will be global longitudinal strain measured by echocardiography. The secondary outcomes will be the NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin T cardiac biomarkers measured with an assay of blood taken via venous blood draw, echocardiography-derived left ventricular twist. The exploratory outcome measure will be treatment symptoms as reported by the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist. Cardiac outcome measures will be performed at the following time points: 1) Post diagnosis and prior to the first cycle of anthracyclines; 2) 24-48 hours after the first cycle; 3) at least one week after the last cycle of anthracyclines, but before subsequent chemotherapy treatments. The Rotterdam will be performed at baseline and within the last few days of each treatment cycle.

Baseline characteristics of the two groups will be compared with independent t-tests. Descriptive statistics and frequencies will be calculated for all continuous and categorical variables. The acute effect will be determined by the difference between time points 1) and 2). The chronic effect will be determined by the difference between time points 1) and 3). For each analysis, a linear mixed model with time as a fixed and repeated effect, group as a fixed effect, and a time by condition (2 x 2) interaction will be used.

A database of patients' information is available, including underlying diseases, signs and symptoms, medications, laboratory tests, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. The data is documented by expert cardiologists on every patient's visit.

The inclusion criteria were having a history of COVID-19 infection confirmed by PCR or suggested by HRCT findings and having been afflicted with COVID-19 at least one year ago. The exclusion criteria were having a history of documented COVID-19 infection, which occurred less than a year ago, and having a probable history of COVID-19 not confirmed by PCR or HRCT.

Patients' information before COVID-19 infection was extracted from the database, including baseline demographic data, COVID-19 vaccination history, hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia (or hyperlipidemia (HLP)), diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, CVD, and prescribed medications. Patients with incomplete data before COVID-19 or with outdated data were excluded.

We contacted the enrolled patients to get informed about their symptoms, such as dyspnea at rest, dyspnea on exertion (DOE), orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) 21, chest pain (CP) 22, fatigue 23, and palpitations 24. Patients were asked to rate their dyspnea at rest from 0 to 10, according to the 10-category ratio. A score of zero means no breathing discomfort, and ten indicates the most severe dyspnea. A score between 1 to 4 was considered mild, 5 to 6 moderate, and 7 to 10 severe. We also used functional class 1 to 4 to assess their dyspnea. Functional class 1 means no limitations in daily activities, functional class 2 means mild exertional dyspnea, functional class 3 indicates moderate dyspnea with daily activities, and functional class 4 figures dyspnea at rest 25. Chest pain was defined, based on the American heart association 2021, as ""noncardiac,"" ""possible cardiac,"" and ""cardiac"" 22.

MACE is defined as myocardial infarction (MI), admission due to heart failure (HF), stroke, cardiac death, and revascularization procedures, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 26.

HTN is defined as clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg in repeated assessment 27. DM is diagnosed based on the American diabetes association (ADA) 2020 guidelines 28. Dyslipidemia is defined as abnormalities in TG, LDL, or HDL cholesterol. A TG level of more than 150 mg/dL is considered abnormal. HDL less than 40 mg/dL, LDL more than 100mg/dL, or is defined as dyslipidemia 29. Current smokers are defined as those who have smoked ≥100 cigarettes and smoked during the 30 days preceding the study. Former smokers have stopped smoking more than 30 days before the research 30.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows ver. 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). We described continuous variables by mean ±standard deviation. Categorical variables were described by frequency and percentage. We used repeated measure ANOVA and paired-sample t-test for normal distribution variables and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for repeated categorical variables. Pearson's chi-squared test and Kruskal-Wallis test are applied to categorical data.

The current treatment approaches focus on reducing symptoms, but they can be retriggered. This project aims to shift the focus of MdDS treatment to permanently eliminating the symptom trigger while also minimizing symptoms.","Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS) is an under-recognized but nevertheless common balance disorder, primarily manifested by constant self-motion sensations consisting of rocking/swaying or gravitational pull of the body, which are accompanied by fatigue, migraine, hypersensitivity to light/noise/crowds, visually induced dizziness, and cognitive dysfunctions. As the name implies (""disembarkation sickness""), in most cases MdDS occurs after exposure to prolonged passive motion, specified as motion-triggered (MT) MdDS. However, the symptoms of MdDS can also occur without a motion trigger, termed as spontaneous MdDS. MdDS is debilitating and entails various mental health issues, such as suicidal thoughts, depression, and anxiety. Treatments for this disorder are still limited, as the specific underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. Recently, the team developed the first treatment method that can safely and effectively ease MdDS symptoms in the majority of patients via readaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The hypothesis underlying this treatment is that MdDS is caused by maladaptation of the functional component of the VOR called velocity storage, whose readaptation can be stimulated by exposure to whole-field visual motion coupled with head tilts. Over the past several years, more than 500 patients from around the world have been treated with this method. The success rate immediately after this treatment is 75% for MT MdDS, but some patients report return of symptoms after subsequent flights or prolonged car rides. Thus, the effectiveness of the current MdDS treatment protocol can depend on a serious practical limitation of needing to permanently avoid transportation. Building on the previous hypothesis of velocity storage maladaptation, the study team currently hypothesizes that another method, based on the reduction (habituation) of the velocity storage, can also resolve MdDS symptoms. Velocity storage can be greatly habituated within 4-5 days using a protocol previously developed in the study team's laboratory to reduce susceptibility to motion sickness. Preliminary data support the application of this protocol to MdDS. Moreover, since animal-based research suggests that velocity storage habituation is permanently retained, the study team further hypothesizes that this new treatment method yields robust long-term outcomes. In this project, 50 MT MdDS patients with otherwise normal vestibular and neurological functions will be randomly assigned into two groups, one to be treated by velocity storage habituation and the other by readaptation. Patients will be followed up for 6 months. Based on the preliminary data, the study team expects both groups to yield similar initial success rates for symptom improvement. However, the study team expects the group undergoing the habituation protocol to better retain the initial treatment impact in the long term. This project will significantly impact the MdDS treatment practice. The current approach focuses on reducing symptoms, but they can be retriggered by another prolonged exposure to passive motion. The habituation approach on the other hand focuses on permanently minimizing the symptom trigger while also minimizing symptoms.

OTHER,NCT06885879,Impact of Radiotherapy on ctDNA in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Impact of Radiotherapy on the Dynamic Changes of Circulating Cell-free DNA in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Radiotherapy is increasingly being used in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a standalone treatment, or in combination with systemic therapy. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) causes cell death directly (via double-stranded breaks) and indirectly (via vascular bed damage or promotion of antitumour immunity). Unfortunately, the effect of cell death is not immediate and takes time. As a result, the typical arterial phase hyperenhancement on imaging may persist up to 12 months after radiotherapy, and it is not necessarily suggestive of presence of viable tumours. Therefore, there is no consensus on ideal timing of response assessment following radiotherapy to HCC. Therefore, a blood-based biomarker which can be done frequently and monitored dynamically, could be preferred for response assessment after radiotherapy. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging and promising biomarker in cancer management, which has been shown useful in cancer screening, guiding treatment, and informing prognosis. Currently, most of the clinical applications of ctDNA revolve around either the presence of ctDNA, or the genomic changes associated with these molecules. Biological properties of ctDNA such as fragment length, jaggedness of fragments, or epigenetic changes may provide additional information related to the tumour characteristics and its sensitivity to anti-cancer treatments. These biological properties of ctDNA are relatively unexplored in the context of radiotherapy. It is unknown whether these properties can be utilized for monitoring treatment response. We therefore propose to study the biological properties of ctDNA in relation to HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy.",,RECRUITING,,2025-04-08,2028-07-31,2027-07-31,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,15,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Temporal change of fragmentomics of Circulating tumour DNA undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy investigation"", ""type"": ""RADIATION"", ""description"": ""Patients will have blood taking for Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) (20cc each) at Week 0 (before radiotherapy), Week 1 (during radiotherapy), Week 2 (after radiotherapy), Week 12 and Week 24.\n\nRadiological assessment will be performed before radiotherapy, Week 12 (approximately 3 months post treatment) and Week 24-26 (approximately 6 months post treatment)."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",RADIATION,temporal change of fragmentomics of circulating tumour dna undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy investigation,0

ICH is a dynamic process with three phases: initial hemorrhage, followed by hematoma expansion and perihematoma edema formation. Hematoma volume is correlated with disease progression and outcome. Contemporary evidence proposes that elevated blood pressure is associated with hematoma expansion while more than 90% of patients with ICH present with acute hypertension. Uncontrolled blood pressure is a leading cause of ICH and it seems also to be a factor of poorer outcomes. Therefore, rapid reduction and control of blood pressure might ease disease progression and improve the outcome. Clevidipine (Cleviprex®), an ultrashort-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, with its rapid onset and short duration might be more effective than conventional antihypertensives to achieve rapid blood pressure control in patients with acute ICH.","After admission to the ICU the patients presenting with primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are evaluated for enrollment. If systolic blood pressure (SBP) is higher than 160 mmHg or SBP \<160 mmHg under intravenous antihypertensive drug (e.g. Urapidil), started less than 3 h before randomization, the patient will be randomized in one of the two study groups and intravenous therapy with Clevidipine (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®) will start immediately. Data of systemic haemodynamics will be collected continuously by online monitoring, starting at baseline and ending after 24h (study data measurements). In particular, all blood pressure measurements are extracted via an arterial line, which is placed as standard of care in these patients. If the target values are not attained within 30 minutes, the investigators can add or switch to alternative antihypertensive drugs of their choice. 24h after initiation of Clevidipine (Cleviprex®) or Urapidil (Ebrantil®), all patients receive Nicardipine (Cardene®) (standard care in daily clinical routine) for another 24h followed by orally administered antihypertensive medication.

Heart SHOCK-NORDOB Study","Cardiogenic shock is a frequent cause of admission and death in the intensive care unit.

Mortality is about 50%. Once the etiologic treatment has been done, for instance coronary revascularization, management of the shock state is the cornerstone of the treatment. Norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor therapy because of its minor effect on heart rhythm. Morever norepinephrine is a inotrope. In a previous study, we demonstrated that increasing the norepinephrine dose increases cardiac index, cardiac power index, SVO2 and tissue perfusion without acceleration of heart rate. Nevertheless, dobutamine remains the first-line inotropic treatment. Dobutamine has a positive chronotropic effect that might cause higher myocardial oxygen consumption. As a result, combination of vasopressor / inotrope is still controversial.

SAIT301 is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha chain of extracellular domain of c-MET. Binding of SAIT301 to c-MET blocks HGF binding and inhibits HGF-mediated signaling. Furthermore, SAIT301 also induces efficient c-MET internalization from the cell surface and subsequent degradation, resulting in inhibition of growth of the c-MET addicted cancer cells.

The sponsor decided to enroll subjects with tumors that express c-MET (by immunohistochemistry \[IHC\]) for this study, as the subjects with no c-MET expression are unlikely to benefit from SAIT301 treatment.

Stage 1 of this Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and anti-tumor activity of SAIT301 administered as a single IV infusion in 21 day cycles, for up to 4 cycles. Subjects without evidence of tumor progression after 4 cycles will be eligible to continue on SAIT301 treatment if there is no evidence of tumor progression for a further 4 cycles (Cycles 5 to 8). Biomarkers related to SAIT301 and/or tumor response will also be evaluated.Stage 2 will further evaluate the safety and PK profile of SAIT301 in select types of cancers. Dosing frequency may be adjusted based on the PK profile obtained during Stage 1.","The primary objectives of the study are as follows:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAIT301.
* To determine the MTD of SAIT301 and the dose level of SAIT301 where dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in subjects with advanced solid tumors or define recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) as an alternative to establishing the MTD.

Methodology: This first in man study will consist of 2 stages. Stage 1 will be a dose escalation study with a 3 + 3 design and will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK profile, biomarkers, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ascending doses of SAIT301 in subjects with c-MET + advanced solid tumors and define the MTD (or recommended Phase II dose \[RP2D\]) of SAIT301. If the PK trough levels exceed the minimum acceptable trough level for SAIT301 (25 μg/mL), the Safety Review Committee (SRC) may elect to terminate further dose escalation and declare a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule as an alternative to establishing the MTD. In Stage 2 the MTD (or RP2D) defined in Stage 1 will be administered to additional subjects with selected diagnoses, 15 subjects per selected diagnosis, to further evaluate the safety and PK profile, and any evidence of anti tumor activity of SAIT301 in these populations. The tumor types to be included in Stage 2 will be defined in a protocol amendment at a time close to study execution based on information available at that time.

The treatment period will consist of 21-day cycles. On Day 1 of each cycle, SAIT301 will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion.

For dose level 1, the first subject will receive an IV infusion of SAIT301 on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will be followed for 21 days (Cycle 1).

If the first subject at dose level 1 experiences a DLT during Cycle 1, 1 additional subject will be enrolled and will receive dose level 1, which is 50% of dose level 1. If this subject at dose level -1 does not experience a DLT during Cycle 1, 2 more subjects will be enrolled at dose level -1.

If the first subject at dose level 1 does not experience a DLT during Cycle 1, the second and third subjects will receive SAIT301 at dose level 1 and will be followed for 21 days (Cycle 1). At the discretion of the SRC, if the first 3 subjects at dose level 1 do not experience a DLT during Cycle 1, dose level 2 may be administered in the next cohort. If one of these subjects experiences a DLT, the cohort will be expanded and evaluated as described below.

For dose level 2 and each subsequent dose level, 3 subjects will receive SAIT301 on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and will be followed for 21 days (Cycle 1). If none of the 3 subjects experience a DLT, the next dose level can be administered in the next cohort. If 1 or more of the first 3 subjects experience a DLT, 3 more subjects will receive the same dose level. Dose escalation will continue until at least 2 subjects in a cohort of 3 to 6 subjects experience a DLT (i.e., ≥33% of subjects with a DLT at that dose level). Considering the possibility of relatively low efficacy, each subjects of dose level 1 and 2 can be administered with higher dose level after their first administration. This individual dose escalation can be determined by Investigators when safety data of the higher dose level are available.

For both Stage 1 and 2, subjects will continue to receive the assigned dose level of SAIT301 until unacceptable toxicity, documented progression of disease, another criterion for discontinuation is met, or until 4 cycles have been completed.

Subjects without evidence of tumor progression after 4 cycles may continue on SAIT301 treatment if there is no evidence of tumor progression for a further 4 cycles (Cycles 5 to 8). Subjects without evidence of tumor progression at the completion of Cycle 8 will be eligible for a follow-on protocol.

Device principle of operation is based on the use of weak electromagnetic radiation, continuously induced by high-voltage pulses on the launcher of a pulsed electromagnetic field electrodes and causing noise in the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The study included 236 patients who met all of the specified criteria: male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years with a coronavirus infection COVID-19 established diagnosis after specific testing, with a course of moderate disease, who do not require mechanical ventilation at the time of enrollment in the study. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus had to be confirmed by PCR (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab). Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Results were statistically evaluated for 222 patients due to death and exclusion from the clinical study of 14 patients.

Patients of the test group were exposed to the ""TOR"" device for at least 5 (five) consecutive days for at least 4 hours daily in the 15 + 15 mode (15 minutes exposure + 15 minutes break) in combination with standard therapy. Patients in the placebo group were exposed to the switched off ""TOR"" device in combination with standard therapy. The control group received standard therapy. Standard therapy was prescribed in accordance with the recommended treatment regimens presented in the current version of the Temporary guidelines of the Ministry of Health of Russia ""Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) No. 9 dated 26.10. 2020)"". The study had the periods of screening (day 1, visit 0 - V0), treatment (days 2-6, visits 1-5 - V1-V5), discharge (day 7-14, visit 6 - V6), follow-up (day 26 -30, visit 7 - V7).

As a result of the clinical trial, it was established: ""The device of non-invasive electromagnetic therapy ""TOR"" is safe when used as directed; effective as an adjuvant in combination with standard COVID-19 treatments to accelerate the elimination of the SARS-COV-2 virus from the nasopharynx.","This is a research work with the participation of patients to study the effect of low-power electromagnetic radiation with a selected spectrum on infected cells and the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself.

In the course of work with wave emitters Research center of JSC ""Concern GRANIT"" conducted research in the field of the body's response to various wave frequencies and their combinations. In February 2020, the Concern's specialists, based on open information, created a computer model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19).

After creating the simulation, work was carried out to isolate the spectrum of the wave emanating from the COVID-19 virus colony and infected cells.

The resulting spectrum was modified for the purpose of noise pollution, and as a result the virus should lose activity and the standard line of behavior, which in turn should lead to a pause in its spread and enable the human immune system to cope with the infection on its own.

Based on these assumptions, the prepared wave spectrum was recorded into the ""TOR"" device emitter, acting with an electromagnetic field with an intensity not exceeding that of a household microwave oven.

The resulting spectrum is directed by the ""TOR"" device to human tissues affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in order to disrupt its activity.

Thus, investigators are talking about a method aimed to changing the SARS-CoV-2 virus behavior, both outside a healthy cell and inside an infected one.

The main task of this method is to bring low-power electromagnetic radiation with a selected spectrum as close as possible to infected cells and the virus itself.

The safety of the ""TOR"" device is confirmed by the Institute of the Federal State Budgetary Institution ""ALL-RUSSIAN RESEARCH AND TESTING INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY"" of Roszdravnadzor (permission to conduct tests No. 876/2020 dated 10.12.2020 was issued by Roszdravnadzor).

The disorder of social interaction has often been described as resulting from poor emotion recognition, or a bad perception of biological motion. However, the results of studies on these issues are very divergent. The PDD also been described as a disorder of emotion regulation, but few studies address the emotional feelings of individuals with ASD and their neuropsychological implications. Many studies analyzing the effect of emotions induced - or felt - in healthy subjects. The effect of emotion on cognitive or attentional process is often called ""emotional effect of interference."" As has already been demonstrated, an emotion (eg induced by music or film) results in a change in visual perception of the environment strategies. These non-conscious mechanisms promote interactive synchrony with the surrounding world, especially during social interactions. We then assumed that the alteration of these perceptual-emotional regulation processes in PDD contribute to disorders of social interactions. In the absence of sufficient data in the literature, we wish to establish an exploratory study using the Eye-tracking, to objectify the links between emotional and perceptual processing in PDD.

Objectives: The main objective is to study the effect of induced emotion in the children with ASD on his visual exploration strategies. We assume that the direction of gaze to photographs of different emotional valences in individuals with ASD is not changed by the emotional state in which they are located.

Very little is known about the factors associated with surgical failure. Studies have identified a variety of risk factors: younger age, high body mass index and advanced preoperative prolapse (grade III-IV) have been associated with an increased risk of reoperation in some studies. According to some studies patients had poorer anatomical outcome after traditional repairs but were able to enjoy the same quality of life as after transvaginal mesh surgery or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the efficacy of these three procedures in a randomized controlled trial.","Pelvic organ prolapse, POP, is a common health problem affecting up to 40% of women. The lifetime likelihood of undergoing at least one incident of pelvic organ prolapse surgery has been estimated at approximately 13%. The prevalence of reoperation after primary pelvic reconstructive surgery is high at around 30%, while some studies report the figure as up to 58%. In the early 1990s the perception of pelvic floor defects and urinary incontinence in women started to change significantly. The diagnostics and management of these defects became an independent uro-gynecological sub-specialization within gynaecology and obstetrics, and it has been included among 4 basic sub-specializations recognized by the European Board and College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Surgical treatment is indicated in women with symptomatic POP when conservative management has failed or has been declined. There is no indication for repair of asymptomatic POP as an isolated procedure where surgical correction is of uncertain benefit and adds peri- and post-operative risks. The objective of our treatment should always aim to restore quality of life and comfort. Very little is known about the factors associated with surgical failure. Studies have identified a variety of risk factors: younger age, high body mass index and advanced preoperative prolapse (grade III-IV) have been associated with an increased risk of reoperation in some studies, while other studies did not prove these hypotheses. One factor which significantly influences the result of the pelvic organ surgery is the presence of pelvic floor injury. Injury of the musculus levator ani mainly affects the results of traditional vaginal wall repair, with 60% risk of recurrence. In the last few years, in an attempt to reduce recurrence and improve the outcome of reconstructive surgery in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse, surgeons have started to use transvaginally introduced prosthetic material (mesh). This type of surgery significantly increases the efficacy of the procedure (anatomic cure rate over 90%), but its use is associated with a risk of some complications (vaginal erosions and potential consecutive infections, granulomas, dyspareunia, vesico-vaginal fistulas, chronic pain) thereby potentially reducing patient quality of life and leading to additional surgery. If the mesh is introduced during sacrocolpopexy and the vaginal wall is not open, there is a significant decrease of mesh-related complications. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is considered the gold standard for the management of apical prolapse with high long-term efficacy. According to some studies patients had poorer anatomical outcome after traditional repairs but were able to enjoy the same quality of life as after transvaginal mesh surgery or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. Therefore the investigators plan to assess the efficacy in a randomized trial of three different surgical methods (the Amreich-Richter procedure, transvaginal mesh and laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy) in patients with high risk of recurrence; i.e. patients with advanced pelvic organ prolapse (at least stage III) and proved injury of pelvic floor muscles.

Aims of the study: To evaluate on the basis of a prospective randomized trial the clinical efficacy of three different surgical procedures (the Amreich-Richter procedure, transvaginal mesh and laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy) in women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse and proved pelvic floor muscle injury

All patients will undergo complete urogynecological investigation before the procedure (history, clinical examination, assessment of pelvic organ prolapse using the POPQ system, examination of the levator resting tone and contraction (Oxford scale),where appropriate urodynamics according to ICS recommendation and ultrasound examination), and they will fill in standardized international questionnaires (ICIQ-UI SF, PISQ 12, UDI_POPDI-CRADI, POP-SF). Ultrasound examinations will be performed as a combined examination using a convex probe, from abdominal and perineal approaches, and sectoral vaginal probe from the introital approach. Investigation will be preserved mainly in digital form and partly on videotapes. Acquired data from 4D imagery will be preserved in the form of data set and processed with appropriate software. Ultrasound examination will assess standards parameters describing position of the urethrovesical junction, bladder descent, uterus descent, posterior vaginal wall descent (rectocele, enterocele). Using 3D/4D ultrasound examination the status of the pelvic floor will be evaluated (presence of avulsion of puborectalis muscle, abnormal genital hiatus distension). Women will be randomized into three groups: 1. Group - Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy 2. Group - Transvaginal mesh procedure 3. Group - Amreich-Richter procedure (traditional vaginal wall repair with apical fixation to sacrospinous ligament.

All surgical procedures will be performed under general, spinal or epidural anesthesia where indicated, and antibiotic prophylaxis will be used. Surgery will be provided in standardized steps, see arm descriptions.

In an early postoperative check-up 2-3 weeks after surgery evaluation of post-operative pain will be performed and late post-operative complication such as de novo constipation, urinary retention, infections analyzed. The next post-operative complete examination is planned for 3 months after surgery (the same examination as before the procedure including clinical exam, ultrasound the QoL (ICIQ- SF, POP-SF, PISQ 12, UDI_POPDI-CRADI, TS-VAS). The next visits will be provided one year and two years after surgery, and the procedure will be the same as at the 3-month check-up. In addition to pre-operative ultrasound examination the position of the mesh will be monitored. All patients in this study will have a minimum one year follow-up and, whenever possible, a two year follow-up. Postoperative follow-up will be terminated if the result of surgery is evaluated as a failure, and in these cases reoperation will be offered.

This is more than the combined total for the next three common cancers. The most important factor that determines patient survival is the stage of disease at presentation. Surgical resection is the best chance of cure. However, patients who undergo lung resection with curative intent have a significant incidence of a second lung cancer at 2% per year and a recurrence rate of 38% at 5 years. The current follow-up of these patients relies on periodic physical examination and chest radiography(CXR). However, CXR is insensitive in the detection of lung nodules when compared to standard Computed Tomography of the thorax (SDCT). Computed Tomography detects smaller lung nodules than CXR however, the radiation dose from a SDCT is roughly equivalent to 20 CXR examinations. Screening studies using Low Dose CT of the Thorax (LDCT) in subjects at high risk for lung cancer have demonstrated that LDCT detects three times as many nodules as CXR and four times as many primary lung cancers at one-third the dose of SDCT. Phantom and clinical work with LDCT performed at UHN/MSH suggests that a further reduction in radiation dose (Minimum Dose CT -MnDCT) is possible for nodule detection. Minimum dose CT is performed at a dose one sixth of a SDCT.In addition, if MnDCT is confirmed to be a more sensitive nodule detection technique, it could be used to

It has also been related to cardiovascular disease.

The objective of this trial is to evaluate the clinical and metabolic efficacy of metformin plus life style modifications in women with polycystic ovary syndrome compared with life style modifications and placebo","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and heterogeneous disorder of women in reproductive age. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. Several studies in diverse populations estimate it's prevalence at 5-10%. Women present, in a high percentage of cases, with obesity, hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities and infertility. Although the exact physiopathology of PCOS remains unknown, several studies tend to point to insulinoresistance (IR) as the cause of the syndrome. IR is present in 60 to 70% of patients independently of obesity. Compensatory hyperinsulinism has a pivotal role in the physiopathogenesis of PCOS. In vitro, insulin stimulates androgen synthesis in thecal cells and decrease sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis in the liver, increasing free androgen availability.

Due to the high prevalence of IR, PCOS shares components of metabolic syndrome: abdominal obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational and type 2 diabetes, abnormalities in lipid profile, blood hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and probably cardiovascular disease.

In the past, PCOS treatment was focus on ovulation induction for infertility, oral contraceptives for irregular bleeding, and androgens antagonists for hirsutism or acne. In later years insulin sensitizing agents have been used to reduce hyperinsulinemia, improve ovary function and associated metabolic abnormalities. Metformin (MTF), a biguanide, usually used in obese patients with type 2 diabetes,inhibits glucose hepatic production,decreases insulin secretion and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity.

Some studies have reported an improvement in insulin sensitivity associated with reduction of hyperandrogenism and improvements in reproductive abnormalities with MTF. On the other hand, other authors failed to observe those changes. However, an off label indication for it usage in PCOS for FDA and the lack of large controlled trials, MTF indication to treat PCOS has grown dramatically in later years.

In obese women with PCOS, weight loss effectively ameliorates hyperandrogenism and metabolic disorders by improving insulin resistance.

Some trials have suggested that those effects could be improved with insulin sensitizing agents without changes in body weigh.

Immediately following the injury, patients will be randomly assigned to use the PTSD Coach app, or to the treatment as usual condition.","Traumatic injury is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S. for young people, and a source of long-term morbidity in all ages. A majority of trauma patients report chronic pain (CP) and disability at 4-months (30%- 79%) and 12-months (63%) post-injury. Maladaptive psychological processes have a stronger association with the transition to CP than does injury severity. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (e.g., intrusions, avoidance and hyperarousal) occur in up to 22% of post-injury patients and herald the transition from acute to CP. Although psychological interventions can modify PTSD symptoms, and reduce CP, it is unknown if early intervention to prevent PTSD symptoms can prevent post-injury CP altogether.

According to published guidelines, their management often requires close CT follow up, PET CT and invasive procedures to obtain a definite histology. In this context, innovative endoscopic techniques refered as navigational bronchoscopy have proved to be efficient, for the localization and sampling of peripheral lung nodules. However, these techniques are unable to differentiate malignant lesions from benign ones, in-vivo, in real time. Confocal endo-microscopy (CELLVIZIO) of the distal lung - also refered as distal lung probe based confocal laser endo-microscopy or alveolar lung endo-microscopy - allows in-vivo imaging of the distal lung structures in real time.

This prospective trial we will assess confocal endoscopy as a tool to localize the peripheral lung nodules and to differentiate benign from tumoral lesions.

Objective(s)

1. To demonstrate that confocal endo-microscopy is not inferior to navigational endoscopy for the localisation of peripheral lung nodule
2. To demonstrate that confocal endoscopy can differentiate benign from malignant tumors

Experimental design:

Multicentric prospective controlled trial, conducted in three academic centers, specialized in interventional bronchoscopy, equipped with both navigational bronchoscopy and probe based confocal endo-microscopy.

Subjects with peripheral lung nodule requiring navigational bronchoscopy will be explored using both Confocal endoscopy AND navigational bronchoscopy. Confocal probe will be inserted in the same catheter as used for the navigational bronchoscopy and confocal images will be recorded before sampling. An ancillary study using topical methylene blue as in situ will be conducted at the Rouen University Center.

An ancillary protocol includes the use of in situ methylene blue deposition and 660 confocal endo-microscopy analysis.","Main assessment criteria:

1. number of lesions localized by confocal endoscopy compared to navigational bronchoscopy
2. Positive and negative predictive values of confocal signs before and after IV fluorophore injection for the diagnosis of cancer.

According to this criteria, the confocal imaging procedure will be considered as valid if the number of lesions localized by confocal is not inferior to 90 % of those localized by navigational bronchoscopy. Therefore, probe based confocal laser endo-microscopy will prove valid if it can recognize at least 70 subjects out of the 78 / 120 subjects for which the navigational bronchoscopy is forecasted to localize the peripheral lesion (Cohen concordance Kappa value of 0,74 between confocal and navigational bronchoscopy).

A BCC diagnosis is commonly establish by means of an invasive punch biopsy (golden standard). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a safe non-invasive diagnostic modality which may replace biopsy if an OCT assessor is able to establish a high confidence BCC diagnosis. Hence, for clinical implementation of OCT, diagnostic certainty should be as high as possible. Artificial intelligence in the form of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) may improve the diagnostic certainty of newly trained OCT assessors by highlighting suspicious areas on OCT scans and by providing diagnostic suggestions (classification). This study will evaluate the effect of a CDSS on the diagnostic certainty and accuracy of OCT assessors.","In this diagnostic case control design, OCT assessors will retrospectively evaluate OCT scans of equivocal BCC lesions twice (once with, and once without the help of the CDSS).

The three methods the investigators are studying are: 1) participant become active on her/his own; educational material will be provided; 2) working with a programmed health coach over the phone via text messages; and 3) using digital voice assist to help participant become more active. The digital voice assist will be delivered via Amazon Alexa on Echo speaker (it is the famous intelligent voice that you see in superball commercial by Alec Baldwin). This study is funded by the State of Maryland.,"If the participant agree to be in this study, the investigators will ask the participant to do the following things:

The participant will be asked questions about his/her physical activity (walking, running or other exercise) to determine if he/she are eligible to participate. If the participant is eligible and interested in participating, the investigators will ask hi/her to read and sign the consent form.

After that, the investigators will randomly assign the participant to a research group (this method would be similar to drawing numbers from a hat). The result will determine which group the participant will belong to. The study would have three different groups:

1. Group one will be self-motivated to be physically active (control group)
2. The second group will receive smart daily text messages only (text group);
3. The last group would have the Amazon Echo smart device installed in participants' homes and they will interact with a digital voice assist that will help them be active (Alexa group).

Methods: As a result of the power analysis (G-Power), 36 participants are planned to be included in this study Block randomization will be used to divide participants into 2 groups, each with at least 18 participants: Group 1 (NE Group) and Group 2 (DT Group) (Randomizer.org). NE (Neuromuscular Exercise) group will participate in a 12-week exercise program consisting of sensorimotor system training, postural stability and control, global and local joint stabilization, balance training, muscle strength, breathing, and functional movement patterns.DT (Dance Therapy) Group will participate in 12-week dance training by a dance instructor. In dance therapy practices, simple and selected basic movements are appropriate to the level of the participants. Data will be collected using the Berg Balance Scale,30-second-Sit-to-Stand Test, Manual Muscle Testing, goniometer measurement and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia.

Practice Implications: This current study will contribute to the understanding of how neuromuscular exercises and dance therapy affect physical function and kinesiophobia in geriatrics.","Human aging is a complex and individual process that occurs in biological, psychological, and social areas. The metabolic and physicochemical characteristics of cells gradually change with age, a process known as biological aging. This results in cellular self-regulation, regeneration, and structural alterations as well as the degeneration of healthy tissues and organs.

Physical performance impairments are linked to a wide range of negative health consequences, including osteoporosis, falls, and fractures, and are one of the most important health problems in geriatrics. Proprioceptive perception is significantly related to postural stability. Musculoskeletal system disorders (in physiological, neurological, kinesthetic, auditory, vestibular proprioception, and cognitive systems) cause balance problems, which may lead to an increase in the frequency of falls in the elderly.

Dance therapy is a physical and mental activity in which the body moves purposefully and rhythmically to music. Regardless of its type, dance brings physical, cognitive and spiritual goals. It includes physical goals such as effective and dynamic body mechanics, movement awareness and control, flexibility, strength, coordination, endurance and thus expanding the body's movement capacity.

Although the effects of dance therapy on strength, flexibility, stress, depression, quality of life, and sleep quality in geriatric patients have been investigated in the Turkish literature, no studies comparing dance therapy with any physical exercise program have been found. It is thought that this study will shed light on the literature in the mentioned field.

The aim of this study is to compare neuromuscular exercises and danceTherapy on physical performance and kinesiophobia results in geriatrics.

Methods:

Participants:

Volunteer individuals who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and are first and second-year students of Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University 60+ Renewal University will participate in the study. Detailed information about the study will be given to each participant who wishes to participate in the study, and their written and verbal consent will be obtained.

According to the power analysis made with the G-power program, it was found that 80% power can be obtained with 95% confidence when at least 30 people are included in the study. While calculating the sample size, timed get-up and walk test results \[Group 1: 7.81 (standard deviation: 0.91), Group 2: 9.31 (standard deviation: 1.24)\] were taken as a basis and the effect size was calculated as = 1.379. The risk of case loss was taken into account by taking a reserve rate of 20%, and it was planned to include 36 participants. The cases will be divided into 2 groups by block randomization using the internet program, consisting of at least 18 individuals: Group 1 \[NE group\] and Group 2 \[AE group\] (Randomizer.org).

Study Protocol:

The study will be divided into two parallel groups: The Neuromuscular Exercise group and the Dance Therapy group. Both groups will participate in exercise programs for 12 weeks.

Evaluations will be administered before and after exercise programs. Data will be collected using the Berg Balance Scale,30-second-Sit-to-Stand Test, Manual Muscle Testing, goniometer measurement, and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia.

Training and Exercise Applications:

A Neuromuscular exercise program consisting of sensorimotor system training, postural stability and control, global and local joint stabilization, balance training, muscle strength, breathing, and functional movement patterns will be created for the participants in Group 1. Exercises will start with breathing and a 10-minute warm-up period, static and dynamic proprioception, kinesthesia training (weighting on the extremities, balance, walking, open kinetic chain, closed kinetic chain exercises), postural control exercises, Frenkel coordination exercises, balance exercises (balance ball). and with a balance board), muscle strength (calisthenic exercises, therabat exercises), plyometric exercises, and core stabilization exercises will be applied progressively over the weeks and will end with a 10-minute cooling period including flexibility and relaxation exercises.

2. Participants in Group 2 will be given dance training by a dance instructor in the gym for 1 hour a day, 2 days a week, for a total of 12 weeks. In dance therapy practices, simple and basic movements are appropriate to the level of the participants, and special attention will be paid to the rhythm of the music not being fast. Latin dances were applied to the participants; selected rumba, merengue, bachata, and salsa movements. Dance therapy will start with a warm-up exercise (10 minutes), then dance exercises will be applied and the activity will end with a cool-down exercise (10 minutes).

Exercise sessions in both groups will last 45-60 minutes and will be applied twice a week for 12 weeks. Blood pressure measurements of all participants will be taken before the applications. Exercise participation will be recorded in each session.

The purpose of Stage 2 is to determine the preliminary efficacy of OT-82 in relapsed or refractory lymphoma at the MTD or the maximum tested dose. Both parts of the study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) of OT-82.

OT-82 treatment slowed the growth, reduced the size, or in some cases cured certain cancers in animal studies. It is hoped that participants with relapsed or refractory lymphoma treated with OT - 82 in this study will experience slowing tumor growth and/or reduction of tumor size.","OT-82 affects an enzyme in the cancer cell called nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (abbreviated NAMPT), which is involved with making energy for the cancer cell.

CVD risk factors can be modifiable (nutrition, physical activity, obesity, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes) and non-modifiable (age, gender, ethnicity, family history and socioeconomic status). Chronic exposure to CVD risk factors induces oxidative stress and promotes inflammation. In addition, endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory reaction secrete growth factors, leading to the destruction of vascular endothelium and promoting atherogenesis.

Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant compounds, with predominance of the pro-oxidant ones. Reactive Oxygen Species overproduction has been implicated in pathogenesis and complications of numerous diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic kidney disease.

Moreover, endothelium consists of a single layer of endothelial cells; it is the natural barrier between blood and tissues and also an endocrine organ. It plays a key role in vascular homeostasis by maintaining a balance between vasodilation and vasoconstriction and is responsible for fluid filtration, blood vessel tone, hormone trafficking, hemostasis, regulation of blood flow and growth of blood vessels. Thus, reductions in endothelial function are detrimental and predict and precede the development of overt CVD.

Sesame belongs to Pedaliaceae family and can be consumed in different forms such as seeds, oil or tahini, i.e., a 100 % peeled, ground and roasted sesame paste. Tahini is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, proteins, vitamin E and lignans, such as sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol. Recent studies have indicated that tahini consumption can lower blood pressure and pulse rate and improve endothelial function and glycemic response in healthy males postprandially.

However, only two studies are available in the current literature concerning the effect on diabetes, one of them in patients with type 2 diabetes and one in diabetic animal model. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of tahini consumption on oxidative stress, blood pressure, endothelial function and arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes postprandially.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD), a cluster of disorders that affect heart and blood vessels, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world and is responsible for 17.9 million deaths annually worldwide. CVD includes coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. CVD risk factors can be modifiable (nutrition, physical activity, obesity, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes) and non-modifiable (age, gender, ethnicity, family history and socioeconomic status). Chronic exposure to CVD risk factors induces oxidative stress and promotes inflammation.

Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant compounds, with predominance of the pro-oxidant ones. These compounds are also called Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) or free radicals and are unstable atoms or molecules. Their generation, as products of normal cellular metabolism, occurs naturally by endogenous sources (e.g. mitochondria, peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum) through enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. Furthermore, exogenous sources implicated in free radical production are air pollution, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, ultraviolet light exposure, industrial solvents and others. Free radical production is regulated by the well-organized human endogenous enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant system, along with the exogenous antioxidants found in food. However, in some cases antioxidant system fails to eliminate ROS overproduction and can consequently induce serious damage to important for life biomolecules (DNA, lipids, proteins), leading to cell injury and death. Thus, ROS overproduction has been implicated in pathogenesis and complications of numerous diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic kidney disease.

Sesame belongs to Pedaliaceae family and can be consumed in different forms such as seeds, oil or tahini, i.e., a 100 % peeled, ground and roasted sesame paste. Sesame seeds are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), proteins, vitamin E and lignans, such as sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol. Recent studies have highlighted the antioxidant, antihypertensive, hypolipidemic and appetite control properties of sesame seeds and sesame oil. Moreover, few studies have investigated the effect of sesame consumption on blood pressure, endothelial function and arterial stiffness in human population. According to a metanalysis, sesame consumed in form of seed, oil, capsule or bar decreased both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), while sesame oil consumption was found to improve endothelial function both in the postprandial state and after long term consumption in hypertensive men.

Regarding the consumption of tahini and its effect on human health, only a few studies are available in the current literature.

All the patients will receive ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block with injection of local anesthetic volume according to the group of the patient

* Group I (25 patients): patients will receive 5 ml levobupivacaine 0.25% ISPB
* Group II (25 patients): patients will receive 10 ml levobupivacaine 0.25% ISPB
* Group III (25 patients): patients will receive 15 ml levobupivacaine 0.25% ISPB After ensuring adequate sensory and motor blockade, general anesthesia will be carried out.

The primary outcome measurement will be the incidence of diaphragmatic hemiparesis 30 minutes after performing the block detected by US assessment of diaphragmatic excursion and the secondary outcome will be the postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption.","This prospective randomized double-blind study will be carried out on 75 patients who will be presented for shoulder arthroscopy in Tanta university hospitals over 9 months duration (September 2020- May 2021) which will be started immediately after obtaining the approval from the institutional Ethical Committee.

Informed written consent will be obtained from all the participants, all patients data will be confidential and will be used for the current study only.

Patients will be randomly classified using a computer-generated software of randomization into 3 groups:

* Group I (25 patients): patients will receive 5 ml levobupivacaine 0.25% ISPB
* Group II (25 patients): patients will receive 10 ml levobupivacaine 0.25% ISPB
* Group III (25 patients): patients will receive 15 ml levobupivacaine 0.25% ISPB

Anesthetic technique The patients will be assessed preoperatively in the anesthesia clinic through history taking, examination, and appropriate investigation. Pulmonary function tests (PEFR, FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC) will be performed preoperatively. On arrival of patients to the preparation room, an intravenous line will be established and a fluid preload will be started (7 ml/kg of lactated ringer solution) and the patient will be connected to monitor that consist of 5 leads ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximeter, and temperature were applied.

The patients will lie supine with ultrasound assessment of the diaphragmatic excursion during quiet breathing, (excluding deep breathing, crying, participants with nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, or cough, and participants with abdominal pain). Then midazolam 2 mg will be injected slow i.v with the application of nasal cannula (2-3 L/min) to the patient. Then, ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block will be done under aseptic precaution with an injection of the pre-prepared local anesthetic mixture with its volume according to the group of the patient.

The patients will be monitored for 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia, during which assessment of the sensory blockade will be carried out. The sensory block will be assessed by exposure to cold (ice piece) to the area of the shoulder and the upper arm. The motor block will be evaluated by determining patients ability to abduct the shoulder and flex the elbow against gravity (0 = no block Y full strength, 1 = partial block Y weak but able to abduct or flex against gravity, 2 = complete block Y no activity of muscle group). Preserved sensation to the cold or strength to abduct the shoulder after 30 minutes from performing the block at the area of the shoulder and upper arm will be considered as failed block and the patient will be excluded from the study. Ultrasound assessment of the diaphragmatic excursion during quiet breathing will be done again 30 minutes after performing the block.

Induction of anesthesia will be carried out after 3 minutes of pre-oxygenation through a well-fitted face mask using 80% oxygen by fentanyl 1 ug/kg, propofol 1.5 mg/kg, and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal intubation. After securing the airway through a suitable sized endotracheal tube, the patient will be connected to a mechanical ventilator with its parameters adjusted to maintain the end-tidal carbon dioxide 34-38 mmHg. Maintenance of the anesthesia will be performed by isoflurane 1.2 % in a low flow gas mixture (1 L/min) composed of oxygen: air 1:1 and incremental doses of atracurium 0.1 mg/kg. A temperature probe will be inserted in the nasopharynx for core temperature monitoring. The depth of anesthesia will be monitored by the bispectral index (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). The BIS values will be kept 40-60. An additional bolus dose of fentanyl 0.5 ug/kg was used in case of increase BIS more than 60 or increase in the heart rate or mean arterial pressure by more than 15 % of the baseline values.

At the end of the surgery, the isoflurane will be switched off with reversal of muscle relaxation by neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 0.01 mg/kg with awake tracheal extubation and transfer of the patient to the recovery room for postoperative monitoring and supplementation of oxygen through nasal cannula (2-3 L/min). All the patients will receive 4 mg dexamethasone i.v after induction of anesthesia and 4 mg of ondansetron i.v at the end of the surgery to guard against postoperative nausea and vomiting. Also, paracetamol 1 gm i.v infusion every 6 hours will be given routinely to all patients in the postoperative period. In the PACU, ultrasound-guided assessment of the diaphragmatic excursion will be done. Also, pulmonary function (PEFR, FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC) tests will be repeated before discharging the patients from the recovery room after exclusion of the effect of sedation by the aid of the modified observer¡¦s assessment of alertness.

Bradycardia (heart rate less than 50 b/min) will be managed by atropine 0.3 mg i.v) and hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg or decrease by more than 20 % of the pre-anesthesia value) will be managed by ephedrine 10 mg i.v and i.v infusion of ringer lactate that may be repeated.",COMPLETED,,2020-09-19,2022-08-24,2021-08-24,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,91,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Low volume interscalene brachial plexus block"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block with 5 ml levobupivacaine 0.25%"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Intermediate volume interscalene brachial plexus block"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block with 10 ml levobupivacaine 0.25%"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""High volume interscalene brachial plexus block"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block with 15 ml levobupivacaine 0.25%"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",PROCEDURE;PROCEDURE;PROCEDURE,low volume interscalene brachial plexus block;intermediate volume interscalene brachial plexus block;high volume interscalene brachial plexus block,1

OTHER,NCT04716179,Prospective Two-arm Study of Fertility in Men With COVID-19,Prospective Two-arm Study of Fertility in Men With COVID-19,COVID-19 infection is hypothesized to have a potentially negative effect on male fertility through direct damage to the testes. The current trial is aimed at investigating the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on fertility and determining if viral bodies are capable of directly damaging testicular cells,"In late December 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan witnessed the emergence of a form of pneumonia of unknown etiology. By the middle of January 2020, the disease had managed to spread beyond the country of origin and is now classified by the WHO as the largest pandemic in modern history.

Rapidly spreading and highly contagious, the infection prompted medical professionals all over the world to begin research into the virus with the goal of developing early diagnostic techniques and treatment strategies.

The new pathogen named SARS-Cov-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family. These viruses cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1, 2002-2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012-2013).

The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the human body stem from its structure. The spike proteins on the surface of the virus, which are responsible for the name ""Coronaviridae,"" means that it is able to bind to the host receptor protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This makes cells with high quantities of these receptors on the surface susceptible to the virus.

The genome of SARS-Cov-2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic contains both human coronavirus fragments and bat coronavirus fragments (HKU9-1). It is the genetic material of HKU9-1 that makes SARS-CoV-2 unknown to the immune system of the human body.

As of today, three transmission pathways are recognized: close contact, airborne and fomite. Moreover, the virus is known to retain its contagious properties on surfaces for up to 72 hours, and the incubation period ranges between 2 and 14 days. Recent reports indicate that up to 80% of those infected by COVID-19 showed mild or moderate symptoms whereas 20-30% develop severe forms of the disease characterized by shock as well as respiratory and multiple organ failure. According to Chinese and Italian healthcare providers, the mortality rate is between 3.8 and 7.2%.

Zou et al. (2020) reported that non-respiratory symptoms may be explained by the binding of the virus to ACE-2 in other organs. Shen and Wang (2020) proved that ACE-2 is also expressed by testicular cells (namely spermatogonia, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells) which makes them potential targets for the virus. In fact, there are reports of orchitis and epididymitis in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. This means that SARS-CoV-2 may directly damage testicular tissue potentially compromising male fertility.

In a number of studies, PCR did not detect the virus in semen samples obtained during both the acute phase and recovery phase. In another study, postmortem needle and open biopsies of the testicles performed within an hour after death from COVID-19 revealed that testicular tissues were free of SARS-CoV-2 in 10 of 11 cases (91%). At the same time, spermograms in COVID-19 patients showed low ejaculate volume, sperm motility and sperm count. Previously, it was shown that COVID-19 has a severe effect on vasculature and therefore a microthrombi could be a possible contributor to fertility impairment. An assessment of testes with a Doppler enhanced ultrasound was therefore necessary.

Data dedicated to testosterone levels in the blood and inflammatory markers in the semen and testicular tissues is lacking. Available literature indicates changes in the above-mentioned parameters in males with verified COVID-19.

There is ultimately too little information to draw reliable conclusions regarding the effects of the virus on male reproduction. Published reports are limited by small study groups, lack of the control group and absence of follow-up examinations during recovery warranting further research and in-depth exploration of the topic.",UNKNOWN,,2021-01-18,2021-08-31,2021-05-18,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,BASIC_SCIENCE,88,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Sperm test"", ""type"": ""DIAGNOSTIC_TEST"", ""description"": ""The semen sample will be collected and analyzed within an hour after collection."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""hormone levels (testosterone, FSH, LH, prolactin)"", ""type"": ""DIAGNOSTIC_TEST"", ""description"": ""Hormone levels (testosterone, FSH, LH, prolactin) will be assessed on 5-7 days after symptom onset until the end of hospital stay."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""SARS-CoV-2 Ig G levels"", ""type"": ""DIAGNOSTIC_TEST"", ""description"": ""SARS-CoV-2 Ig G levels will be assessed on 3 months after discharge"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Testis pathology samples"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Postmortem examination of the testes of patients deceased as a result of COVID-19 infection will be carried out using immunohistochemistry analysis."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DIAGNOSTIC_TEST;DIAGNOSTIC_TEST;DIAGNOSTIC_TEST;OTHER,"sperm test;hormone levels (testosterone, fsh, lh, prolactin);sars-cov-2 ig g levels;testis pathology samples",0

The purpose of this study is measure the alterations in renal blood oxygenation after angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibition. The understanding of kidney adaptive mechanisms to renin angiotensin system effects in healthy subjects will be useful for the early detection of renal disease and for the development of new therapies to decrease the progression of the disease and its consequences.,"Subjects The study will be conducted under a protocol (number 4111/08) approved by the Ethics Committee of the Instituto de Cardiologia do Rio Grande do Sul-Fundação Universitária de Cardiologia/Brazil. After giving their informed consent,the patients will participate in the study. None of the subjects will take medication,food and water overnight. All measurements will be performed at the end of the morning.

After control BOLD-MRI measurements acquisition, subjects will take an oral ACE inhibitor (captopril 25 mg). Thirty minutes after captopril administration, without moving from the scanner, blood pressure will be measured and a second BOLD acquisition will be performed to detect a possible alteration in the renal oxygenation. Data will be collected by two radiologists and interpreted by a physician and a physiologist.

MR Imaging Technique Images were acquired using 1.5T HDx (Sigma, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Win) and an 8 channels body coil.

Localizer images will be performed with axial and sagittal planes following the long axis of both kidneys, using breath hold and fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) technique.

Oblique axial and coronal reference images will be acquired for color maps following approximately the short and long axis of both kidneys using FSPGR with the following parameters: FOV=40cm, matrix 256x128, slice thickness=5cm, slice gap 6cm, 3 slices per plane in one breath hold. TR=150ms, TE=min full, FLIP=90, rBW=62KHz, 1NEX. This sequence provides an excellent contrast between cortex and medulla and avoid the unnecessary use of a contrast agents.

BOLD sensitive images will be acquired using the multiple echo FGRE sequence with the same geometrical parameters. The reference images considered will have the following parameters: TR = 60ms, FLIP=30, rBW=60KHz, 16 echoes from TE=2.1ms until 49.6ms, echo interval of 3.2ms, 1 NEX.

BOLD imaging Data Processing Bold image processing will be performed using the Function R2\* module for R2\*/T2\* fitting, assuming single exponential decay without constant offset at AW4.3 (GE Healthcare).

For visualization and quantification, R2\* parametric maps will be generated for each slice.(11, 18-19) A Puh Talium color table will be used, since it was a dynamic range with minimum value set at 7.0/sec and maximum value at 23/sec. Color will be ranged from blue to red, close to minimum R2\* and below and close to maximum R2\* and above, respectively. The green/yellow will be assumed as intermediate. When a position mismatch due to a different breath hold state, anatomical fat suppressed FSPGR images were used as transparent references over a parametric map or original BOLD images.

One slice out of three, which provided the best differentiation between cortex and medulla and minimum partial volume, will be selected for quantification. A total of 6 regions of interest (ROI) with a 9 pixel size were used, 3 positioned at the cortex and 3 at the medulla for each plane.

The ROIs will be positioned at the cortex according to the anatomical reference image (light gray) and blue on the parametric map. The ROIs will be positioned at the medulla using either the anatomical reference image (dark gray) or the parametric map that showed a green, yellow and red gradient (figure 1). Areas with susceptibility artifacts, such as bowel gas or areas with renal hilum vessels, will be avoided.

Data analysis The statistical analysis will be determined by variance test for three repeated measures (ANOVA). Data are presented as the mean ± SD.

OTHER,NCT02915679,Pain Perception in Suicidal Behavior Vulnerability,Pain Perception in Suicidal Behavior Vulnerability,"In France, almost 1 death on 50 is a suicide. The suicide occurs in unbearable psychic pain where mental trouble has a major influence. It is classified as preventable mortality. According to interpersonal psychological theory of suicide, the repeated exposition to stressful and painful events (as physical abuse) would facilitate suicide attempt through the increased pain tolerance.

OTHER,NCT01462279,Effect of Thiamine on Oxygen Utilization (VO2) in Critical Illness,The Effect of Thiamine on VO2 Levels in Critically Ill Patients,The objective of this study is to determine the effect of thiamine therapy on oxygen consumption in critically-ill patients. The investigators will evaluate this by measuring VO2 before and after thiamine administration in patients admitted to the ICU and requiring mechanical ventilation.,"Extensive research has been done over the past two decades looking at the role of oxygen delivery (DO2) and oxygen utilization (VO2) in critical illness. VO2 depends on cardiac output, arterial oxygen content, and the body's ability to extract oxygen effectively from the blood. Oxygen demand rises in critical illness as the body goes into a catabolic state, and lower VO2 has been associated with higher lactate levels and with poorer outcomes. Although increasing DO2 will often raise VO2, Hayes et al found that a subset of critically-ill patients failed to demonstrate a rise in VO2 in spite of achieving supranormal values of cardiac index (CI) and DO2. This group, in contrast to patients whose VO2 rose with the increase in CI and DO2, had exceedingly poor outcomes, suggesting that an inability to extract oxygen from the blood confers a poorer prognosis.(1)

Thiamine deficiency can manifest in several ways, but the syndrome of wet beriberi, caused by thiamine deficiency, includes lactic acidosis, cardiac decompensation and vasodilatory shock, similar to sepsis and other forms of critical illness. The mechanism by which thiamine deficiency causes dysfunction rests upon the vitamin's essential role in the Krebs cycle and Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Lack of adequate thiamine results in the failure of pyruvate to enter the Krebs Cycle, thus preventing aerobic metabolism. The resulting decrease in aerobic metabolism and increase in anaerobic metabolism leads to decreased oxygen consumption by the tissues and increased lactic acid production. The investigators group has found previously that upwards of 20% of critically ill patients with sepsis are thiamine deficient within 72 hours of presentation. In a dog model of septic shock, Lindenbaum et al have shown that, regardless of thiamine levels, supplementation with thiamine improved not only lactate clearance and mean arterial pressure, but increased VO2 as well. The effect of thiamine on VO2 in critically ill humans has not yet been reported, but an increase in VO2 max after administration of thiamine to healthy volunteers has been described. VO2 is known to rise in inflammatory states, reflecting increased energy expenditure. Prior studies have shown that VO2 will decrease with interventions such as fever control. In spite of VO2 being higher than normal in critically-ill patients, however, the end-organ damage and lactic acidosis suggest that it is not high enough to meet the metabolic demands of the critically-ill body. If the investigators were able to increase VO2 further in critically-ill patients, the investigators could potentially help maintain aerobic metabolism and decrease tissue hypoxia and the resulting end-organ damage. The investigators hypothesis is that administering thiamine intravenously to critically-ill patients will increase VO2.

Multiple methods of measuring VO2 have been used in the ICU, but in the current era where invasive monitoring with routine use of PA catheters is no longer the norm, indirect calorimetry became, for a time, the gold standard for measurement of gas exchange in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients.(2) The metabolic cart used for indirect calorimetry is cumbersome and requires frequent calibration to maintain accuracy, however, and a newer, more portable method has been designed. The Datex-Ohmeda M-COVX device has been approved for the measurement of VO2 and VCO2 in mechanically ventilated patients. In studies, it has been validated as a method that is as accurate as indirect calorimetry, and perhaps even more accurate at higher FiO2.(3,4) The Datex-Ohmeda M-COVX connects to the Carescape B650 monitor made by GE, and measures VO2 through a single-use spirometer that attaches to the patient's ventilator tubing. In the following proposal, the investigators present a plan to examine the effect of thiamine therapy on VO2 in 30 critically-ill, mechanically ventilated patients, using the Datex-Ohmeda M-COVX module to measure VO2 before and after thiamine administration.",COMPLETED,,2011-09,2012-10,2012-10,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,20,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Thiamine"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""200mg of intravenous thiamine in 50ml of D5W will be infused over 30 minutes once"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,thiamine,1

Aneurysmal disease can affect any segment of the aorta, from the aortic root to the aortic bifurcation. Juxtarenal Aortic Aneurysms (JAA) (where a specialty designed custom -made device (endograft)which has holes, or fenestrations ,on the graft body to maintain the patency of the visceral arteries) account for approximately 15% of abdominal aortic aneurysms.2

Successful aortic aneurysm treatment depends on either open replacement or endovascular exclusion of the aneurysmal segment with healthy artery proximal and distal to the repair.

The decision to treat an AAA is based on the associated risk of treatment, the risk of aneurysm rupture, the patient's life expectancy, and patient preference.

The primary determinant of rupture risk is maximum aneurysm diameter, with negligible rupture risk in aneurysms \<4cm in diameter compared with aneurysms \>8 cm . 3, 4.

There are patients with severe AA who may have little or no improvement from the treatment by diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) or topical steroid with minoxidil but instead having positive response from the treatment with Janus kinase(JAK) inhibitor such as Tofacitinib or Ruxolitinib. For the best of my knowledge, there was no previous study in using Tofacitinib to treat severe AA before in Thailand.","Alopecia areata (AA) or spot baldness, is a condition in which hair falls off from areas of the body. It often happens on the scalp, causing a few bald spots and it may result in psychological stress even though people are generally healthy. AA is believed to be an autoimmune disease progressing from a breach in the immune privilege of the hair follicles that causes hair to fall out in small patches, it may remain unnoticeable until the patches eventually connect and then become noticeable. It can develop slowly, and also recur after years between occurrences.

By standard AA treatment guideline, DPCP is the first treatment protocol and may follow with anthralin or minoxidil. This oldy but goody treatment gives a good result of 75% in spotty hair loss and 25% in total baldness. The new invention of treatment has been introduced in the past 2 years by using JAK inhibitor, an oral medicine such as Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib. This treatment gives a good outcome so far in this short period of time, 54-81.9% of patients had over 50% increase of hair grows over the original protocol. The theory is that JAK inhibitors would inhibit interferon-gamma and interleukin-15 signal between white blood cell and hair follicle which reducing the rate of destroying hair follicles.

The investigators propose the study to assess the safety and efficacy of Tofacitinib for extensive and recalcitrant AA and to evaluate the economic impact effecting the AA patients. Tofacitinib is an expensive medicine and needed to be taken up to 6 months to finish the course to have a best outcome so it is not a popular choice of AA treatment at present time unless it can show a promising result in recalcitrant AA.",COMPLETED,,2019-01-12,2021-01-30,2021-01-30,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,19,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Tofacitinib"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Tofacitinib is an oral medicine in Janus kinase inhibitor 3 group which has been approved by FDA in treating Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Advancements in the care provided in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) have led to fewer deaths in children. These improvements are unfortunately countered by the emergence of side effects of critical illness, known as PICU-acquired complications (PACs). Delirium, muscle weakness, drug dependency and withdrawal are increasingly common. PACs occur because children are often over-sedated and experience long periods of immobilization. PACs delay recovery, increase disability and worsen long-term function and quality-of-life. Although they are preventable, PACs are very common and frequently overlooked by clinicians.

In spite of the substantial advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention it remains one of the most common complications in conventional abdominal surgery with an incidence in the literature between 4% and 17%. As it is known that surgical sutures potentiate the development of wound infection the search for an ideal suture material, suitable for all purposes has been pursued by surgeons for decades.

Hypothesis: In line with in-vitro results the investigators hypothesize that the use of antibacterial skin sutures with triclosan poliglecaprone 25 reduces the rate of SSI after open abdominal surgery Methods: To prevent microbial colonization of suture material in operative wounds and therefore to prevent SSI, triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25 suture materials with antibacterial activity will be tested against un-coated suture material for skin closure after open abdominal surgery of 200 patients. The study is planed as a single center, randomized controlled trial. After ethical approval the patients will be consecutively enrolled from 2011 to 2012 in the Department of Visceral Surgery, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The patients will be followed for 30 days (day 3,7 and 30) to detect and document wound complications. Wound complications will be classified according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention Standard guidelines. Data will be collected and the rate of SSI will be analysed in both groups.

Expected value of the proposed project: If the investigators can confirm the proposed hypothesis in our study this could be a promising and feasible approach to lower SSI after open abdominal surgery and might be also used in other surgical fields.

OTHER,NCT06901479,The Study of Postoperative Delirium and Glymphatic System Function in Cardiac Surgery,The Study of Postoperative Delirium and Glymphatic System Function in Cardiac Surgery,"Postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery is an acute cerebral dysfunction characterized by inattention, impaired consciousness, and cognitive and orientation disturbances. It manifests clinically as acute onset, severe neurocognitive impairment, and periodic fluctuating progression, and is one of the most common complications after major cardiac and vascular surgery. It typically occurs within one week after surgery, with a peak incidence at 24 hours postoperatively. Due to differences in the basic characteristics of study populations and assessment tools, the reported incidence of postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery varies significantly, ranging from 14% to 50%. Postoperative delirium not only prolongs patients' ICU and hospital stays, increases medical costs, and raises short-term and long-term mortality rates, but is also closely associated with long-term cognitive impairment, dementia, and a decline in activities of daily living. The pathophysiology of delirium is complex and may be caused by a combination of multiple factors, including microembolism, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and systemic inflammatory response. Since the mechanisms underlying delirium are not yet fully understood, effective treatments are currently lacking. Postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery is a significant clinical challenge for medical teams.

The brain is distinct from other organs, as the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier isolate the exchange between the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and extracellular fluid. For a long time, it was believed that the brain lacks a lymphatic system, and the extracellular fluid in brain tissue was considered stagnant. The lack of fluid flow can lead to the accumulation of protein waste, which is very detrimental to brain health. The glymphatic system is a major update in the anatomical knowledge of the central nervous system in recent years. It is a highly organized fluid transport system within the human brain, with the primary function of promoting convective exchange between the interstitial fluid of the central nervous system and cerebrospinal fluid. The main physiological function of the glymphatic system is to clear metabolic waste and large-molecule solutes, thereby maintaining central homeostasis; it also acts as a communicator between the brain and peripheral immunity, ensuring that the central nervous system is not overlooked by the immune system. Additionally, the glymphatic system helps deliver nutrients to the brain, such as glucose, lactate, and amino acids. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system is associated with various neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and related research has become a frontier and hotspot in the field of neuroscience.

Dysfunction of the glymphatic system leads to the accumulation of β-amyloid and tau proteins in the brain, which cannot be cleared, and is one of the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. There is a strong bidirectional association between Alzheimer's disease and delirium. Patients with Alzheimer's disease-related dementia are 2.5 to 4.7 times more likely to experience delirium, and the incidence of newly diagnosed Alzheimer's disease-related dementia in patients with delirium increases by 12.5 times. However, the underlying mechanisms of postoperative delirium remain unclear, which has motivated our investigation into the causal relationship between the glymphatic system and postoperative delirium. From a theoretical perspective, chronic dysfunction of the glymphatic system signifies brain vulnerability and a higher incidence of neurological diseases. If subjected to surgical stress, sudden dysfunction may represent acute glymphatic system insufficiency. With the rapid development of clinical imaging tools, functional MRI is a non-invasive method for assessing glymphatic system function, bringing possibilities to clinical research.

Therefore, this study aims to explore the association between postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery and the glymphatic system, in order to deepen the understanding of glymphatic system function and investigate the mechanisms of postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery, and to provide ideas for new interventions for postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery.",,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2025-03-10,2028-12-31,2028-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,200,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Blood was drawn for proteomics testing and Magnetic Resonance Imaging."", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""The function of the glymphatic system was assessed by MRI before the surgery.

Clinical and radiographic examination of the primary molar will be conducted to ensure compliance with the study criteria. Oral health instructions will be given to the child and parents then the application of local anesthesia.

1. Stainless steel crowns:

   Reduction of occlusal surface by about 1.5 mm using a flame shaped diamond bur to produce a uniform occlusal reduction. Proximal reduction using a long and tapered diamond bur to allow the probe to pass through the contact area. An appropriate size will be selected according to mesiodistal width of the prepared tooth and a trial fit will be carried out before cementation. The crown should remain no more than 1 mm subgingivally.(21)
2. Zirconia and hybrid ceramic crowns:

   The appropriate size of the posterior crown will be selected for the tooth chosen for treatment. The occlusal surface will be reduced by 1-2 mm by using a flame bur after evaluation of the occlusal relationships. The interproximal areas will be opened followed by reduction of the crown dimensions by 0.5-1.25 mm using a tapered diamond bur making the contour of the prepared tooth consistent with the natural contour. The prepared tooth walls will be finished with a 1-2 mm subgingival feather-edge preparation using a thinner pointed tapered diamond bur.

   The selected crown will be tested for appropriate fit before the final cementation. Finally, the prepared tooth will be cleaned from saliva, blood, and the remnants of preparation and ready for cementation.(15) The selected crown will be cleaned and then filled with resin modified glass ionomer cement. The crown will be applied with no resistance to the fully seated position on the tooth (Passive Fit) since forcing the crown to place can produce micro-fractures in the zirconia structure. Excess cement will be removed using a dental probe and dental floss.

   Clinical evaluation:

   o Evaluation criteria concerning the clinical performance are

1) The Gingival Index (GI)(22) will be measured by the William Gingival Probe with a blunt-ended instrument gently placed within the gingival gutter around each tooth to be crowned/previously crowned, and the values will be as follows: 0 = normal gingiva

1. = mild inflammation: a slight change in color, slight edema, no bleeding on probing
2. = moderate inflammation: redness, edema, and glazing, or bleeding on probing
3. =severe inflammation: marked redness and edema, a tendency toward spontaneous bleeding, ulceration.

2) Plaque Index (PI)(22) will be measured by passing the gingival probe around each tooth to be crowned/previously crowned, and the values will be as follows: 0 = no plaque

1= film at the gingival margin and adjacent tooth 2 = moderate accumulation of plaque 3 = abundance of plaque.

Crown retention (23) will be measured as follows:

0 = present.

1 = absent.

Crown integrity(24) will be measured as follows:

0 = intact.

1. = crack present.
2. = fracture present.
3. = crown lost.

Marginal adaptation will be measured clinically and radiographically:

1) All crowns will be evaluated clinically at baseline, 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th months and scored as follows:(25) 0 = Margin not discernible, probe does not catch.

1. = Probe catches on margin but no gap on probing.
2. = Probe catches on margin and a gap on probing.
3. = Crown fractured or missing. 2) All crowns will be evaluated radiographically at baseline, 6th, and 12th months to check the marginal adaptation.

Color stability(26) will be measured as follows:

0 = Unchanged.

1 = Minor deviation from original. Wear of the antagonistic natural enamel. To evaluate the wear of the antagonistic natural enamel of primary molar, a rubber base impressions will be made immediately (baseline) and at 1 year after cementation. The resulting casts will be scanned (using a 3D scanner), and 3D softare will be used to calculate the maximum amount of linear wear. (27)

o Evaluation criteria regarding the crown convenience: Time elapsed since the start of tooth preparation till the crown cementation. Anxiety using the Facial Image Scale (FIS).(28) The Facial image scale comprises a row of five faces ranging from very happy to very unhappy. The children were asked to point at which face they felt most like at that moment. The scale is scored by giving a value of one to the most positive affect face and five to the most negative affect face.

These include: (1) an analysis of the incidence and severity of mucositis, severity, treatment methods, and treatment costs; (2) an RCT comparing the effectiveness of honey, Taiwan green propolis, and usual care in mucositis of cancer patients; (3) monitoring of related symptom changes using a smart bracelet device; (4) a measurement of IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF in saliva and (4) modeling of the trend of mucositis for alertness and search of essential parameters of the complications.","Mucositis is common among cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A total of 80-100% of the patients are suffering from the mucositis pain; their regular dieting is disturbed, nutritional status deteriorated, and even treatment discontinued. Some self-paid medications like glutamine have been used to prevent mucositis before and during radiotherapy/chemotherapy. However, the cost of glutamine is relatively high (NT15,000 month/person) and its treatment efficacy and side effects are still to be determined. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and experiments have shown that honey and propolis may be used for the management of mucositis. Taiwan is a country of rich agriculture with unique bee products among which the longan honey demonstrates the most significant antibacterial effects; the green propolis has also been proved to comprise antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. However, none of these propolis products have been specifically trialed for the management of mucositis of cancer patients.

Bee products have been concerned as potential sources of natural antioxidants such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenoids. Their potential treatment effects have caught the attention of the medical community. Accumulating evidence is supporting the use of bee products in mucositis caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both. However, systematic review and meta-analysis have suggested a low quality of the included RCTs, and this affects the applicability of the evidence in the real clinical scenario.

The investigators plan to conduct a 3-year pioneering care research project for mucositis in cancer patients.

OTHER,NCT01954979,Abatacept to Treat Steroid Refractory Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD),A Phase I Study of Abatacept in the Treatment of Patients With Steroid Refractory Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD),"The participant is invited to take part in this study because they have chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGVHD) that is not responding to standard treatment with steroids. This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about the treatment of patients with cGVHD. This research study is evaluating a drug called abatacept.

Abatacept is a drug that alters and suppresses the immune system. Abatacept is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults and of severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in patients who have failed prior therapy with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These are autoimmune conditions, ie caused by an overactive immune system that attacks normal tissues and organs. It is currently being tested in a variety of other autoimmune conditions. In this case it is considered experimental.

cGVHD is caused by the donor cells attacking various organs of the recipient. The investigators try to minimize this immune attack by using corticosteroids such as prednisone. In severe cases prednisone is not sufficient and other immunosuppressive medications are used in addition in order to more efficiently control cGVHD and to limit the dose and consequently the multiple side-effects of corticosteroids. This study is being done to determine if the use of abatacept is safe in patients with cGVHD and if it can facilitate a better control of cGVHD.

During this study the participants will be evaluated for side effects from the treatment with abatacept, and for response of the cGVHD to the treatment. There will be two groups of participants in the study. The first group will be treated at a relatively low dose of abatacept. If this is found to be safe then the second group will be treated at a higher dose. Three to four tablespoons of blood will be drawn at every 2 week visit in order to determine your blood counts, kidney and liver function. Some of the blood will be used in a research lab in order to study measures of your immune system and how they might be affected by the treatment.","Before the research starts (screening): After signing the consent form, the participant will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if they can be in the research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cGVHD care and may be done even if it turns out that the participant does not take part in the research study. If the participant has had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated.

* Complete Medical History and Physical Examination
* Blood Collection: 3-4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to measure the participants complete blood counts, kidney, liver and thyroid function
* Disease Assessment: Depending on what organs are affected by their cGVHD the participant may undergo blood tests or a skin exam or an eye exam or a dental exam.
* Electrocardiogram (EKG): a noninvasive test that measures the electrical activity of the participant's heart
* A tuberculin skin test and a quantiferon blood test to rule out tuberculosis
* Pregnancy testing if applicable
* HIV and Hepatitis blood test: 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be collected to perform an HIV test. The participant will be asked to sign a separate consent form for this test. The participant's doctor will discuss the results of this test with the participant and the results will become a part of their permanent medical record. The participant may seek private HIV testing prior to consenting, and based on the results may choose whether or not to participate in this study or have the HIV test become part of their medical records.

If these tests show that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study, the participant will begin the study treatment. If the participant does not meet the eligibility criteria, the participant will not be able to participate in this research study.

Additional research procedures to be performed at the time of screening:

- Research blood testing: to study measures of the participant's immune system

After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study:

* Since the investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have abatacept, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose the participant gets will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before the participant and how well they have tolerated their doses.
* The total duration of treatment on this study is approximately 113 days or 6 treatments. Doses 1-3 will be administered every two weeks. One month following Dose 3, abatacept will be administered every four weeks for the remaining three doses (Doses 4-6.) The treatment will be given intravenously on these days. One month following your last dose of treatment, the participant will be seen in clinic. The participant will be seen in the clinic weekly through dose 4, then every 2 weeks for follow up even if the participant doesn't have treatment.
* The first group of participants will be treated with a lower dose of abatacept. If this dose is determined to be safe then the second group will be treated at a higher dose.

During treatment the participant will be seen in the clinic every two weeks. At every visit the following will be performed:

* Complete Medical History and Physical Examination
* Blood Collection: 3-4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to measure their complete blood counts, kidney, liver and thyroid function
* Research blood testing: to study measures of the participant's immune system
* On the days of treatment the participant will undergo an assessment of cGVHD depending on what organs are affected

After the final dose of the study drug:

After the participant has completed taking the drug on the study, the following procedures and tests will take place:

* Safety assessment 28 days after the last dose of the study drug.
* Complete Medical History and Physical Examination
* Blood Collection: 3-4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to measure the participant's complete blood counts, kidney, liver and thyroid function
* Disease Assessment: by physical exam and blood tests if the participant has leukemia or multiple myeloma, or physical exam and PET/CT or CT scan if the participant has lymphoma. These will be done at the safety assessment visit and at the 3 and 6 month follow up visits.
* Electrocardiogram
* Research blood testing: to study measures of your immune system

The investigators will use user-centered participatory design methods and real-time analysis to inform the refinement of the recently developed Electronic Health Record (EHR) model-based decision support tool and test it during the pre-and post-implementation stages.","Aim 1: To successfully implement a morphine PK and individualized precision dosing decision aid into workflows of neonatal prescribing clinicians.

This study will evaluate the steps required to successfully implement a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model-informed real-time decision support interface for the prescribing of neonatal pain and sedation medications. Currently, most opiate and benzodiazepine treatment is done by empirical dosing without any knowledge of drug concentrations, which can easily lead to under or over-dosing of medications. Background data show that over 65% of infants who are placed on morphine experience blood concentrations well above the currently suggested target ranges. This project will incorporate PK model-informed dosing and eventually include real-time drug concentration information feedback directly into prescribers' workflows so that they can make a data-informed decision, thus allowing maximal therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the likelihood of adverse events. The expected outcomes are better clinical efficacy and safety with fewer side effects in the neonatal population.

Study design Open label, prospective, quasi-experimental study that will use data collected during patients' Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) hospitalization at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center (CCHMC).

The study will use user-centered participatory design methods to establish the optimal means of incorporating this decision support into already existing workflows. These findings will allow the investigators to implement the clinical decision support directly into clinical practice during the study period. During and following implementation, the investigators will use a mixed methods approach through continually evaluating the effectiveness of the precision dosing application through technical analytics, real-time user feedback, and clinical data feedback. Technical process outcomes will consist of usage analysis statistics such as application access logs, time spent viewing the application, and technical error rates (e.g., failure of the application to launch or load data). Users will have the option to provide direct in-app feedback. Such feedback is necessary for successful agile software development and will be incorporated into regular revisions of the tool. In addition, the investigators will use clinical data including subjective bedside pain and sedation assessments as well as objective morphine concentration data to help further refine the PK/PD models.

Prospective evaluation of the decision support tool The investigators will start using the tool to provide dosing guidance based on patient information and the morphine PK model predictions but without using morphine concentrations as feedback for 3-6 months. This is anticipated to be the time required to prospectively test the tool while putting in place the logistics for timed sampling and morphine concentration measurements in real-time. Only members of the study team will have access to the tool at this time. When the clinical team is discussing the morphine usage over the last 24 hours and before the pain/sedation plan is developed, the member of the study team that is reviewing the tool will introduce this information on rounds. Currently the NICU clinical pharmacist on the study team reviews NeoRelief during rounds to assess morphine doses being used and the estimated concentrations based on the model. The tool will be made available to the other members of the study team as part of the roll out. The model-based dosing suggestions are not meant to take the place of clinical judgement. It is impossible to take into account all of the unique variables that go in to developing a pain management plan for a patient. If the clinical team choses to deviate from the recommendations, the clinical pharmacists will make a note as to why the decision was made to deviate from the recommendation.

Once the logistics of morphine concentration measurement and reporting by the mass spectrometry laboratory have been worked out, the investigators will continue with the prospective evaluation of the decision support tool by now also taking into account morphine concentration measurement(s) as 'feedback' using remnant samples. This will allow for Bayesian estimation and prediction of a patient's individual PK profile. Again, since the goal is the incorporation of the tool into the workflow, only members of the study team will have access to the tool information. When the team is discussing the morphine usage over the last 24 hours and before the pain/sedation plan is developed this information will be introduced on rounds. This will provide the investigators with an objective way to determine if it is being effectively incorporated into the workflow.

Study population and inclusion criteria:

Participants will be preterm and term neonates who receive intravenously (IV) administered morphine for 24 hours or more in the CCHMC NICU as part of standard clinical pain care management. The study target is a minimum of 200 evaluable research participants. All infants in the CCHMC NICU regardless of gender, race, or age are potential subjects. The investigators anticipate that enrolled participants will be of mixed demographics. There will be no exclusions based on gender or ethnicity.

Data Collection and Management:

A central electronic database will be constructed for storing all study-related data. REDCap will be used as the database software and will be password protected. REDCap is a secure, web-based application for building and managing online surveys and databases and a resource of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training provided to researchers affiliated with the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center. Access will be restricted to the primary investigator and designated study personnel.

Demographic and Clinical Data: Patient demographic data and clinical data will be collected from the electronic medical record EPIC. Data to be collected will include:

* Patient ID
* Birth measurements - weight, length, head circumference
* Age - estimated gestational, chronological, corrected gestational, postmenstrual
* Diagnosis
* Post-operative complications, as applicable
* Date and time of morphine initiation
* Morphine dose and infusion rates
* Times and changes to morphine infusion rates
* Time and dose of any morphine boluses given
* Prior history of opiate and benzodiazepine exposure
* Concomitant medications and any other medication levels
* Medical conditions and diagnoses
* Laboratory values - Creatinine and transaminases
* Vital signs - heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation
* NPASS scores: Along with physiologic indicators of pain (i.e., vital signs), behavioral indicators of pain will be collected using the Neonatal Pain Agitation and Sedation Scale. The NPASS is a validated pain scoring system that incorporates crying and irritability, behavioral state, facial expression, extremity tone, and vital signs (HR, RR, BP, SaO2) to assess neonatal pain and sedation that is consistently used in the CCHMC NICU.
* Withdrawal Assessment Tool - Version 1 (WAT-1) scoring for signs of withdrawal (if available); otherwise by collecting data on patients subjectively withdrawing, and/or requiring a taper as per the clinical team.

The study will include the collection of discarded blood samples (remnant samples) from neonates who are already receiving morphine as part of their standard of care. This approach is successfully utilized in several 'POPS' studies (Pediatric Opportunistic Pharmacokinetic Studies as part of Pharmacokinetics of Understudied Drugs Administered to Children per Standard of Care program) conducted by the Pediatric Trials Network (http://pediatric trials.org/).

Analysis Plan and Sample Size:

Primary clinical outcomes will be a comparison of pre-implementation compared with post-implementation amounts of morphine given, as measured by number of PRN medications given, area under the morphine concentration time curve, and cumulative amount of morphine exposure above target concentration. Secondary outcomes will include an evaluation of usability of the application using the System Usability Scale, indicating the extent to which the tool is being used by those who have access and the extent to which it is effectively incorporated into rounds to provide effective and safe analgesia for neonates with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. After the initial development period, we will collect data obtained from 200 neonates for a minimum of 18 months for analysis of both the process and clinical outcomes.

Aim 2. Characterize the morphine exposure-response relationship by prospective evaluation of dose requirements, morphine concentration, and pain parameters using PK and PD modeling.

The investigators will use validated approaches that have been supported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency to develop a population PK/PD model using nonlinear mixed effect analysis based on plasma concentrations of morphine and pain and sedation assessment scores and vital sign trends (PD data) in relation to the clinical procedure of study data enriched with retrospectively collected data. This methodology not only allows one to estimate the ""typical"" pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile for the population but also will characterize between and within PK variability for each patient over time. Through a hierarchical modeling process, clinical characteristics can be identified to help account for some of the observed variabilities and ultimately result in improved patient specific dosing. This approach is particularly useful in identifying age related effects and given the general sparseness of blood samples, the population approach is well suited for studying pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in pediatric populations. The model will include a description of the maturation of morphine metabolism and clearance based on postmenstrual age and time after birth as described in the literature. Model development and validation will be performed according to good modeling practices.

Aim 3. Evaluate generalizability of the precision dosing platform by extending the platform to include a synergistic medication, midazolam.

Development of midazolam module:

The NeoRelief decision support application is a modular platform developed to be extended to other frequently used medications in the NICU such as midazolam. Published midazolam PK models will will be coded in and serve as the starting point for a fully functional decision support tool for precision dosing of midazolam. This process will be supported by the CCHMC IS team who integrated systems specifications and interphase requirements for secure data exchange between Epic and the morphine decision support platform.

Analysis Plan and Sample Size The evaluation plan and measures will be the same as those enumerated for Specific Aim 1; (a) technical analytics including usage rates, time spent in the application, accessibility; (b) user feedback and usability testing; (c) clinical outcomes including doses of medication given, PRN doses administered, and cumulative dosing measurements. After the initial development period, the investigators will collect data obtained from 50 neonates for a minimum of 18 months for analysis of both the process and clinical outcomes.",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2018-09-28,2024-12,2024-12,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,200,ESTIMATED,[],,,0

Phantom sensations are defined as pain-free perceptions emanating from the lost body part after deafferentation, and phantom pain is a painful or unpleasant sensation in the distribution of the lost or deafferented body part 5. Phantom sensations can be a different expression of phantom pain and interfere with rehabilitation therapy by enhancing and interacting with phantom pain.

The current standard of care is pre-operative nerve blockade to prevent peripheral sensitization leading to future onset of phantom limb pain. Successful outcomes necessitate effective communication between the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and the various teams involved in the post-operative rehabilitation of the patient. A consultation with the Acute Pain Service or similar entity that performs peripheral nerve blockade pre-operatively and then follows the patient during their post-operative inpatient course is an important factor in the success in early prevention of acute and chronic pain for these patients.

Pericapsular nerve group block or PENG block is a novel regional nerve block to provide analgesia in fractured hip patients. It is primarily an ultrasound-guided (USG) technique where target area is the pelvic rim (superior pubic ramus) near iliopectineal eminence, deep to fascia of iliopsoas muscle. Articular branches of femoral nerve and accessory obturator nerves, which cross over the bony rim, are primary targets of the PENG block.however, by increasing volume of local anesthetic drug; other nerves (obturator, femoral, genitofemoral, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve) can be blocked.

The management of knee OA is demanded to several specialists, including general practitioners, rheumatologists, orthopedics and finally geriatricians. However, the exact role of geriatricians in the management of knee OA was poorly studied, whilst the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is widely used for preventing negative consequences in older people.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, and is characterized by joint pain and stiffness leading to functional decline and relevant loss in quality of life. The incidence of OA is rising due to the aging population and an increase in some risk factors, such as obesity. Knee OA is the most common OA localization, and symptomatic knee OA is highly prevalent among people aged over 50 years, affecting more than 250 million people worldwide.

Knee OA is a leading cause of pain in older people, and pain of the hip and knee results in physical disability and an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Hip and knee OA together are the eleventh highest contributor to global disability: the years of life lived with OA-related disability increased by 64% from 1990 to 2010 reaching 17 million. OA is a progressive disorder, with different degrees of severity, that requires long-term management with various treatment options over the course of the disease. The goals of treatment for OA are to reduce symptoms and ultimately slow disease progression, which may in turn reduce the impact of OA on the patient's mobility and quality of life, with consequent reduction in healthcare resource needs.

In 2019, the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) published recommendations for the management of knee OA in the form of a treatment algorithm that provides practical guidance for the prioritization of interventions and guides physicians through progressive, logical steps based on the severity of the knee OA signs/symptoms.

The management of knee OA is therefore demanded to several specialists, including general practitioners, rheumatologists, orthopedics and finally geriatricians. However, the exact role of geriatricians in the management of knee OA was poorly studied, whilst the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is widely used for preventing negative consequences in older people, such as hospitalization or mortality. Moreover, CGA can be used across different settings, from primary care to hospital, with similar beneficial effects in older people.

This transition period is the highest risk period for attempted and completed suicide. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of adolescent mortality, and there are currently no established interventions for suicidal teens. By developing a treatment that can be delivered on an inpatient unit prior to the transition to outpatient treatment, we anticipated being able to lower suicidal risk and increase the likelihood that participants will attend subsequent outpatient treatment. In keeping with the priorities of NIMH, this intervention aimed at reducing the risk of suicide and suicidal behavior was trans-diagnostic. We term the intervention ASAP, with anticipated components: (1) Adherence-promoting engagement and adherence to treatment through motivational interviewing; (2) Safety planning; and (3) Affect Protection- selecting from a menu of techniques for maintaining positive affect (e.g. savoring and switching strategies, mobilizing social support, engaging in emotion regulation and distress tolerance skills). Each of these components was delivered within a Motivational Interviewing framework for enhancing intrinsic motivation for change. Treatment was brief (3-5 hours), and flexibly delivered on inpatient units prior to initiation of outpatient treatment.

ASAP included the family in the treatment, and a safety plan phone app to extend the impact of treatment was also developed. Innovative features included: (1) delivery of an intervention at a time and place when suicidal risk is highest; (2) augmentation of protective factors against recurrent suicidal behavior, specifically by promoting development of positive affect, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and social support; (3) a Safety plan phone app to extend the impact of treatment; and (4) liaison with the outpatient therapist to ensure continuity of care.

The investigators hypothesize that the onset of effective analgesia (NRS pain \</= 1, in minutes) will be faster with the modified CSE compared to DPE.

Methodology:

Study Design: Randomized Double Blinded Clinical Trial.

Study Implementation:

Once participants are consented for the study, usual care is established with IV cannula insertion, fluid bolus and standard monitors will be applied. Participants will then be randomly assigned into two groups by a computer-generated randomization sequence. Group assignments will be concealed in opaque numbered envelopes and will be opened by the anesthesiologist performing the block immediately before initiation of analgesia. Group 1 will receive a modified combined spinal-epidural (MCSE) and Group 2 will receive a dural puncture epidural (DPE).

The epidural space will be located at the L2-3 or L3-4 interspace using a midline approach with a 17-G, 9 cm Touhy epidural needle using a loss of resistance technique. A single dural puncture with confirmation of free flow of CSF will be performed with a 25-G, 12 cm Whitacre needle placed through the epidural needle. Subsequent intervention varies with the group allocation.

MCSE group: 1 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected intrathecally DPE group: No medication will be injected intrathecally. Both the groups will subsequently have the epidural catheter placed 4-6 cm into the space and will be checked for a negative aspiration of blood/CSF. In the DPE group, 15 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine will be given as 5ml fractionated boluses. Both groups will have patient controlled epidural analgesia started after the study interventions as follows: Bupivacaine 1.25 mg/mL with fentanyl 2 microgram/ml, background infusion at 8 mL/h, demand dose of 4 mL, lockout interval of 20 minutes.

The anesthesiologist and nurse will be asked not to reveal the group assignment to the patient or study co-investigators so that the patients and the study investigators collecting the data will be blinded to the techniques. The anesthesiologist performing the technique will prepare the medications according to group allocation and will not be involved in any data collection. Attending, fellow or resident anesthesiologists will perform all the techniques.

After block completion, an independent blinded co-investigator will assess the numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores from 0-10 and other outcomes after the initial dosing, at the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minute marks. The time taken to achieve a NRS equal to or less than 1 will be recorded for all the three groups. Sensory levels will be assessed using ice starting caudad at the S2 dermatome and moving cephalad. Time taken to achieve a block of T10 will be recorded. Patients will be assessed for pruritus and nausea/vomiting every hour, by grading the severity on a scale ranging from 0-3; 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2= moderate and 3 = severe. Motor strength will be assessed hourly with a modified Bromage score (0 = full flexion of knees and ankles, 1 = partial flexion of knees, full flexion of ankles, 2 = inability to flex knees and partial flexion of ankles and 3 = inability to flex knees and ankles). Presence of motor blockade will be defined as modified Bromage score of more than or equal to 1. Following the first 30 minutes, assessments will continue at 60-minute intervals until delivery.

The participant will be monitored for hypotension and fetal bradycardia during this period and up to 1 hour after the procedure. Hypotension is defined as a 20% reduction in the systolic blood pressure from the admission blood pressure in the absence of uterine contraction and will be treated with vasopressors as per the standard of care. Fetal bradycardia is defined as a fetal heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute, persisting for more than 1 minute.

In the event of inadequate analgesia and a unilateral block defined by a difference of more than 2 dermatomal levels between the 2 sides, the participant will be placed on the less blocked side and a supplemental epidural dose will be administered. If the unilateral block persists, the catheter will be withdrawn 1 cm and an additional supplemental epidural dose of 5 ml 2% lidocaine will be given over 2 min. In the event of inadequate analgesia and the presence of inadequate sensory level bilaterally, supplemental epidural dose will be administered. If improvement of analgesia is not observed, the epidural catheter will be replaced.

Mode of delivery and fetal Agar scores will be recorded for all the patients. All the study subjects will be visited on postpartum day 1 and will be assessed for satisfaction with labor analgesia using a Likert scale and any potential complications such as headache, back pain, leg weakness or numbness and paresthesia.",UNKNOWN,,2018-01,2018-08,2018-08,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TRIPLE,TREATMENT,80,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Modified CSE"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""MCSE group: 1 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected intrathecally"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Dural puncture epidural"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""DPE group: Dural puncture performed, but no medication will be injected intrathecally."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",PROCEDURE;PROCEDURE,modified cse;dural puncture epidural,0
OTHER,NCT00703079,Impact of Somatostatin Analogs vs. Surgery on Glucose Metabolism in Acromegaly,"Impact of Somatostatin Analogs vs. Surgery on Glucose Metabolism in Acromegaly: Results of a 5 Years Observational, Open, Prospective Study","To investigate the 60 month impact of surgery and somatostatin analogues (SSA) on glucose metabolism in acromegaly we will analyzed data from 100 patients with acromegaly according with different treatments (group A=with SSA only; group B= SSA followed by surgery; group C= surgery only; group D= surgery followed by SSA). At diagnosis and after 6-12 and 60 months were analyzed as primary outcome measure changes in fasting glucose and as secondary outcome measures changes of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin levels, HOMA-R and HOMA-β, representing insulin resistance and β-cell function, respectively.

We will enrol 100 patients and expect half of them to have IGT or diabetes mellitus. We do not expect changes according with different treatment after 60 months while SSA-treated patients might experience deterioration of glucose tolerance after 6-12 months. We intend to look for predictors of deterioration of glucose tolerance.","Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and overt diabetes mellitus are frequently associated with acromegaly. Patients with acromegaly are insulin resistant both in the liver and in the periphery, displaying hyperinsulinemia and increased glucose turn-over in the basal post-absorptive states. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus and that of IGT in acromegaly is unknown but is reported to range 19-56% and 16-46% in different series. The increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with acromegaly may party be a consequence of the increased insulin resistance that frequently accompanies GH excess. Glucose tolerance may worsen in patients treated with somatostatin analogues (SSA), because insulin secretion, i.e. β-cell function, is also suppressed. SSA induce control of GH and IGF-I excess in approximately 60% of patients after 12 months of treatment with no significant difference as applied after unsuccessful surgery or as first-line in newly diagnosed patients and control of GH and IGF-I levels occur with an even higher prevalence after a longer period of treatment. The inhibitory effect of SSA on pancreatic insulin secretion might, however, complicate the overall effect of this treatment on glucose tolerance. We recently demonstrated that 12 months after first-line treatment with SSA or surgery produced a similar improvement in LV hypertrophy and diastolic filling while systolic function increased more evidently in SSA-treated patients, total/HDL-cholesterol ratio significantly reduced only in SSA-treated patients while fasting glucose levels significantly reduced only in surgery-treated patients. A normal pituitary function was found in 46.4% of SSA-treated and in 36.4% of surgery-treated patients, resulting unchanged in the former and slightly reduced in the latter. Both a direct effect of SSA and a more preserved pituitary function might explain these results. Longitudinal data of glucose tolerance in patients with acromegaly and with or without diabetes treated long-term with SSA or surgery or both are still very limited.

In order to investigate whether SSA negatively impact glucose tolerance in acromegaly, we will analyze data collected prospectively during a 10 year period. We will compare the results of glucose tolerance at diagnosis after 6-12 months and after 60 months of treatment with SSA or surgery. Patients will be grouped according with their treatment (SSA only, surgery only, SSA followed by surgery and SSA followed by surgery and SSA) in order to establish the effects on glucose tolerance mediated by disease control and type of treatment.",COMPLETED,,1997-01,2008-06,2008-06,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,100,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Octreotide-LAR or lanreotide"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Treated with octreotide-LAR will be given at dosages of 10-40 mg/q28d and treatment with lanreotide-SR at dosages of 60-120 mg/q28d.

OTHER,NCT03732079,Inferior Vena Cava Diameter and Postpartum Hemorrhage,The Correlation Between Inferior Vena Caval Diameter and the Volume of Postpartum Blood Loss,"Excessive bleeding after normal birth or cesarean section is defined as blood loss of 1000 mL or more (clinically estimated) within 24 hours after birth. It occurs in about 5% among postpartum women. Postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women giving birth. Postpartum hemorrhage may lead to hemorrhagic shock, renal failure, respiratory failure, need for surgical intervention, blood transfusion and hysterectomy.

The cornerstone of effective treatment is rapid diagnosis and intervention in time. However, in a number of cases there is an underestimation of the volume of blood loss which may lead to delay in diagnosis and treatment. The consequences are even graver in women who delivered by a cesarean section, since unlike a normal birth in which the bleeding is external and visible, the bleeding is usually intra-abdominal, and so the delay in diagnosis may be even longer.

The Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) is a flexible blood vessel sensitive to intravascular blood volume, and its diameter varies accordingly. Its diameter reflects the pressure in the right atrium, which is a measure of the cardiac preload. A number of studies have shown that the IVC diameter changes, before the variations in vital and clinical signs.

Recently, IVC diameter has been assessed as an assessment of intravenous fluid balance in hemodynamically stable patients with a risk of sub-volume shock. The authors concluded that the IVC measurement is a good noninvasive method, compared to catheter insertion into the right atrium, and it is available as a bedside procedure.

In obstetrics the use of IVC to determine blood loos was not widely examined and there is no information regarding the use of IVC diameter as a predictor or as a detection method of postpartum bleeding.

In this study the investigators aim to examine the correlation between IVC diameter and the volume of postpartum blood loss.",,UNKNOWN,,2018-11-10,2019-04-30,2019-04-30,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,108,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Ultrasound"", ""type"": ""DIAGNOSTIC_TEST"", ""description"": ""Ultrasound to measure the IVC diameter.

OTHER,NCT04499079,Alliances to Disseminate Addiction Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT),Alliances to Disseminate Addiction Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT): A Statewide Learning Health System to Reduce Substance Use Among Justice-Involved Youth in Rural Communities,"Youth involved in the juvenile justice system (YJJ) bear a disproportionate burden of the addiction crisis. YJJ substance use (SU) is extremely prevalent, with a third of YJJ meeting criteria for a substance use disorder (SUD). The investigators seek to address the national addiction crisis at its epicenter.

Despite their high need for SUD services, and the proliferation of evidence-based interventions to reduce SU, YJJ are rarely connected to needed, high-quality SU care. A care cascade model highlights gaps in YJJ achieving the full continuum of SUD care (i.e., SUD risk identification, treatment referral, treatment initiation, and treatment engagement). YJJ on community supervision/probation face a unique problem accessing SUD services; while the courts or probation may identify YJJ need for SUD care, YJJ must receive care through healthcare agencies in the community. The primary goal of the project, Alliances to Disseminate Addiction Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) is to address this and other gaps along the care cascade for YJJ. The investigators will accomplish this goal by creating alliances between the juvenile justice system (JJ) agencies and community mental health centers (CMHCs) in eight Indiana counties.

ADAPT takes a two-pronged approach. First, the investigators will employ a Learning Health System (LHS) to develop collaborative alliances between JJ agencies and CMHCs, organizations that traditionally operate independently. Second, the investigators will present local Cascade data during continuous quality improvement cycles within the LHS alliances. By offering agency representatives an opportunity to view and discuss, for example, the local rate at which YJJ with SUD risk are initiating CMHC SU services, the investigators will facilitate development of tailored, local solutions to improve the Cascade for each county's YJJ.

To maximize long-term sustainability of ADAPT's JJ-CMHC alliances, the investigators will conduct this research in collaboration with leaders from an existing statewide initiative, the Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI). JDAI is a juvenile justice reform effort that utilizes data-driven decision-making and is implemented in almost 300 counties across the US. If this project is successful, the JDAI infrastructure and support for this research will inform sustainment and expansion across Indiana and the nation.

The investigators hypothesize that ADAPT - novel LHS alliances using Cascade data to implement localized solutions to YJJ receiving evidence-based addictions care - will positively impact SU and recidivism outcomes over time. The investigators seek to complete the following specific aims:

AIM 1: Implement LHS alliances between JJ agencies and CMHCs. The investigators will establish LHS alliances: novel, collaborative partnerships between JJ agencies and CMHCs.

AIM 2: Generate and track local solutions to address gaps in the Cascade for YJJ in rural Indiana counties. Quantifying local Cascade data will enable JJ agencies and CMHCs to suggest and implement tailored, evidenced-based interventions, which will be tracked through LHS quality improvement cycles.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Are both doses of PRS CK STORM (dose A and dose B) safe as an intravenous drug to modulate inflammatory processes, such as the cytokine storm for the treatment of ARDS caused by SARS-Cov-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV?
* Are both doses of PRS CK STORM (dose A and dose B) effective as an intravenous drug to modulate ARDS-associated cytokine storm caused by SARS-Cov-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV compared to the control group?
* What are the anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles after treatment with two different doses of PRS CK STORM in participants hospitalized for ARDS caused by SARS-Cov-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV?

Researchers will compare both doses of PRS CK STORM with the control group to test whether the anti-inflammatory action of PRS CK STORM is safe and effective in modulating the cytokine storm for the treatment of ARDS caused by SARS-Cov-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV. In addition, the anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles after treatment PRS CK STORM compared to placebo group in these participants will be also studied.","This is a double-blind, randomized, phase I/II pilot clinical trial of two doses of PRS CK STORM in hospitalized adult participants with ARDS caused by SARS-Cov-2, influenza A, influenza B and RSV All participants will receive the standard of care for ARDS, according to its viral origin:

* Clinical management of COVID-19: hospital care (Centro de Coordinación de Alertas y Emergencias Sanitarias, 2020).
* Clinical practice guidelines for influenza (WHO, 2024). Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized in blocks to reach the 2:2:1 ratio (dose A: dose B: placebo).

This study consists of two parts:

Part 1: Two different doses (A and B) of PRS CK STORM will be evaluated in 2 groups of 4 participants (3:1; PRS CK STORM: placebo). It starts with a first sentinel group of 4 participants who will be assigned to placebo or study drug dose A. First, only 2 participants will randomly be assigned to receive the active treatment of dose A or placebo for 5 consecutive days. These 2 first participants will be followed up to 48h after the last drug administration (short-term safety follow-up period) when a safety assessment will be completed before treating the other 2 participants in this group.

If the study drug is considered safe during the short-term safety assessment planned 48h after the last drug administration, then 2 additional participants will be treated with dose A for 5 consecutive days to complete the first sentinel group of 4 participants. These 2 participants will be followed up to 48h after the last study drug administration before moving to dose B.

After the assessment of data collected follow-up for this first group, a second small sentinel group of other 4 participants will be treated with a higher dosage (dose B) following the same process: firstly, only 2 participants will randomly receive the active treatment of dose B or placebo for 5 consecutive days and then these 2 first participants will be followed up to 48h after.

If the study drug is considered safe during the safety assessment planned 48h after last drug administration, then two additional participants will be treated with dose B for 5 consecutive days to complete the sentinel second group of 4 participants evaluating dose B. These 2 participants will be also followed up to 48h after the last study drug administration before moving to Part 2.

All these 8 participants included in Part 1 will continue in a long-term safety follow-up period until 1 year post treatment.

Part 2: 42 additional participants will be treated for 5 consecutive days. These 42 participants will be randomized to three treatment arms: 17 in the active arm with dose A, 17 participants in the active arm with dose B and 8 participants in the placebo arm. All participants in Part 2 will be followed up to 48h after the last study drug (short-term safety follow-up period). Once all participants treated in Part 2 finished the short-term safety follow-up period (48h after last study drug administration), all data will be verified and statistically analyzed in an interim analysis. All participants will be followed up to 1 year post treatment (long-term safety follow-up period). Therefore, considering the participants enrolled in Part 1 and Part 2 the total number of participants for safety, tolerability and efficacy analysis will be 50 assigned to three different arms (total randomization ratio 2:2:1), 20 participants will receive dose A, 20 participants will receive dose B and 10 participants will receive placebo.

To sum up, considering the participants enrolled in Part 1 and Part 2 the total number of participants for safety, tolerability and efficacy analysis will be 50 assigned to three different arms (total randomization ratio 2:2:1), 20 participants will receive dose A of PRS CK STORM, 20 participants will receive dose B of PRS CK STORM and 10 participants will receive placebo.

The estimated duration of the study for individual participants will be 12 months (screening: 3 days, treatment period: 5 days, short-term safety follow-up period: 2 days after the last drug intake and long-term safety follow-up period: up to 48 weeks from randomization).

TXA suppresses the viability of multiple human/murine cancer cell lines and Plasmin formation, which prevents cleavage of the CDCP1 protein to a more oncogenic form.

Uptake by cancer results in blockade of protein synthesis, and alter signaling through the amino acid-sensitive mTORC1/S6K1 and GCN2/eiF2a/ATF4 pathways.

The Action Observation (AO) evokes an internal, real-time motor simulation of the movements that the observer is perceiving visually. Both mental processes trigger the activation of the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie the planning and execution of voluntary movements in a manner that resembles how the action is performed in a real manner.

Both observation and imagination share a great number of common mental processes based primarily on sensory perception, and the information stored by memory systems. The activation of the motor command during a mental practice does not induce an active movement probably due to an inhibitory mechanism in the primary motor cortex on the descending corticospinal tract pathways. However, this inhibition is not complete, for it is well known that the training of mental practice involves a component of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).

It has been shown that both MI and AO lead to changes in the ANS that cause excitatory sympathetic responses, although the neurophysiological bases remain uncertain and are still based on hypotheses. The functional relations between both neurocognitive processes and the sympathetic-excitatory nervous system (SNS) could be based on a preparation phase in which, the activation of the SNS, happens to a near effort and, therefore, to a close energy expenditure in physiological processes (i.e., cardiorespiratory adaptationse) which will take place in order to face said metabolic changes produced by the voluntary movement itself. In addition, several hypotheses have been described regarding the notion that the SNS not only has the quantitative objective of providing energy to the muscle effectors, but that it also qualitatively and specifically designs and adapts the parameters on demand in an attempt to save the energy provided for each precise motor execution.

Taking into account that both MI and AO cause sympathetic-excitatory changes that induce an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, electrodermal activity , our hypothesis is that the combination of MI and AO induces an autonomic sympathetic-excitatory shift greater than MI does in isolation. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to compare the results obtained from intervention groups on the subject of the activation of the SNS in a program that combined MI with AO, in contrast to an isolated MI program on the one hand in asymptomatic subjects and in the other hand in patients with chronic low back pain..

1. Determine the prevalence of Helicobacter infection in Myanmar (this would be the largest ever series in the country)
2. Determine the clinical and epidemiological associations of Helicobacter infection in Myanmar
3. Determine the utility of stool antigen testing to diagnose the infection and confirm eradication
4. Compare the relative efficacies of concomitant and sequential therapy
5. Determine the relative efficacies of first, second and third line therapies in Myanmar in 2018","There are very few published studies to examine the prevalence of Helicobacter infection in Myanmar. Two previous studies (both \< 400 participants) suggested that the prevalence was approximately 50% (Myint WJG 2015, Aye MMJ 2015).

The high prevalence of H.pylori is important because gastric adenocarcinoma is the fourth most common cancer in the country (WHO 2014). Gastric cancer has an almost uniformly dismal 5-year survival rates in this resource-limited country and is estimated to kill almost 5000 patients per year in Myanmar (WHO 2014).

In addition, anecdotally there is a significant associated burden of peptic ulcer disease in the country, although there are few published data to examine the issue.

Strategies to diagnose and eradicate H.pylori must be considered in the context that the annual per capita health budget is USD103 (World Bank 2016).

Therapeutic regimens must also consider the issue of antimicrobial resistance, which varies from country to country. There are very few data from Myanmar to guide us and those that are available vary enormously.

In vitro antibiotic resistance by agent

Amoxycillin 0%, 8%, 7%

Metronidazole 33%, 54%,100%

Clarithromycin 0%, 13%, 50%

Levofloxacin 6%, NR, 3%

Tetracycline 0%, NR, NR

Ciprofloxacin 6%, NR NR

Studies: Mahachai 2012, Aye 2005, Aye 2014

However, it is also known that in vitro resistance does not necessarily translate into in vivo failure. Furthermore in a resource poor setting like Myanmar, a strategy of susceptibility guided treatment is not feasible. Indeed, this is not likely to be cost-effective in even wealthy countries (ACG guidelines 2017 and Maastricht consensus guidelines 2017).

The current first line therapy for H.pylori in Myanmar is 10-14 days of concomitant bd PPI + bd Clarithromycin + bd Amoxycillin + bd metronidazole. This regimen contains up to 126 pills (14 days) and costs up to USD16 (14 days). It is likely that 14 days of 4 drug therapy will generate issues with side effects and adherence, although again this has not been examined locally.

Alternatively, a 10-day sequential regimen of 5 days of bd PPI + Amoxycillin, then 5 days of bd PPI + Clarithromycin and Tinidazole reduces the pill load to 50 pills and the total drug cost to USD6. This regimen has been shown to be highly effective in Slovenia (94.2%), Portugal (90%), Belgium (90%), Israel (95.9%), Thailand (94%), Taiwan (91.9%), Singapore (90.3%), and the United Arab Emirates (88.6%) (Review, De Francesco 2017).

A sequential regimen has been shown to have less satisfactory success rates in Greece , Spain, Ireland, Turkey, Iran, Korea, China, and Puerto Rico (although in many of these studies, metronidazole was used instead of tinidazole (Review, De Francesco 2017)).

The current second-line regimen in Myanmar is 10-14 days of bd PPI + Levofloxacin + Amoxycillin (pill load 80 pills for 10 days, total cost USD3). In this era of evolving drug resistance, we may not want to use quinolones as first line therapy however.

The current third line therapy is Bismuth based quadruple therapy (BQT). This regimen is comprised of Bismuth + PPI + Tetracycline + Tinidazole (pill load 120 pills, total cost USD50)

The proposed study aims to demonstrate that a 10-day course of sequential therapy is not inferior to 14 days of 4 drug concomitant therapy. Assuming a cure rate of 80% for Concomitant 4 drug therapy, and an inferiority bound of 10%, the sample size is 626 (313 patients in each arm). To identify 626 patients, we will need to screen approximately 1250 patients. In this resource-poor setting, diagnosis will be established using monoclonal stool antigen testing (SAT BioMerieux BioNexia). Patients who test positive with SAT will be randomised 1:1 in an open label study to either a 10-day course of sequential therapy or the current first line regimen of concomitant 4 drug therapy. Four weeks after completing therapy, eradication will be confirmed with repeat SAT.

Those patients failing the first line therapy would then receive second line levofloxacin and then tested to confirm eradication. This would determine the efficacy of the country's current second line therapy.

Finally, patients failing first and second line therapy would receive the more involved and expensive third line therapy. Once again, this would determine the efficacy of third line therapy.

To ensure all participants had their H.pylori infection eradicated, those failing three lines of therapy would be offered endoscopy and culture directed therapy.

The performance of the stool antigen test is affected by the PPI therapy, so the study can't easily enrol patients presenting with acute symptoms who will frequently have already been taking PPI therapy (higher rate of false negatives). Therefore, the study will enrol outpatients about to commence aspirin, NSAIDs or anticoagulants (in whom the risk of GI bleeding is higher) or patients with a personal history of peptic ulcer disease or family history of gastric cancer. These are all indications for H.pylori testing (ACG guidelines 2017 and Maastricht consensus guidelines 2017).

We investigated the incidence of DTI using the GlideScope® videolaryngoscope (GVL) with an algorithm based on a pre-operative assessment with the El Ganzouri Risk Index (EGRI).

METHODS We prospectively enrolled morbidly obese patients (BMI\>40 kg/m2) undergoing abdominal surgery. Patients were scheduled for flexible fibre optic bronchoscopic intubation (FFBI) or GVL intubation if the EGRI score was ≥7 or \<7, respectively. The primary outcome was the occurrence of DTI that was defined as Cormack and Lehane (C\&L) grades ≥III, Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS)\>5 and modified IDS (mIDS)\>5. A numeric rating scale (NRS) was also used. Secondary outcomes included intubation success during the first attempt, the time to Cormack (TTC), the time to intubation (TTI), failure to intubate, oxygen desaturation and difficult ventilation.","The EGRI, a multivariate risk index that combines seven variables associated with DTI, was evaluated in all patients during the pre-anaesthesia visit. The results were reported in the clinical chart. All tracheal intubations in obese patients needing surgery were routinely performed using GVL. The intubations were performed or assisted by five board-certified anaesthesiologists who had prior experience with at least 20 GVL intubations, as well as at least two years of experience with anaesthesia in obese patients. In cases where the GVL intubation was performed by anaesthesiologists that were in training, the GVL expert was actively advising the operator during all of the intubating procedures. The standard equipment included a GVL with blade number three to five and an orotracheal hockey stick tube with a malleable single-use stylet (Fr 14, Intubating Stylet, DEAS). The standard anaesthesia induction started with 3-5 minutes of pre-oxygenation using 5 cm H2O PEEP in a 30° head-up position, as well as induction with fentanyl 3 μg kg -1 (LBW), propofol 2-3 mg kg -1 (LBW) and suxamethonium 1 mg Kg -1 (TBW). When spontaneous respiration ceased, the patient was mask ventilated with 100% oxygen. The tube was lubricated and advanced into the mouth under direct visual guidance to avoid complications, and then, under indirect visual guidance using the GVL monitor. The correct placement of the cuffed tube was verified using a capnograph and a stethoscope. The tube sizes were 7.0 for women and 7.5 for men. Each patient was monitored using an electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial blood pressure measurement, and pulse oximetry before both tracheal intubation and anaesthesia induction. The basic demographic data and airway characteristics necessary to evaluate the primary outcome and to calculate the EGRI score were registered prior to anaesthesia. Patients with an EGRI score of 7 or higher were scheduled for elective fibre optic flexible bronchoscopic intubation (FFBI), while patients with an EGRI score of less than 7 underwent anaesthesia induction and GVL intubation, according to a predefined algorithm",COMPLETED,,2012-03,2014-04,2014-04,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,195,ACTUAL,[],,,1

Ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamine, and citrate are commonly used as nutritional supplements specially by athletes to increase muscle strength. They can be mixed with formula or other foods.","Propionic acidemia is caused by deficiency of propionyl CoA carboxylase that impairs the supply of succinyl CoA to the citric acid (Krebs) cycle. The Krebs cycle is responsible for obtaining energy from food in the form of ATP. ATP is essential for muscle contraction and correct functioning of all organs including the hearth, the kidney, and the pancreas.

Patients with propionic acidemia develop hyperammonemia at birth that recurs during episodes of metabolic decompensation. We found that plasma levels of the amino acids glutamine/glutamate are reduced in patients with propionic acidemia and decrease, rather than increase (like in urea cycle defects or other types of hyperammonemia) with hyperammonemia. Since alpha-ketoglutarate is the main source of endogenous glutamate/glutamine synthesis, our hypothesis is that chronic hyperammonemia and progressive dysfunction of multiple organs in patients with propionic acidemia is due to a functional insufficiency of the citric acid (Krebs) cycle with defective production of alpha-ketoglutarate. The basic deficiency of intermediates of the Krebs cycle can decrease production of ATP and explain the low muscle tone, progressive organ dysfunction, and poor long-term outcome of patients with propionic acidemia.

To test this hypothesis, we will test whether dietary supplementation with alpha ketoglutarate precursors (in the form of ornithine alpha ketoglutarate, glutamine or citrate) can improve plasma ammonia and overall outcome in patients with propionic acidemia. In this study, a limited number of patients (3) with propionic acidemia will be given the 3 different nutritional supplements and studied at regular intervals to see whether their glutamine/glutamate levels improve and if they have fewer episodes of hyperammonemia or acute decompensation. The supplement that produces the best increase in plasma glutamine levels will be tested for an additional 30 weeks. Children's development and motor skills will be tested before and after therapy to see if there is any improvement. The study will be conducted on outpatients at the University of Utah Clinical Research Center. If the initial trial is successful, we will try to launch a national trial involving multiple centers in the US and abroad to involve the largest number of patients possible.

The current therapy of propionic acidemia is based on restriction of precursors of propionic acid (methionine, valine, isoleucine, threonine, odd chain fatty acids, cholesterol) and administration of carnitine to help remove toxic organic acids. This therapy is not effective in preventing the long-term complications of the disease, even in children identified at birth by newborn screening. This research will test a completely new way of treating patients with severe and disabling metabolic disorders using replacement of downstream products involved in the generation of energy (ATP).

Study investigators will collect sociodemographic, clinical, immune activation, systemic inflammation, plasma and stool microbiome, and clinical pulmonary and cardiovascular disease measures. Our outcomes of interest are measures of carotid atherosclerosis, including carotid intima media thickness and presence of plaque, prior ischemic heart disease (as measured by electrocardiograms), peripheral arterial disease (as measured by ankle-branchial index), and lung function as measured by pulmonary function testing. Our exposures of interest are traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g. age, gender, family history of cardiovascular disease, smoking history, diet, activity, body mass index, prevalence of diabetes, and prevalence of hypertension) and HIV-related cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. nadir CD4 count, ART duration and regimen, gut and plasma microbiome composition, and markers of both immune activation and systemic inflammation).

Investigators will collect this data to accomplish the following aims:

Aim 1: Compare the prevalence of atherosclerosis, measured by cIMT, ankle-brachial index, and presence of q-waves on electrocardiogram, in PLWH taking ART aged 40 and older and age and gender-matched, population-based HIV-uninfected controls. This study aims to be among the first to capture high-quality measures of atherosclerotic disease among a population of PLWH in sub-Saharan Africa. The study aims to test the hypothesis that older-age Ugandans on ART will have thicker carotid intima media, higher prevalence of peripheral arterial disease, and higher prevalence of pathologic q-waves on electrocardiogram than age and gender-matched, HIV-uninfected controls.

Aim 2: Evaluate correlates of atherosclerosis in older-age PLWH on ART, including both traditional (age, gender, smoking, diabetes and hypertension prevalence) and HIV-related risk factors (immune activation, systemic inflammation, and stool and plasma microbiome composition). The study will leverage a collaboration with the Ragon Institute to perform immunologic and molecular testing for microbial translocation and markers of immune activation and systemic inflammation (e.g. soluble CD163, C-reactive protein, IL-6, CD8+ T-lymphocyte activation).

Aim 3: Compare the progression of atherosclerosis in PLWH versus HIV-uninfected individuals over five years of observation time. The study aims to test the hypothesis that the rate of change in carotid intima media thickness will be faster in among PLWH over 45 on ART than age and gender-matched HIV-uninfected controls, and that rates of change in carotid intima media thickness among the HIV-infected cohort will be associated with markers of microbial translocation, immune activation, and systemic inflammation.

Aim 4: Compare the prevalence and incidence of abnormal pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC) in PLWH on ART and age- and gender-matched, population-based HIV-uninfected controls, utilizing handheld spirometry with bronchodilator challenge.

OTHER,NCT00212979,Measuring Kidney Function in Kidney Transplantation,The Accurate Prediction of Renal Function in Kidney Transplant Recipients,"Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for permanent kidney failure. Following transplantation, the kidney function must be followed closely to detect problems so that investigations and appropriate treatment can be started early. Currently, function is monitored with the use of serum creatinine. In clinical trials involving kidney transplant recipients, markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine, are increasingly being used as outcomes to evaluate new treatments. However, serum creatinine is not very accurate or sensitive at detecting change in kidney transplant function. Newer methods of evaluating kidney function, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation and cystatin C, are known to be accurate markers of function in patients with non-transplant kidney disease. This study will compare the MDRD estimate and cystatin C estimate of kidney function with an accepted method (radioisotope clearance study) of measuring true kidney function in 250 renal transplant patients. Each patient will have 2 measurements made at least 3 months apart to determine the accuracy and responsiveness to change over time for the MDRD equation and cystatin C. If the results demonstrate that these new methods are accurate then clinical care and research studies involving transplant patients will be greatly enhanced. Patients and physicians would have a simple test that could detect problems earlier and more precisely monitor response to treatment leading to improved outcomes for renal transplant recipients.","Background and Hypothesis:

Short-term outcomes in renal transplantation, such as the acute rejection rate, have improved dramatically over the past decade. Unfortunately, this success has made it more difficult to evaluate new therapies in kidney transplantation. Markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine and creatinine clearance, are now being used to evaluate kidney transplant function. However, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance have many limitations and correlate poorly with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula has been shown to be very accurate at predicting GFR in patients with kidney disease who don't have renal transplants. Cystatin C, a novel marker of renal function, has also been shown to be accurate in transplant and non-transplant patients. However, the MDRD formula and cystatin C have not been properly validated in a large sample of renal transplant recipients.

Objectives:

The primary objective of this study is to determine if the MDRD formula accurately predicts GFR in renal transplant recipients. Secondary objectives of the study will determine whether: the MDRD formula is responsive to change in GFR over time, cystatin C accurately predicts GFR, or the MDRD formula is more accurate than other estimating equations in renal transplant recipients.

Research Plan:

A prospective cohort design will be used. Eligible adult renal transplant recipients at least 3 months post-transplantation will have serum creatinine, albumin, urea, cystatin C, 24-hour urine excretion of urea, 24-hour urine excretion of creatinine, 24-hour urine excretion of protein and GFR measured at study entry and at least 3 months later. GFR will be measured using 99Tc-DTPA. Estimates of the GFR will be made with the MDRD equation and other estimating equations. Renal function will also be assessed by measuring the urinary creatinine clearance and the combined urea and creatinine clearance. The primary analysis will determine the accuracy (proportion of GFR estimates that lie within 30% of measured GFR) of the MDRD equation. Secondary analyses will be performed to determine the bias (mean difference between the measured GFR and estimated GFR) and precision (standard deviation of the difference between the measured and estimated GFR) of the MDRD equation as well as the bias and precision of the change in GFR over twelve months. Similar analyses will be performed for cystatin C and other estimating equations.

Importance of Study:

New methods to accurately measure GFR are needed for both clinical care and research studies involving renal transplant recipients. As new therapies and immunosuppressive strategies become available, a simple and accurate means (such as the MDRD equation) to assess response to therapy will be invaluable. Markers of kidney function (serum creatinine, predicted GFR) are already being used in clinical trials involving renal transplant recipients without appropriate evaluation. The proper validation of equations to predict GFR in transplant recipients must be carried before they can be widely accepted in practice or for use in research protocols. If this study shows that the MDRD equation (or other marker of kidney function) is accurate in transplant patients then we can confidently move forward and use these validated measures of GFR in patient care and future research studies.",COMPLETED,,2004-04,2006-10,2006-10,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,250,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""non intervention study"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER,non intervention study,1

Therefore, management outside hospital, especially the regular administration of drugs, is vital to prevent the recurrence of cardiovascular events. However, most patients often fail to stay on a long-term administration regimen, especially the administration of statins.

It was found in previous studies that there were many factors influencing patients' compliance, in which patients' refusing to take medicine accounted for a higher proportion. It suggests that patient had not recognized the importance of long-term administration. Therefore, it is extremely important for physicians to strengthen patient education and regular follow-up visits during disease management. Moreover, the effectiveness of patient education during chronic disease management has already been proved in some studies abroad, and the interventional effect of multiple patient education process outweighs that of single approach education.

MEASUREMENT TOOLS

Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) Questionnaire that measures the impact that Fibromialgia has on the daily life of the patient. It is responsible for evaluating three items: functionality of the subject, overall impact of the disease and symptomatology. It was developed in 1980 by Drs. Carol Burckhardt, Sharon Clark and Robert Bennett Portland, Oregon USA. Published 1991, revisions 1997 - 2002 - 2009. It is one of the most used tools for evaluation of patients with FM. It consists of 10 items. The first is the only one containing several sub-items (a-j), in number of 10, each with a rank of 4 points (from 0, always, to 3, never) according to a Likert scale. This item evaluates the functional capacity of the patient through questions about activities related to daily life: buy, drive, etc. The second and third items correspond to numerical scales that refer to days of the week: the second on a scale from 1 to 7, and the third from 1 to 5. The rest of the items are valued using visual analogue scale (VAS) From 0 to 10. It was validated by Monterde in 2004.

Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scale that allows to measure the intensity of pain, draws a line that divides from 0 to 10, on the left corresponds to the use of pain with the number 0, on the right is the maximum degree of pain corresponds to 10.

SAMPLING TECHNIQUE:

Patients were selected using a non-probabilistic sampling technique for consecutive cases.

STATISTIC ANALYSIS:

The t-test for independent samples and logistic regression will be used to evaluate the effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable. A value of p ≤ 0.05 shall be considered significant. The statistical package SPSS version 17.0 for Windows 7 will be used.

METHODS Allocation method: Consecutive incident patients will be included, those eligible for the study will be assigned to treatment groups using a pre-established allocation table, which was generated in the randomization module of the True Epistat statistical program.

DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY

1. Four visits are planned for the evaluation of subjects.
2. At the first visit, the subjects attend the consultation 12 of the Department of Rheumatology at the University Hospital ""Dr. José Eleuterio González ""where they are evaluated by a rheumatologist to confirm the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology of 1990 and 2010. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) will be applied at baseline and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
3. Once the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia has been made, at the same first visit, a joint ultrasound will be performed by Rheumatologist expert in the field, in order to evaluate the presence of synovitis only in those patients with Primary Fibromyalgia.
4. All patients included in the Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Study will continue with their standard established treatment for the disease and may receive salvage treatment for pain management if they so require.
5. On the second visit, 15 ml of blood sample will be taken through venipuncture. 4ml of serum will be stored in aliquots of 0.5mL each in a freezer at -80 ° C located in the laboratory of the Rheumatology Service, in order to determine basal levels of vitamin D. Levels of c-reactive protein and Sedimentation to correlate them with the clinical data of inflammation obtained to the interrogation. We will determine levels of serum calcium to rule out the possibility of hypercalcemia at the start of the study and as a safety measure. In the case of clinical suspicion of Fibromyalgia secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, the study of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies will be carried out. The Mini-Neuro-psychiatric Interview will be applied by an expert Psychiatrist from the UANL, previously trained to perform this task.
6. At the second visit, subjects will be randomized to placebo or 50,000 international units of Vitamin D3 weekly for 12 weeks. It should be noted that neither the Rheumatologist who performed the Fibromyalgia diagnosis nor the person who will be responsible for providing the placebo or the vitamin will know the contents of the capsules. A double-blind study is planned.
7. At week 6 of the study a telephone call will be made to all patients to assess adverse effects.
8. The third visit will be performed at week 12 of the study, subjects from both groups are again assessed through the FibromyalgiaImpact Questionnaire (FIQ) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A 15 ml blood sample will be taken to determine vitamin D levels as well as serum calcium levels for monitoring adverse effects.
9. After completing 12 weeks of vitamin D supplementation or placebo as appropriate. All subjects in the placebo group will have the option of receiving vitamin D3 supplementation 50,000 IU orally in capsules per week for 12 weeks and then on a fourth visit they will be given a 15ml blood sample to measure vitamin D levels. It means that the study will be opened to know the subjects who received placebo after having completed the first twelve weeks. The blood samples obtained will be stored in the Laboratory of the Department of Rheumatology only during the duration of the study.

* Assessment of the efficacy of the study treatment in the study population in terms of response rate, progression-free survival, failure-free survival and overall survival.
* Acquisition of further data to expand the data base on the toxicity of the study treatment.
* Assessment of the efficacy of the study treatment in biological risk groups.
* Assessment of response in terms of minimal residual disease. Number of patients and estimated duration Total no. of patients: 122 (\~29 with 17p deletion for first-line therapy, \~29 with 17p deletion for second- or higher-line treatment, \~65 fludarabine-refractory irrespective of 17p status).

Duration for each patient: Max. 12 weeks of treatment in three 4-week cycles, then up to two years maintenance treatment.","CLL refractory to therapy based on fludarabine or with 17p deletion has a poor prognosis. Patients with F-refractory CLL have a remission rate of 20% after various salvage regimens and a median overall survival (OS) of \<12 months (Keating et al., 2002a). CLL patients with 17p deletion have a median OS of 16 months after first-line treatment with fludarabine or FC in the CLL4 trial of the GCLLSG (Figure 2; Stilgenbauer et al., 2005b; Eichhorst et al., 2006).

Alemtuzumab is the most active single agent in fludarabine-refractory CLL, with remission rates of 30-40% and median OS of 16-28 months (Keating et al., 2002b, Rai et al., 2002). Furthermore, alemtuzumab is of proven efficacy in CLL with 17p deletion and the subcutaneous administration is as effective as the intravenous application (Stilgenbauer \& Döhner, 2002, Lozanski et al., 2004, Stilgenbauer et al., 2004).

However, the outcome of fludarabine-refractory CLL is still poor, owing to the facts that the majority of patients do not achieve a remission and that the average duration of remission is short. Therefore, the current trial aims at achieving: (i) a higher remission rate, by adding high-dose dexamethasone to alemtuzumab, and (ii) prolongation of remission duration and survival by alemtuzumab maintenance or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT). High-dose steroids have shown activity independently of 17p and p53 status, and are effective in debulking large lymph nodes, a weakness of alemtuzumab (Bellosillo et al., 2002, Thornton et al., 2003, Pettitt et al., 2006). Maintenance treatment with alemtuzumab improved remission duration in the CLL4B trial and allogeneic SCT resulted in disease control in high-risk CLL in the CLL3X trial (Wendtner et al., 2004, Dreger et al., 2005).

This is a prospective, open, multi-center Phase II study conducted by the Deutsche CLL Studiengruppe (DCLLSG; German CLL Study Group, GCLLSG). There will be only one treatment group and thus no randomization. The study will be conducted at approximately 40 investigation sites in Germany, Austria and France.

The study will be conducted according to the EG Directive on Good Clinical Practice, the German Arzneimittelgesetz (AMG, 12. Novelle) as well as - with respect to the local activities and regulations - to the corresponding laws in France and Austria.

A total of 122 patients (adults, males and females, in-patients and out-patients; 2 to 10 patients are expected to be recruited by each of the centers) will be recruited, with stratification by detailed diagnosis. The distribution of female and male patients is not relevant for the study as both sexes are affected by CLL and treatment effects are not different in both groups (GCP-V § 7, 2). Recruiting will stop when the 122th. patient has completed the first four-week cycle of treatment. The study will be concluded when the last patient has completed treatment with alemtuzumab according to this protocol. The retrieval of additional follow-up data may be appropriate to achieve mature data in the survival endpoints.

Subcutaneous alemtuzumab (30 mg) will be administered three times weekly (days 1, 3 and 5) along with oral dexamethasone (40 mg/day, days 1-4, every 2 weeks) for at least 4 weeks (corresponding to 12 doses of alemtuzumab, in case of treatment interruption this may take longer than 4 weeks) and, for patients who show at least SD, a maximum of 12 weeks (36 doses of alemtuzumab, in case of treatment interruption this may take longer than 12 weeks). Thereafter, maintenance therapy with alemtuzumab will be instituted for a maximum of two years. If CR (including bone marrow histology and imaging (chest X-ray and ultrasound, CT if indicated) is documented before week 12, i.e. after week 4 (12 doses of 30 mg alemtuzumab) or 8 (24 doses of 30 mg alemtuzumab), maintenance treatment with alemtuzumab will be instituted at this time point.

In this study it is recommended to start the dose of alemtuzumab directly at 30 mg. However, the dose of alemtuzumab can be increased gradually (3 mg day -2, 10 mg day -1 and 30 mg day 1, as in earlier studies), according to the investigators discretion.

Staging will be performed at inclusion to the study and after 12 doses of alemtuzumab (aim: at the end of Week 4), after 24 doses of alemtuzumab (aim: at the end of Week 8), and after 36 doses of alemtuzumab (aim: at the end of Week 12) of treatment. Patients showing progressive disease (PD) (according to NCI criteria) will be withdrawn from the study. If hematological or other toxicity is seen, treatment will be interrupted and the dose will be reduced according to the prescription information.

If after 12 weeks there is stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), then maintenance treatment will be given, with continued subcutaneous alemtuzumab (30 mg every 14 days). Patients for whom stem-cell transplantation is a realistic treatment option will be offered the possibility of receiving allogeneic stem-cell treatment in another clinical trial (CLLX2 or other GCLLSG trial). The latter will however only be offered if (1) the patient is eligible according to protocol and (2) a HLA-compatible donor is available who has given his/her informed consent. There should be a treatment-free period of at least 2 months before SCT, details are specified in the corresponding protocol.

Appropriate premedication and infection prophylaxis will be administered. After each disease staging (i.e. every three months during the maintenance phase), if there is SD, PR or CR, then patients will continue study therapy (alemtuzumab maintenance). Maintenance therapy will be stopped after two years.

During the study, continual monitoring of efficacy and toxicity will be performed. Early stopping rules will be applied if major intolerability is observed.

Response will be assessed by clinical examination, blood counts, clinical chemistry, chest X-ray (plain radiograph of the chest), ultrasound of the abdomen, CT scanning (if indicated), bone marrow cytology and histology (only in cases of possible CR), and assessment of MRD (for molecular response rate only). Time points for response evaluation according to NCI criteria will be after 12 doses, 24 doses, and 36 doses of alemtuzumab. For an uninterrupted treatment course, this will be after 4, 8 and 12 weeks respectively. (If treatment with alemtuzumab is interrupted, then the time points for all subsequent doses, assessments and other procedures will be delayed correspondingly; i.e., the number of doses is the determining factor for elapsed treatment time, and not the calendar date; see above, ""Staging will be performed..."".) Follow-up assessment will continue at three-month intervals for at least three years.

OTHER,NCT02052479,Insulin Differences Between African-American and Caucasian Female Adolescents With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS),Differences in Insulin Secretion and Insulin Sensitivity/Resistance in African-American and Caucasian Adolescent Females With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"The purpose of this research study is to see if there are differences between African-American and Caucasian girls with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in how their bodies respond to a type of sugar, called glucose, the body's main source of energy. PCOS is one of the most common endocrine disorders among females. Features can include anovulation (eggs are not released from the ovaries) resulting in irregular menstrual periods, excessive amounts of androgenic (male) hormones resulting in acne and hirsutism (excessive hair growth on the face and body), and polycystic ovaries (small sac-like structures \[cysts\] on your ovaries) seen on ultrasound. Girls with PCOS also have higher levels of insulin in their bodies (called hyperinsulinism) but are not able to use insulin very well (called insulin resistance) resulting in an increased risk of diabetes. Diabetes is when you have high levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood. Many studies have looked at how bodies respond to glucose and have shown that compared to Caucasians, healthy African-Americans produce much more insulin (hyperinsulinism) but are not able to use it as well (insulin resistance) in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose move from the blood into the muscles for the body to use as energy. PCOS is associated with increased levels of insulin (hyperinsulinism) and not being able to use it as well (insulin resistance). So we want to see if there is a difference in insulin production (secretion) and insulin resistance between African-Americans and Caucasians girls with PCOS. To do this, we will look at blood glucose and insulin levels in response to giving glucose in African-American and Caucasian girls who have PCOS. The results of this study may ultimately help to more effectively target treatment therapy in individuals with PCOS that have increased insulin secretion and/or increased insulin resistance.","PCOS is the most common endocrine abnormality of reproductive-aged women in the United States, affecting approximately 5 million women (1). The exact prevalence of PCOS in the adolescent population is unknown mainly attributed to the diagnostic challenge PCOS presents as the characteristics of normal puberty overlap with the signs and symptoms of PCOS (2). The key features of PCOS include menstrual irregularity, hyper¬androgenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound. However, clinical presentation may vary. It is a complex heterogeneous condition with life-long psychological, reproductive, and metabolic manifestations that impact a woman's health throughout her lifespan. PCOS is associated with major metabolic consequences including hyperinsulinism (i.e. increased insulin secretion), insulin resistance (i.e. decreased insulin sensitivity), obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, endothelial dysfunction, defective fibrino¬lysis, as well as endometrial carcinoma (3).

Particular disease processes show a predilection for certain racial and ethnic groups. African-American \[AA\] adults are at increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease mortality, and hyper¬tension compared to Caucasian \[CA\] adults. Past studies (4-9) have found that AAs have increased insulin secretion and decreased insulin sensitivity compared to their CA counterparts in adolescence and adulthood and even in childhood. These findings are secondary to the combination of increased insulin secretion and resistance with decreased insulin sensitivity and clearance noted in African-Americans. It is this combination of altered glucose metabolism that places AAs at increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity. It has been proposed that hyperinsulinism or increased insulin secretion is a compensatory response by the pancreatic β-cell to increased insulin resistance. However, it has also been speculated that it is insulin resistance that is the compensatory response occurring in response to insulin hyper-secretion caused by pancreatic β-cell dysregulation (10-11).

Hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance are known inherent features of PCOS. Several studies have demonstrated significant hyperinsulinism with insulin resistance and lowered insulin sensitivity in adolescents and adults with PCOS when compared to BMI-matched healthy control subjects (12-18). Marked differences in insulin sensitivity/resistance and PCOS phenotype have been reported in adults of different races/ethnicities with PCOS (19-23), however; other studies have refuted these claims (24-27). The objective of this study is to examine the differences in insulin secretion between AA and CA adolescents with PCOS. We will also examine differences in insulin sensitivity/resistance between AA and CA adolescents with PCOS.

Primary Aim: To determine the influence of racial/ethnic background on insulin secretion in adolescent females with PCOS.

Secondary Aim: To determine the influence of racial/ethnic background on insulin sensitivity/resistance in adolescent females with PCOS.

Hypothesis: AA adolescent females with PCOS will have increased insulin secretion and decreased insulin sensitivity (i.e. increased insulin resistance) compared to CA adolescent females with PCOS.

To address this hypothesis, we will utilize one of the gold standards endorsed by the American Diabetes Association that satisfactorily assess insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity/resistance. The method utilized in this study is the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal model analysis (MINMOD FSIVGTT) (28-32). Using the data that is gathered as part of our primary and secondary aims, we will also conduct an exploratory analysis to examine the influence of PCOS phenotype on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity/resistance and the influence of racial/ethnic background on PCOS phenotype.",TERMINATED,,2014-01,2015-06,2015-06,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,DIAGNOSTIC,12,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (FSIVGTT)"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER,frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (fsivgtt),0

It also states that the ideal cesarean section rate 10% to 15%, and a rate above 10% at the population level is ineffective in decreasing maternal and infant mortality. However, current cesarean rates are much higher than recommended, especially in developed western countries, and rates ranging from 14.8% (Israel) to 54.8% (Turkey) have been reported as of 2018. Turkey, with a rate of 54.8%, has the highest cesarean section rate among the reported data.

Cesarean delivery is common worldwide and presents many maternal and neonatal risks. While bleeding is the most serious of these risks, the women also experience severe pain and face problems with breastfeeding. The risk of a postpartum bleeding complication is reported to be 2.5 times higher in women who have undergone a planned cesarean section. The rate of experiencing any pain after a cesarean section has been reported as 77% to 92.7% while the incidence of moderate/severe pain is 15.2% to 52.2%. In addition, the probability of experiencing breastfeeding problems in the post-cesarean period is reported to be approximately 7 times higher.

The need for optimum care in the postpartum period in order to protect the health of both the mother and the newborn, and also to prevent the health problems that may develop in the short and long term has been emphasized. Appropriate interventions of the nurses who are in close contact with the women, the newborns, and the families during the postpartum period affect the quality of care significantly. Based on this information, the various effects of the post-cesarean use of an abdominal binder, which is a noninvasive nursing intervention, has been evaluated in the literature and shown to have various benefits in the management of postpartum complications and problems after cesarean section in women with various characteristics. A limited number of studies have reported that the use of an abdominal binder decreases pain but inconsistent effect on postpartum bleeding. However, there is no study evaluating the effect of abdominal binder use on breastfeeding success.

The study was planned as a randomized controlled interventional study with the women randomly divided into intervention (abdominal binder) and control groups. A preliminary application was used to determine the sample size of the study. Based on the power analysis performed with the data obtained, a total of 128 women were included in the study with 64 women in each group, at a confidence interval of 95%, power of 90%, and α level of 0.05.

Block random sampling method was adopted to recruit participants. In order to randomly assign the participants to the groups, a list of 1:1 random numbers was created with the software Research Randomizer (https://www.randomizer.org/) on the computer. Participants were assigned to groups by 8-block randomization method. Randomization was done by an expert statistical consultant who was not responsible for conducting the study. The determined randomization number of list was printed out separately and sealed in each envelope. The random number was hidden in sealed envelopes until participants approved to participate in the study. Writing the random numbers on the papers, placing them in the envelopes and opening the paper in the sealed envelopes were done by an independent volunteer who was not responsible for the conduct of the study. Those who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and approve to participate in the study was allocated to intervention (abdominal binder) group or control group according to the result of randomization. In order to prevent bias each participant in the groups was followed in different rooms from the other participants in the group to which they were assigned.

SPSS software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, v. 24.0) will be used to evaluate the data. Descriptive analysis will be calculated using mean and standard deviation, median and interquartile range for continuous variables, and percentage and frequency for categorical variables. Independent sample t-tests, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare any differences in socio-demographic data or outcome variables between groups. To determine the differences or changes between study group and control group (between group effects), within group effects (time), and the interaction effects (group x time), repeated measures analysis of variances (RM-ANOVA) and to compare the variables with two repeated measurements paired sample t-test will be applied when assumptions for parametric test are fulfilled. When the data cannot fulfill the assumptions of parametric test, Mann-Whitney U test will be applied to compare the differences between groups at each time interval while Friedman test will be used to determine the time effects within each group. Significant results are indicated if p-value of all statistical analysis is less than 0.05 for two-tailed test.

Research increasingly emphasizes the significance of such activities, particularly in the prevention and management of various health conditions (Martin, Richardson, Weiller, \& Jackson, 2004).A sedentary lifestyle is considered one of the most serious health issues faced by individuals in the modern world.Previous research has established high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as an effective method for enhancing cardiovascular health, sparking interest in the relationship between exercise intensity and cognitive function. Most studies to date have focused on treadmill and lower extremity ergometer exercises; however, evidence regarding the efficacy of high-volume upper extremity exercises in improving physical and cognitive performance among sedentary adults remains limited and inconsistent. Upper extremity motor function has been proposed as a potential biomarker for cognitive impairment and may contribute to distinguishing healthy aging trajectories. This study aims to compare the effects of high-volume and low-volume upper extremity exercise in sedentary adults, testing the hypothesis that one exercise regimen may be superior in enhancing both physical and cognitive performance, as well as cognitive function.","Engaging in regular, well-structured physical activities is a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle and constitutes a lifelong habit essential for sustaining overall health and well-being. Such activities have been increasingly recognized for their vital role in preventing and managing a wide range of health conditions, emphasizing their importance for both physical and mental health (Martin, Richardson, Weiller, \& Jackson, 2004). Conversely, a sedentary lifestyle has emerged as one of the most pressing public health challenges of the modern era, contributing significantly to the global burden of disease and highlighting the need for effective intervention strategies.

Among these strategies, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has gained widespread attention for its efficacy in improving cardiovascular health. This has, in turn, sparked growing interest in understanding the broader impact of exercise intensity, particularly its effects on cognitive function. However, much of the existing research has concentrated on lower extremity exercises, such as those performed on treadmills or ergometers, leaving a significant gap in the understanding of the benefits of upper extremity exercises. The role of high-volume upper extremity exercise in enhancing both physical and cognitive performance remains underexplored, with current evidence presenting inconsistent and conflicting findings.

Notably, upper extremity motor function has been identified as a promising biomarker for cognitive impairment. Its assessment may provide critical insights into distinguishing healthy aging trajectories from pathological cognitive decline. This connection underscores the potential importance of upper extremity exercises as a tool for both physical and cognitive health maintenance in sedentary populations.

The present study aims to address these gaps by comparing the effects of high-volume and low-volume upper extremity exercise regimens on sedentary adults. Specifically, the research seeks to test the hypothesis that one of these exercise modalities may offer superior benefits in enhancing physical performance, cognitive performance, and overall cognitive function.

* To determine whether the screening campaign offered to the general population has strengthened the relationship between community medecine and healthcare circuit coordination

Data of patients from vaccination center who agreed to participate to the screening campaign by using the medical device ""CONSULT STATION®"" will be analyzed.

In France, they are the second leading cause of death after cancer, with over 140,000 deaths each year.

The number of people with cardiovascular disease increases with the aging of the population, and strong social and territorial inequalities persist. Innovative cardiovascular risk factors screening campaign can have significant public interest, especially to raise awareness and diagnose a particular population which is not monitored by a physician on a regular basis.

The VACCIPREV project emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic. The founding idea was to use the time people spent in vaccination centers to raise awareness and to diagnose people, for some, never go to a health facility. Indeed, a portion of the population free of all medical conditions, of all ages, including young people without known comorbidities, then crossed the threshold of our institutions to get vaccinated.

VACCIPREV is part of a global territorial prevention will to propose to this population flow an innovative medical technology optimizing all stages of vaccination.

In association with a French company named ""H4D"", developing a connected teleconsultation booth (CONSULT STATION®), an independent health check was thus structured, in addition with two questionnaires given during the waiting phase before vaccination: one concerning tobacco dependance and the other assessing the sleep quality. This health check focuses on the early detection of cardiovascular risk factors. It is indeed a key issue for medical management and VACCIPREV allows to respond to this issue in an innovative and playful way.

The CONSULT STATION® (Class IIa medical device certified according to European Directive 93/42/EEC) offers 15-minutes assessment of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, BMI, but also the performance of visual tests. Accompanied by a caregiver in the process, the person gets in real time these different medical constants and thanks to a simple and graduated evaluation scale, a review of his results and a recommendation to visit his doctor if necessary. In case of potentially pathological results, and with the person's consent, contact informations (telephone/email) were collected to remotely assess the impact of this screening campaign.

VACCIPREV programme included an idependant medical check-up with the connected booth H4D, questionnaires of tabacco dependance and assessment of sleep quality and a remote assessment of their impact on the medical management of people with pathological constants. A telephone interview was carried out after a period of at least 3 months following the passage in the cabin to complete the medical questionnaire in order to evaluate changes in patients medical management. This included assessing the impact of the approach.

It was an observational study on data from an historic and prospective cohorte, multicentered national and not randomized. The study period was between 1st july 2021 and 1st july 2022.

The main objective of the study was to determine whether the innovative screening campaign has impacted the health management of the population.

OTHER,NCT06840379,Effect of Sertraline on Inflammation in Hemodialysis Patients with Depression: a Randomized Controlled Trial,Effects of Sertraline on C-Reactive Protein Serum Levels in Hemodialysis Patients Diagnosed with Depression,"Depression is a common mental health condition among patients undergoing hemodialysis and is associated with a lower quality of life, poor treatment adherence, and worse overall health outcomes. Chronic inflammation, as measured by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, is frequently seen in these patients and contributes to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in this population.

Sertraline, a widely used antidepressant, is effective in treating depression in hemodialysis patients and has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to evaluate whether sertraline can reduce inflammation, as measured by CRP levels, in hemodialysis patients diagnosed with depression.

This research is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at Nishtar Hospital, Multan. A total of 62 adult hemodialysis patients with depression will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or a placebo for 12 weeks.

Depression severity will be assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), a widely used tool for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms. HAM-D scores will be recorded at baseline, at weeks 4, 8, and 12 to evaluate changes in depressive symptoms over time.

CRP levels will also be measured at baseline and after 12 weeks to determine whether sertraline reduces systemic inflammation in these patients.

The hypothesis of this study is that sertraline treatment will significantly lower CRP levels compared to a placebo, potentially providing dual benefits-improving mood and reducing inflammation-related health risks in hemodialysis patients. The findings of this study could help improve treatment strategies for depression and inflammation in individuals undergoing long-term dialysis.","After obtaining ethical approval, eligible participants were recruited from the hemodialysis unit. The study purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits were explained, and written informed consent was obtained. Participants meeting inclusion criteria underwent baseline assessments, including demographic data, medical history, HAM-D scores, and blood sampling for CRP measurement. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or placebo using a computer-generated randomization sequence. The sertraline group initially received 25 mg/day, titrated up to a maximum of 100 mg/day over 4 weeks based on clinical response and tolerability. The placebo group received identical-looking tablets. Participants were monitored for 12 weeks, with follow-up visits every 2 weeks.

OTHER,NCT04415879,Effects of a N95 Respirator vs Cloth Mask on Exercise Capacity During Treadmill Exercise.,Effects of a N95 Respirator vs Cloth Mask on Exercise Capacity During Treadmill Exercise.,"This study intends to find out how a cloth mask may impact exercise capacity, to provide guidance for exercisers to adjust their expectations and training accordingly. The investigators plan to asses exercise capacity through estimated peak oxygen consumption (eVO2peak), oxygen saturation and level of perceived exertion during treadmill based exercise while wearing a cloth mask compared to exercising without a cloth mask. The potential significance of this study is to determine if subjects can exercise safely and if their exercise training needs to be adjusted while following the current recommendations of wearing a cloth mask in public. The degree of airflow limitation experienced will depend on the type and fit of the mask being worn, and inadequeate airflow could possibly result in CO2 re-breathing if all air was not fully discharged from the mask with each breath. This re-breathing of CO2 could potentially limit the workload leading to a detriment in performance, and increase in adverse symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain or shortness of breath that does not improve with rest.","If healthcare providers are going to recommend that individuals exercise with cloth masks, it is imperative that future research is conducted to evaluate the degree to which airflow can be limited during exercise by wearing a cloth mask. At the completion of the study, the investigators will have further understanding of the effects of face masks during treadmill based running. To the investigators knowledge this is the first study to assess the effects of wearing protective cloth mask on exercise capacity.

Hypothesis The null hypothesis HO states that exercising with a cloth mask will be inferior to the current standard of exercising without a facemask, limiting peak exercise when non-inferiority margin is 1 estimated metabolic equivalent ( eMET 3.5 mlO2\*kg-1\*min-1).

The alternative hypothesis H1 states that exercising with a mask will not be inferior to the current standard of exercising without a facemask, limiting peak exercise when non-inferiority margin is 1 eMET.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN \& METHODS Subject Recruitment: The investigators will recruit 20 subjects though the Cleveland Clinic. Inclusion Criteria: Healthy subjects age \> 18, Exclusion Criteria: Any long-term disease that would interfere with their ability to exercise safely, fever \>100.4 F, or pregnancy. Informed consent will be obtained by the CoPI, and need for medical clearance determined based on ACSM's 2015 preparticipation guidelines. To remain compliant with enterprise guidelines we will not be recruiting healthy subjects outside of the Cleveland Clinic staff at this time to avoid increase COVID-19 exposure risk. However, if the enterprise changes the guidelines we will expand our enrollment to include non Cleveland Clinic employees. Employees will not be solicited by direct initiation. Recruitment will involve only posted notice or general advertising that does not pressure employees into participating for fear of job loss, delayed promotion, or other influences from their superior.

Study Design: The study design is a prospective crossover non-inferiority trial where subjects will complete 3 separate graded exercise treadmill tests each time wearing either No Mask, N-95 Mask (3M), or Cloth Mask (Boco). The order of the mask worn will be randomly assign to minimize familiarization or training effect. All testing will be performed in a Cleveland Clinic facility following standardized COVID-19 screening precautions. The investigators will compare the data collected from each test to asses for differences between subject comfort, peak exercise capacity (eMET), heart rate response during exercise and recovery.

Testing: After completing the informed consent and being medically cleared, subjects will then perform a symptom limited graded exercise treadmill test using a modified Balke protocol with continuous 12-lead EKG monitoring. Exercise tests will be stopped if any significant cardiac arrhythmias occur or significant ST segment depressions develops. The test will be terminated if ST elevation (\> 1.0 mm), marked ST displacement (horizontal or downsloping of \> 2mm, measured 60 to 80 ms after the J point), moderate to severe angina, Signs of poor perfusion (cyanosis or pallor), Sustained ventricular tachycardia or other arrhythmia, including second or third decree AV block, that interferes with normal maintenance of cardiac output during exercise, or development of bunle-branch block that cnannot be distinguished from bentricular tachycardia. The modified Balke, which is a well-accepted treadmill protocol that keeps the speed constant and increases workload by grade. Subjects will rest for 3 minutes and resting heart rate, blood pressure, subjective perceptions of the face mask will be measured. Subjects then will walk at 0% grade at 3 miles per hour for 2 minutes. Elevation will be increased by 2% after the initial 2 minutes and by 1% each minute thereafter until the test is terminated. Heart rate, RPEand oxygen saturation will be measured with a pulse oximeter at baseline, last 5-10 seconds of each stage and the investigators will continue to monitor heart rate during recovery at 1, 3 and 5 minutes post exercise. The investigators will monitor each stage for perceived exertion, feelings of light headedness, anxiety, and discomfort. The test will also be terminated at the request of the subject or if any chest pain develops. The scale of measuring subjective perceptions instrument will be adminstereted after collecting 5 minutes of resting, end of the exercise test, and at 5 minutes post recovery. The graded exercise test will be performed once with No Mask, once with a 3M 8200 N-95 Respirator, and once with a Cloth Mask (Boco).

OTHER,NCT06693479,Could a Feedback Device Help Manage Work-related Shoulder Disorders?,Could a Feedback Device Help Manage Work-related Shoulder Disorders? - Protocol of a Mixed Methods Pilot Study,"Work-related shoulder pain is a common problem with significant socio-economic repercussions. The impact of these disorders on workers is considerable, particularly in terms of pain, disability and reduced quality of life. Several occupational factors may explain the onset of these disorders, such as changes in the work environment, physical demands, psychosocial factors specific to the occupational context and the age of workers. The lack of quantitative measurement tools to assess the physical demands of work over an extended period of time is sorely felt. Recently, our team developed a wearable feedback device, similar to a watch worn on the arm, which measures shoulder movements and muscle activity, transforming this real-time data into clinical indicators. These indicators provide immediate feedback to workers, enabling them to better understand the physical demands of their tasks and adapt accordingly. If this device proves effective in reducing physical demands, it could become a valuable tool for guiding workplace assessments and interventions. However, this device has not yet been tested on workers with shoulder pain. For this reason, a two-part pilot study is needed to understand user needs, assess ease of use and the feasibility of implementing the device. The first component will consist of a pilot clinical trial involving 42 workers suffering from shoulder pain, divided into two groups: one group will use the feedback device for 2 weeks, while the other group will continue to work without intervention. The second phase will analyze the experience of participants who have used the device.","The objectives of this pilot study are (a) to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the SWL in the workplace and conducting a large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) by assessing recruitment success, intervention adherence, acceptability of the technology, the research team's capacity to refine the SWL, and (b) to explore the SWL capacity to reduce disability, pain, work limitations, and physical work demands while increasing pain self-efficacy among workers with WRSDs.",RECRUITING,,2025-03-01,2026-07,2026-03,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,OTHER,42,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Shoulder watch load (SWL) feedback"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""During week 2 and 3 after randomization, the experimental group will undergo the intervention using the SWL, designed to monitor workers' physical work demands.

OTHER,NCT03329079,Engaging Rural Men With Mobile Technologies for Weight Loss,Engaging Rural Men With Mobile Technologies for Weight Loss: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Overweight and obese men in rural Northeast Nebraska are an unrepresented, at-risk group exhibiting rising rates of cardiovascular disease, poor access to preventive care, and a rural milieu that contributes to their sedentary physical activity and unhealthy diet. This study proposes to use a pragmatic randomized controlled trial and community engaged research approaches to 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a commercially available, smart phone self-monitoring app (premium-version) plus text-based coaching and daily weighing via Wi-Fi scale intervention for achieving weight loss, 2) determine preliminary efficacy of this intervention group to a comparison group receiving only a self-monitoring app (basic-version) in achieving the outcomes of weight loss (kilogram) and improved dietary and physical activity behaviors (secondary) at 6 months post-baseline, and 3) determine quantitative and qualitative indicators of community capacity to support a contextually relevant weight loss intervention. Eighty men (ages 40-69) with body mass index of 28 or higher, randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to intervention group or comparison group. Men will complete baseline assessments (weight, % body fat, body mass index height, blood pressure, health history, dietary intake, physical activity frequency/intensity) and receive orientation to the mobile technologies (app features, text messaging, Wi-Fi scale). Men will track their dietary intake, physical activity, and weight on the app for 12 weeks. After the 3-month intervention, post-measure assessments (weight, % body fat, BMI, dietary intake, PA frequency/intensity, technology usability surveys) will be collected at 3 and 6 months post-baseline. At 6 months post-baseline, two groups (n=8 each) of intervention completers will be purposively selected to share their perceptions of the intervention efficacy in an evaluative focus group. A community advisory board comprising local leaders within the men's social network, together with investigators and rural student nurses will guide community outreach efforts for study recruitment, implementation and evaluation. Study findings will be evaluated with the community to inform local dissemination, future intervention revision, and determination of community capacity for support of a larger clinical trial.","Obesity is a major public health problem that disproportionately affects rural men and promotes the development of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and cancer. This study proposes to evaluate a mobile self-monitoring application (app) with Wi-Fi scale and text messaging intervention (MT+: mobile technology plus) for achieving weight loss in overweight and obese rural men. This proposal aligns with 1) Healthy People 2020's aim to eliminate health disparities by increasing physical activity and reducing obesity in adults; 2) the NIH's strategic plan to prioritize obesity reduction research among underserved rural populations; and, 3) the NINR's strategic focus on technology to promote health. Sixty nine percent of rural men in Nebraska are overweight or obese with increasing prevalence during midlife 40-59 (40%) and older (36%). Rural men are more likely to smoke, be obese, be physically inactive, and have shorter lifespans (2 years) than urban men. Rural men are also more likely to be uninsured/underinsured, less likely to engage in preventive health services, and report overall poorer health than urban men. Despite the burden of obesity, no self-monitoring mobile technology interventions targeting weight loss in rural, U.S. males exist, though the investigators preliminary study demonstrated rural men will use mobile technology for eating and activity self-monitoring. Studies show self-monitoring as one of the most effective behavior-change techniques for weight loss. MT+ provides an accessible means of real-time self-monitoring support for targeting lifestyle behaviors that lead to weight loss.

The investigators propose a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a MT+ intervention for weight loss in overweight and obese men in a practical, real-life rural environment. This 6-month pilot RCT includes a 3-month intervention with 6-month post-baseline follow-up. The intervention group (n=40) will receive a 3-month MT+ intervention using a commercially available, premium-version mobile phone app with social comparison group, behavior change text messaging, and daily self-weighing via Wi-Fi scale. The comparison group (n=40) will receive the basic-version mobile phone app only (MT). Primary efficacy outcome will be loss of body weight (kg \& % body weight) at 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be improved diet and increased physical activity (PA). A multi-method formative evaluation of the intervention (student outreach, community advisory board (CAB), community capacity surveys, focus group, community dissemination) will occur across the study. Primary feasibility outcomes will include recruitment/retention rates and community resource development for program sustainment. The multi-modal feedback will help 1) facilitate recruitment of a hard-to-reach population, and 2) inform intervention feasibility and acceptability. These local insights may foster minimized attrition and improve future study outcomes. The specific aims of this study are:

Aim #1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a MT+ intervention for achieving weight loss in rural overweight and obese men. The aim will specifically address groups by the 1) participation rates including number of men recruited and randomized over a 6 month period. 2) retention rates, 3) feasibility, usability, satisfaction ratings, 4) adherence record of logging by men in the intervention group, and 5) evaluative focus group feedback.

Aim #2: Determine preliminary efficacy of a MT+ intervention to a comparison group receiving only a basic self-monitoring app (MT) in achieving 1) weight loss (primary), and 2) improved dietary and PA behavior (secondary) at 6 months post-baseline in rural men.

Aim #3: Determine quantitative and qualitative indicators of community capacity (resource mobilization, learning opportunities-skills development, partnership linkages, participatory decision-making, leadership) to support a relevant weight loss intervention for rural men.

Through a collaborative process guided by Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) approaches with a community-academic partnership involving UNMC students, community leaders, the investigators plan to create and disseminate local knowledge about obesity in rural men. Specifically, the investigators plan to 1) document the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a weight loss intervention among rural men, a current gap in the NIH health disparities portfolio, 2) engage rural communities through student-informed outreach approaches and CAB partnership linkages to improve the efficacy of weight loss interventions for rural men, and 3) strengthen the research environment of the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) institution through providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to conduct CEnR.",COMPLETED,,2018-06-06,2022-06-30,2022-06-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,80,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Mobile Technology Plus"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""The intervention group MT+ will receive the premium-version mobile phone app with social comparison group, behavior change text messaging, and daily self-weighing via Wi-Fi scale."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Mobile Technology"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""The comparison group MT will receive the basic-version mobile phone app only to self monitor eating, activity, and weight."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BEHAVIORAL;BEHAVIORAL,mobile technology plus;mobile technology,1

OTHER_GOV,NCT03821779,Prefrontal Oscillations in Social Anxiety Disorder (POSAD),Study of Slow Prefrontal Cortex Oscillations During Social Exposure in Social Anxiety Disorder,Experimental fear in rodents is correlated with slow oscillations in electrical recordings of prefrontal cortex activities. The present study aims to test whether slow prefrontal oscillations is a biomarker of pathological anxiety in human subjects.,"Fear and anxiety are adaptive responses that may become excessive or inappropriate in pathological conditions, as defined as anxiety disorders in DSM-5. These disorders, including phobic disorders such as social anxiety disorder, are frequent and impairing in the general population, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 28% and significant consequences on quality of life. Direct and indirect medical costs related to these conditions amount to 74.4 billion €/year in Europe. Despite their prevalence, debilitating nature and chronicity, the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is poorly understood and neurobiological treatments, including pharmacotherapy, are lacking efficacy. A better understanding of the neuronal mechanisms implicated in anxiety is necessary for the conception of new approaches to treat pathological anxiety.

Anxiety is commonly modeled in animals using fear conditioning, which consists in associating a neutral stimulus (eg: a sound) with a mild electrical foot-shock. As a result of the association between sound and shock, sound presentation in isolation induces a set of conditioned behavioral responses, such as an immobilization (""freezing""). Previous studies have shown that the expression of fear responses, measured on the basis of freezing, is associated with the emergence of slow oscillations (2-6Hz) in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice. Moreover, emergence of these oscillations in mPFC is predictive of the occurrence of freezing, and the artificial induction of 4 Hz oscillations in mPFC with optogenetics induces freezing. Finally, inhibiting neurons in mPFC during the ascending phase of this slow mPFC oscillation at the time of conditioned sound presentation is sufficient to significantly reduce fear.

Interestingly, these results obtained in mice seem to find their prolongation in humans. Recent studies using fear conditioning in human subjects have also reported the emergence of prefrontal slow oscillations between 2-6 Hz during expression of conditioned fear responses. These results suggests that common mechanisms underlie the expression of fear in humans and rodents. However, whether similar neuronal circuits and mechanisms are implicated in human anxiety disorders remains unknown.

This study aims at assessing the presence of slow mPFC oscillations during expression of anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. Beyond understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying anxiety expression, this study could provide a biomarker of anxiety with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",RECRUITING,,2019-11-12,2026-05-09,2026-05-09,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,SEQUENTIAL,NONE,BASIC_SCIENCE,30,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""In vivo social exposure"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Subjects will be invited to give a 5 minutes oral presentation on the topic of their choice to five examiners displaying no facial emotional reaction, after a 5 minutes period of silent waiting in front of the examiners.

OTHER,NCT06982079,Effects of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors on Kidney Function in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease,Effects of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors on Kidney Function in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease,"The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether dapagliflozin can reduce the risk of worsening kidney function or death from cardiovascular or renal causes in adults with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), with or without type 2 diabetes. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Does dapagliflozin reduce the rate of decline in kidney function or progression to end-stage kidney disease in adults with advanced CKD?
2. Does dapagliflozin reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular or renal causes in patients with advanced CKD?

Researchers will compare dapagliflozin to a placebo to see if dapagliflozin improves kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in this high-risk population.","Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, originally developed as oral antihyperglycemic agents for managing type 2 diabetes, have quickly gained recognition for their broad therapeutic benefits beyond glycemic control. Since their clinical introduction in 2012, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated significant renoprotective and cardioprotective effects, reshaping treatment approaches in nephrology and cardiology.

Although these drugs have shown great promise, major clinical trials have typically excluded patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR \< 20 mL/min/1.73m²), those already on dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients-populations at the highest risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular complications, and mortality. This exclusion has left a critical gap in understanding the full potential of SGLT2 inhibitors in the most vulnerable patients. As such, current KDIGO guidelines have not recommended initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with eGFR \< 20 mL/min/1.73m².

CKD is a global health crisis, affecting approximately 10% of adults worldwide, with prevalence rising in Egypt, where 13% of adults are affected, especially in underserved rural areas. By 2040, CKD is projected to become the fifth leading cause of death worldwide.

For patients with kidney failure, the primary treatment options are renal replacement therapies like dialysis or transplantation. However, due to the scarcity of donor kidneys and the frequent presence of comorbidities in older populations, transplantation is often unfeasible. Consequently, most end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients rely on dialysis, a therapy that significantly lowers quality of life and increases mortality risk.

Preserving kidney function is a critical goal in CKD management, which is closely linked to better patient outcome. Incremental dialysis, a strategy aimed at preserving residual kidney function (RKF), shows promise but lacks robust clinical validation. Increasing evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors, even in patients with advanced CKD, may offer significant reno- and cardioprotective benefits, reinforcing the need for further research into their efficacy in this population.

For instance, in the DAPA-CKD trial, which included patients with an eGFR as low as 25 mL/min/1.73m², dapagliflozin demonstrated a consistent reduction in cardiovascular and renal outcomes, even in those with severely impaired kidney function. A subgroup analysis of the DAPA-CKD trial comparing 624 patients with an eGFR \<30 mL/min/1.73m2 to the remainder of the trial population with better kidney function, demonstrated that the efficacy of dapagliflozin in reducing cardiovascular and renal outcomes persisted in the population with impaired kidney function. Remarkably, patients who initiated dialysis during the trial continued to receive dapagliflozin or placebo, and those treated with dapagliflozin experienced a 21% reduction in relative risk for mortality. These findings challenge the traditional boundaries of SGLT2 inhibitor use, indicating potential benefits even in populations previously excluded from major trials.

Recent findings from the DAPA advKD trial (NCT05196347) further support this potential: in 180 patients with CKD stages 4-5 (eGFR 10-30 mL/min/1.73m²), dapagliflozin significantly slowed eGFR decline (-2.24 vs. -3.67 mL/min/1.73m²/yr in controls, p=0.019) and reduced composite renal outcomes (HR 0.50, p=0.019) over 1.6 years, despite a higher incidence of transient eGFR dips in the treatment group.

The 2023 UK Kidney Association Clinical Practice Guideline reinforces this paradigm shift, issuing a Grade 2B recommendation to consider SGLT2 inhibitor initiation in patients with eGFR \<20 mL/min/1.73m² to slow disease progression. This guidance is supported by indirect evidence from trials continuing SGLT2 inhibition until kidney replacement therapy initiation, as well as EMPA-KIDNEY data showing unattenuated renal benefits down to eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73m².

Emerging clinical data further supports the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in preserving RKF in patients undergoing dialysis. Recent case series have shown promising results, such as significant improvements in residual kidney urea clearance and reduced proteinuria among patients undergoing incremental hemodialysis while receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Similarly, in patients on peritoneal dialysis, SGLT2 inhibitors have been effective in preserving RKF. Pharmacokinetic data also suggest that dapagliflozin is well tolerated, minimally dialyzable, and exhibits non-accumulating pharmacokinetic properties in patients on dialysis.

Given the substantial benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with less severe CKD, coupled with preliminary evidence suggesting their potential in advanced CKD and dialysis populations, there is a pressing need to explore their long-term efficacy and safety in these high-risk groups. This research aims to fill that gap, with the potential to redefine CKD management and offer new hope to patients facing the highest risks of poor outcomes.",RECRUITING,,2025-05-01,2026-11-01,2026-06-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,60,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Dapagliflozin 10 mg"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Dapagliflozin 10 mg will be added in addition to standard of care"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,dapagliflozin 10 mg,0

OTHER,NCT01717079,rTMS and Body Shape Perception,Effect of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Disturbance of Body Shape Perception in Patients With Anorexia Nervosa,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a frequent, potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by a resistance to maintaining body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height, an intense fear of weight gain or being ""fat"" even though underweight, a loss of menstrual periods in girls and women post-puberty and a disturbance in the experience of body weight or shape. Body weight and shape dissatisfaction is linked to the development, maintenance and relapse of AN. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the inferior parietal cortex is involved in body image perception and less activated in patients with AN compared with healthy subjects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to modulate cortical excitability, and particularly to increase excitability with high-frequency rTMS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ""excitatory"" high-frequency rTMS over the ""hypoactive"" inferior parietal cortex of 54 patients with AN.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will compare effective rTMS (2000 ten-Hz stimulations per session, applied at 90% of the resting motor threshold, with 10 sessions in two weeks) versus placebo rTMS.

Assessments will be performed before rTMS and after the last rTMS session (immediately after, at 15 days and three months). The principal criteria for judgement is a body image satisfaction scale (Boby Shape Questionnaire, BSQ-34). The secondary criteria for judgement are eating behaviour scales (Eating Attitude Test, EAT-40; Bulimia test, BULIT and Eating Disorders Inventory, EDI-2), the Hamilton depression rating scale and Hamilton anxiety rating scale, a quality of life scale (Short-Form Health Survey, SF-36), a body composition analysis using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the alpha-MSH autoantibodies levels (biomarker for eating disorders recently described).

Inferior parietal cortex rTMS could not only improve body image perception, but also help in the treatment of eating disorders, allowing weight gain with a decreased anxiety and improving patients' quality of life. Also positive results could have direct therapeutic implications with the possibility to complete regular rTMS sessions, or to implant extradural electrodes for chronic parietal cortex stimulation.",,TERMINATED,Protocol stopped for safety reason,2013-05,2017-12-15,2017-12-15,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,QUADRUPLE,TREATMENT,22,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Sham rTMS"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""120 pulses 0.2Hz"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""rTMS"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""120 pulses 0.2Hz"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",PROCEDURE;PROCEDURE,sham rtms;rtms,0

Reuteri) on Oral Wound Healing (Pilot Study),This research will study the healing of standardized wounds created in the oral mucosa of volunteer participants during daily intake of tablets and topical application of oil containing the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri. Our null hypothesis is that the consumption and topical application of probiotic supplements containing L. reuteri does not improve clinical healing of oral wounds in healthy participants when compared to controls.,"Intervention: after informed consent and baseline collection of clinical data (age,sex), the participants will be randomly assigned to one of the order of the treatments. As a run-in period, they will be given a supply of probiotic or placebo tablets enough for seven days. The participants are instructed to take two tablets daily (one in the morning and one in the evening, days 0-7) and are asked to refrain from any other foods or supplements containing probiotics. On day eight, the participant will attend to the clinics and a punch biopsy will be performed. Depending on the allocation group, probiotic or placebo oil will be supplied. The participant will be instructed to apply the oil locally on the wound with a plastic microbrush for 9 days every evening, and strongly reinforced to continue with the assigned tablets twice daily. The participant will attend the clinics on days two, five and eight post-wounding for follow-up photographies of wound healing. The first intervention period terminates with a wash-out period of four weeks, and then the second run-in an intervention period start following the same procedures.

The probiotic tablets and the probiotic oil (at the recommended dose) contain 2x10\^8 CFU of Lactobacillus reuteri. Both the placebo tablets and oil are identical in size and composition but without the addition of the probiotic strains. The tablets and oil are packed in identical pots/bottles with color coding. The code will be kept from the investigators until the analysis are finished. Both the tablets and oil are provided by BIOGAIA AB.

Clinical procedures and sampling

All clinical procedures and sample collections will be conducted by a qualified and authorized dentist from the Institute of Odontology, Section for Cariology, Endodontics, Pediatric Dentistry and Clinical Genetics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. Collected samples (saliva, wound exudate and bacterial smear) will be stored in a freezer at -80 °C until all samples from all patients are gathered -for a maximum of six months. Running of all collected samples at the same time allows laboratory analyses to be carried out efficiently and avoids errors.

Punch biopsy: on day eight, a standardized circular wound of 3.5 mm diameter and approximately 1.5 mm deep will be created in the mucosa of the hard palate with aid of a biopsy punch. The biopsy is performed under aseptic conditions and local anesthesia using lidocaine 2% combined with epinephrine for local hemostasis. A scalpel is used to remove the surface epithelium and underlying superficial connective tissue, which will be discarded according to biosafety regulations from the Institute of Dentistry, University of Copenhagen. After wounding, the wound site will be photographed (blind-coded) with an intraoral camera, placing a standard-sized 6 mm diameter template around the wound as reference. The participant will attend to the dental clinics on days two, five and eight post-wounding to have a photograph of the wound taken by Ph.D student Gina Castiblanco. The wound-size on photographs will be measured by two raters and will be expressed as the ratio of the wound surface area relative to the standard label size with aid of software (Canvas 7, ACD Systems of America). The endpoint will be the percentage of initial wound size, measured at days two, five and eight post-wounding.

Saliva sampling: six samples of unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) fro m each subject will be collected (one at baseline, one right after the run-in period and one at the end of the intervention period). For USW collection, the participant will be sitting in a comfortable position with the head slightly bent. The participant is asked to keep the eyes open and make as few moves as possible, including swallowing. Then, he/she is asked to rinse the mouth in water and spit it out again. Thereafter, he/she is instructed to let saliva flow out of the mouth down a designated plastic cup for ten minutes. Aliquots of saliva (1.5 ml) will immediately be placed on ice and stored in a freezer at -80 °C until further analysis.

Collection of wound exudate: eight samples of wound exudate will be collected in total. The wound site will be dried with cotton pellets and periopaper strips (ProFlow, Amityville, NY, USA) will be gently pressed on the wound for 20 s. In case of blood contamination, the strip is discharged and the sampling is repeated after five min. The volume of exudate is recorded using a Peritron 8000 (Proflow) and expressed in µL. One strip holds approximately 0.1-0.4 µL of exudate. The strips are then transferred to plastic tubes and stored at -80 until further analysis.

Bacterial smear collection: four bacterial smears will be sampled. A sterile swab will be passed through the wound site, placed in a plastic tube and stored freezed at -80 °C until further analysis. The smears will be subjected to conventional microbial cultivation to detects the presence/absence and counts of bacterial species commonly associated with delayed wound healing (β-hemolytic streptococci and S. aureus).

Perception of pain and discomfort: a one-page logbook will be handed to the participants at the beginning of each run-in period so they can register the intake of tablets and their own perception of pain and discomfort according to a VAS-scale. The participant is also encouraged to register factors that could possibly influence the outcome (physical activity and number of alcoholic drinks). The participant will be asked to bring the filled logbook in the end of the intervention period.

Perceived stress and general health: in the end of the intervention period, the participant will be asked to fill the validated General Heath Questionnaire GHQ-12 (10) and the validated Perceived Stress Scale (11). These factors (self-perception of stress and general health) are known to be possible cofounders of wound healing outcomes.

Compliance: at the beginning of each intervention period, the participants will be provided with tablets enough for 16 days and oil for topical use enough for nine days application. Compliance will be checked through the participant´s completion of a logbook in which the daily intake of tablets and oil application is registered. For the last appointment, the participants will be asked to bring the remaining tablets and oil for counting/estimating.

Data analysis: all data will be processed with the open source statistics software ""R"" and controlled for normal distribution. Multivariate and univariate analysis of variance (MANOVAs and ANOVAs) will be used to assess within-subject change over time. A p-value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The obtained results will be published in an internationally recognized journal. If the results cannot be published in a journal, they will be available at the website of the University of the Odontology Institute. We make emphasis in that positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published.

Data management: all collected data will be treated in compliance with the Act on Processing of Personal Data and ""The Health Law"".

On this basis, we conducted the first international prospective phase II clinical trial of a selective lymph node dissection strategy to validate the clinical feasibility of a selective lymph node dissection strategy. The main objective of this study was to develop a selective lymph node dissection strategy for cT1NOM0 invasive NSCLC with a diameter of ≤2 cm, i.e., no lower mediastinal lymph node dissection for tumors located in the upper lobe, and no upper mediastinal lymph node dissection for tumors located in the lower lobe. Further, we retrospectively analyzed 7067 NSCLC cases with systematic lymph node dissection from April 2008 to July 2022, in which the rate of mediastinal lymph node metastasis was 15.4% (1091/7067), and there was no lymph node metastasis in 209 cases of AIS/MIA/LPA, whereas in other subtypes of adenocarcinomas, the rate of mediastinal lymph node metastasis was 15.3% (106 /695). Among them, we retrospectively analyzed 360 cases of cT1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer with 0.5 \< CTR \< 1.0 and found that among them, tumors located in the upper lobe had no lower mediastinal lymph node metastasis, and tumors located in the lower lobe had no metastasis in the upper mediastinal lymph nodes. For other non-small cell lung cancers with 0.5 \< CTR \< 1.0, if the VPI was negative, no lower mediastinal metastasis was also observed in tumors in the upper lobe and no upper mediastinal metastasis was observed in tumors in the lower lobe. In 212 cases of lung cancer not exceeding 1 cm in size, there were no lower mediastinal metastases in tumors in the upper lobe and no upper mediastinal metastases in tumors in the lower lobe.

The study investigated the efficacy and safety of a sex-selective lymph node strategy (no lower mediastinal lymph node clearance for upper lobe tumors and no upper mediastinal lymph node clearance for lower lobe tumors) in patients with 0.5 \< CTR \< 1 and ≤ 2 cm in diameter cT1N0M0 infiltrating NSCLC, aiming to more accurately assess the prognosis of the selective lymph node dissection strategy for nodes with 0.5 \< CTR \< 1 and ≤ 2 cm in diameter.",RECRUITING,,2024-05-01,2029-05-01,2026-05-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,684,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Selective lymph node dissection"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""For 0.5 \\< CTR \\< 1 and ≤ 2 cm diameter cT1N0M0 invasive non-small cell lung cancer patient sex for selective lymph node (lower mediastinal lymph nodes are not required to be cleared for upper lobe tumors and upper mediastinal lymph nodes are not required to be cleared for lower lobe tumors)"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",PROCEDURE,selective lymph node dissection,0

NIH,NCT00050479,Laser and Medical Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema,Preliminary Multi-Center Assessment of Laser and Medical Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema,"This study will compare the side effects of two laser treatments for diabetic macular edema, a common condition in patients with diabetes. In macular edema, blood vessels in the retina, a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye become leaky and the retina swells. The macula, the center part of the retina that is responsible for fine vision may also swell, causing vision loss. Traditional laser treatment (argon blue or green or yellow) for macular swelling, or edema, causes scarring that can expand and possibly lead to more loss of vision. Studies with a different type of laser (diode) may be less damaging. The results of this study on side effects of the treatments will be used to design a larger study of effectiveness. This study will also examine whether celecoxib (Celebrex® (Registered Trademark)), an anti-arthritis drug that reduces inflammation and swelling, can reduce inflammation and swelling of the retina. Patients with elevated cholesterol levels will be invited to participate in a cholesterol reduction part of the study to compare normal-pace cholesterol reduction with accelerated reduction.

Patients 18 years of age and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and macular edema that requires laser treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with the following tests and procedures:

* Medical history: to review past medical conditions and treatments.
* Physical examination: to measure vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature, breathing rate) and examine the head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, arms and legs.
* Eye examination: to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and examine pupils, lens, retina, and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops for this examination.
* Blood tests: to measure cholesterol, blood clotting time, hemoglobin A1C (a measure of diabetes control), and to evaluate liver and kidney function.
* Eye photography: to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur in the future. Special photographs of the inside of the eye are taken using a camera that flashes a bright light into the eye. From 2 to 20 pictures may be taken, depending on the eye condition.
* Fluorescein angiography: to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.

Participants will be randomly assigned to take celecoxib or placebo (an inactive, look-alike pill). Participants who have elevated cholesterol levels may return for a brief visit after 1 month. All patients will return for follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients who require laser treatment will be randomly assigned to one of the two laser treatments. For these procedures, eye drops are put in the eye to numb the surface and a contact lens is placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Several visits may be required for additional laser treatments. The maximum number of treatments depends on how well the treatment is working. Patients who respond well to the study medication may receive no laser treatments. After the first year, patients will be followed every 6 months until either the patient returns for a 3-year visit, the last enrolled patient returns for the 1-year visit, or the patient requests to leave the study. During the follow-up visits, patients' response to treatment will be evaluated with repeat tests of several of the screening exams.","This randomized pilot study is an important first step in planning a large multi-center clinical trial to evaluate medical and laser approaches that could improve the visual outcome for patients with diabetic retinopathy. This study will provide preliminary safety data on these therapies as well as allow for assessment of the performance of ocular outcomes and study design for use in subsequent trials. If there are no safety concerns, the results of this pilot will be helpful in the design of a large multicenter clinical trial by providing data on estimates of expected treatment effects.

Using a factorial design, this study will compare (1) diode (micropulse) laser photocoagulation to mild ETDRS style focal photocoagulation and, (2) treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib), or placebo prior to and following laser photocoagulation. The primary outcomes are a visual acuity drop or increase of 15 letters or more from baseline to year 3. The secondary outcome is a significant reduction in macular edema, defined as a 50% reduction in thickening as measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a two step reduction in macular thickness compared to standard stereoscopic fundus photographs, and a 50% reduction in the area of leakage as measured by fluorescein angiography. The University of Wisconsin Fundus Photography Reading Center will grade OCT, photographs, and angiograms and will be masked to treatment assignment. Other secondary outcomes will include the timing of the first required laser treatment, changes in visual acuity throughout the study, and the number of laser treatments required during the course of the study. In addition, all adverse events and abnormal laboratory values will be collected and tabulated. Specific objectives regarding safety and efficacy follow:

Safety

Is the risk of visual loss in patients with clinically significant diabetic macular edema potentially different across treatment groups?

Preliminary Assessment of Potential Outcomes

Is there evidence that any treatment combinations could be effective in reducing retinal thickening?

Is there evidence that celecoxib may inhibit or induce retinal thickening?

What are the estimated treatment effects on vision?

Is the number of laser treatments required to achieve a reduction in retinal thickening similar across treatment groups?

The tertiary objective of this study will be to examine the effects of dramatically reducing low-density lipoproteins cholesterol in patients with diabetic macular edema and elevated serum lipid levels. Change vision and retinal thickness will be compared across three groups; (1) patients without elevated serum lipids at baseline, (2) patients with elevated lipid levels at baseline and receive standard of care treatment, and (3) patients with elevated lipid levels at baseline and are aggressively treated pharmacologically.",COMPLETED,,2002-12,2006-07,,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,,,,TREATMENT,100,,"[{""name"": ""Celecoxib (Celebrex)"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,celecoxib (celebrex),1

   * To evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term orally administration of CN128 in thalassaemia patients with blood transfusion dependent and aged 16 and above.
2. Design:

   * The study is designed as a single arm and opened phase IIa clinical trial, so as to investigate the safety and efficacy of CN128.
   * A total of 50 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled, and orally administration of CN128 for 24 weeks or 48 weeks according to the administration plan. The treatment period is from day 0 to 24 weeks, and the extended treatment period was from 25 weeks to 96 weeks.
   * Administration plan:

   (1)0 day\~48 weeks： The trial will start with the lower dose of CN128 (10 mg/kg body weight \[bw\], bid) for two weeks, then the subjects will return to the study center. If no unacceptable toxicity associated with CN128 is found, the subjects will be given the higher dose (15 mg/kg body weight \[bw\], bid). If unacceptable toxicity associated with CN128 is found, the subjects will be suspended or stopped administration. If the adverse event turns to normal or abnormal but no clinical significance after suspension administration, the subjects will be given the lower dose of CN128 (10 mg/kg body weight \[bw\], bid).

   After taking CN128 at 15 mg/kg, if unacceptable toxicity associated with CN128 is found, the dosage will be reduce to 10 mg/kg. If no symptoms appear, the dose can be increased to 15 mg/kg. If the unacceptable toxicity related to CN128 still occurs, the subjects will be suspended or stopped administration. If the adverse event turns to normal or abnormal but no clinical significance after suspension administration, the subjects will be given the lower dose of CN128 (10 mg/kg body weight \[bw\], bid). The dose will be assessed once every two or four weeks.

   Subjects' medication status, uncomfortable symptoms, concomitant medication or non-drug therapy were recorded daily.

   (2)49 weeks\~96 weeks： Subjects who have completed 48 weeks of treatment may continue dosing at the original dose until the end of the study or withdraw early if they do not experience intolerable toxicity associated with CN128 tablets and have fair efficacy (≥20% elevation on MRI T2\*) and if, in the judgment of the investigator, the benefits outweigh the risks.

   Subjects who have completed 48 weeks of treatment, who have not experienced intolerable toxicity associated with CN128 tablets, but who have been assessed by the investigator as having poor efficacy (\<20% elevation of MRI T2\*) and in the judgment of the investigator the benefit outweighs the risk, may, with the subject's consent, have the dosage increased at the additional visit or the established most recent visit to 15 mg/kg in the morning and 20 mg/kg in the evening, with an assessment made at 2 weeks of dosing：

   If no relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the dose may continue to be increased to 20 mg/kg bid and assessed after 2 weeks of dosing:
   1. If no relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the 20 mg/kg bid dose may be administered until the end of the study or early withdrawal (daily dose 40 mg/kg/d);
   2. If relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the dose may be reduced to 15 mg/kg in the morning and 20 mg/kg bid in the evening until the end of the study or early withdrawal (daily dose 35 mg/kg/d).

   If relevant intolerable toxicity occurs, the dose may be reduced to 15 mg/kg bid until the end of the study or early withdrawal (daily dose 30 mg/kg/d).

For patients taking multiple medications, hospitalization often involves numerous changes to their treatment regimen. For community pharmacies, discharge prescriptions are often complex, and they sometimes lack the information that pharmacists need to deliver the treatment as safely as possible. As a result, there is a risk of medication errors, and a risk for patients. We aim to evaluate the benefits of this collaboration for adult patients admitted to the internal medicine ward of a regional hospital who are taking seven or more drugs and are being discharged to home.

The main question it aims to answer is : Does the enhanced collaboration reduce the number of drug-related problems encountered by community pharmacists with discharge prescriptions ? Researchers will compare patients when a hospital pharmacist is involved during the discharge process and when he or she is not involved, which corresponds to normal care.

The hospital pharmacist will not perform the intervention directly on the patient, but only with the community pharmacy.

The study population is 36 Latinas who have recently completed treatment for solid tumor cancers and their informal caregiver (36 dyads). Research suggests that family members can be facilitators to behavior change more specifically, Latinos rely on family support more than non-Hispanic Whites.

Fewer than 20% of Latina cancer survivors meet the American Cancer Society's (ACS) Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity.

1. whether an imaging test called a PET (Positron emission tomography) scan performed after two cycles of standard chemotherapy is able to identify patients who have a high cure rate after completing standard chemotherapy alone; and
2. whether high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) when used in combination with an antibody called Rituximab results in high cure rates for those patients predicted to do poorly with standard chemotherapy by the PET scan.","BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:

Although the addition of Rituximab anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy to standard CHOP chemotherapy (R-CHOP) results in a 15-20% increase in absolute EFS rate over CHOP alone for DLBCL patients, it is likely that 40-50% of patients with poor prognosis DLBCL will not be cured by R-CHOP. High dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been shown to salvage a substantial proportion of patients with relapsed DLBCL. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing standard-dose chemotherapy (SDCT) alone to SDCT followed by HDCT/ASCT as initial treatment for poor prognosis DLBCL demonstrated a significant benefit for HDCT over SDCT in terms of EFS and OS. A single centre prospective phase II study was conducted in Calgary to assess feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of two cycles of HDCT following just one cycle of CHOP induction therapy for patients under 65 years of age who were diagnosed with aggressive histology lymphoma and 2-3 Age Adjusted International Prognostic Index (AAIPI) risk factors. The study was conducted prior to the widespread use of Rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP). The treatment protocol involved one cycle of standard dose CHOP followed by one cycle of dose-intensive cyclophosphamide 5.25 g/m2, etoposide 1.05 g/m2, cisplatin 105 mg/m2 (DICEP), then autologous blood stem cell collection, followed by one cycle of high dose BCNU 300 mg/m2, etoposide 800 mg/m2, Ara-C 1600 mg/m2, melphalan 140 mg/m2 (BEAM) and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and radiotherapy to prior bulk. With a median follow up of 49 months, 4 year event free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for the 55 patients accrued to the study were 72% (95% CI=60-84%) and 79% (95% CI=69-90%), respectively.

The two major advances in lymphoma management that have occurred since the design of our CHOP-DICEP-BEAM/ASCT phase II study are the addition of Rituximab anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy to chemotherapy (as described above), and the use of FDG-PET functional imaging/response assessment. Several studies have reported the strong correlation of early response assessment using FDG-PET with PFS and OS following standard chemotherapy for aggressive NHL. In one of the largest, best designed studies, PET-negativity following 2 cycles of RCHOP was associated with higher 2-year estimates of EFS (82% vs 43% , p \< .001) and OS (90% vs 61%, p = .006). The incorporation of Rituximab and PET-guided HDCT/ASCT into our intensive chemotherapy protocol may lead to further improvements in EFS while decreasing the overall need for HDCT/ASCT by targeting those patients destined to fail R-CHOP by early PET-based response assessment.

STUDY OBJECTIVES:

1. To determine if negative FDG-PET imaging following 2 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy is able to identify a group of patients with excellent prognosis (80% 3-year EFS) following standard 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy alone.
2. To determine if a group of patients with positive FDG-PET imaging following 2 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy are able to achieve excellent outcome (80% 3-year EFS) following intensive chemotherapy with R-DICEP and R-BEAM/ASCT.
3. To determine if PET-guided R-DICEP and R-BEAM/ASCT is feasible and associated with acceptable toxicity rates in a multi-centre study.

The anatomical regions of the intervertebral disc include the central nucleus pulposus, the peripheral fibrocartilaginous annulus fibrosus, and the superior and inferior cartilaginous endplates (CEP). The CEP is a thin layer of hyaline cartilage located between the avascular intervertebral disc and the bony vertebral endplate. The endplate cartilage consists of chondrocytes interspersed throughout an extracellular matrix of proteoglycans, collagen (types I and II), and water. It plays an important role in the function and homeostasis. The CEP has been considered the pathway between the largely avascular disk tissues and the blood supply of the vertebral body and thus provides nutrition for disk cells. Many musculoskeletal tissues, including the CEP, cartilage-bone interface of articular joints, entheses, tendons, and ligaments, have components with very short T2 values (much less than 1 msec), which are orders of magnitude shorter than that of the nucleus of the disk (\~100 msec). In a conventional pulse sequence, such as proton density-weighted spin-echo (SE) or fast SE, with standard clinical section profile, the minimum echo time (TE) is typically 10 msec, which is much longer than that needed to capture the short-lived signal from these tissues. Recently, ultrashort echo sequence UTE technology has been introduced, and the TE time can be as low as 0.008ms. This range of TE is sufficient to capture signals from the cartilage endplate before it decays.

This has been shown to be a successful strategy to increase physical activity and improve academic performance. The existing designs have confounded academic lessons with physical activity. As a result, it is impossible to determine if the subsequent improvement in academic performance is due to: (1) physical activity, (2) the academic content of the active learning, or (3) the combination of academic material taught through physical activity.

Methods / Design: The Texas I-CAN project is a 3-arm, cluster randomized control trial in which 28 elementary schools were assigned to either control, math intervention, or spelling intervention. As a result, each intervention condition serves as an unrelated content control for the other arm of the trial, allowing the impact of physical activity to be separated from the content. That is, schools that perform only active math lessons provide a content control for the spelling schools on spelling outcomes. This also calculated direct observations of attention and behavior control following periods of active learning.

Discussion: This design is unique in its ability to separate the impact of physical activity, in general, from the combination of physical activity and specific academic content.

During the preliminary stages we had to undertake a pilot trial to get information on safety and feasibility of combined chemotherapy with simultaneous treatment of the LMWH Enoxaparin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who are at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to local cancer spread.","The trial was a prospective, open-label, single center investigation in patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer who were treated with first-line chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. The intensified treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1g/m² (30 min), 5-flourouracil 750 mg/m² (24 h), folinic acid 200 mg/m² (30 min), and Cisplatin 30 mg/m² (90 min) on day 1 and 8; q3w). Beyond initial 3 months of intensified chemotherapy all patients without cancer progression received further treatment with gemcitabine alone to prevent patients from cumulative toxicities. The concomitant use of Enoxaparin started on day 1 of chemotherapy with a fixed dose of 40 mg daily until cancer progression. Dose adjustment for enoxaparin was recommended in patients with impaired kidney function or thrombocytopenia within the study according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria guidelines to minimize bleeding risk.

The investigators will examine the equivalence of treatment outcomes among patients receiving injectable treatment within the MORE program as compared to those of patients receiving Cabenuva in standard care at Whitman-Walker Health.","Advances in HIV treatment could promote better health and racial equity to address the gaps seen across the HIV care continuum nationally and locally. In Washington DC, HIV viral load suppression among People Living With HIV (PLWH) lies at 66%. Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc., d/b/a Whitman-Walker Health (WWH), is a Federally Qualified Health Center (""FQHC"") affiliated with Whitman-Walker Institute, Inc. (""Institute""). Institute is uniquely capable of addressing gaps with Cabenuva through WWH's existing MORE program, which includes supportive navigation and wrap-around services paired with home-based HIV care. However, there are many implementation knowledge gaps to identify with implementing Cabenuva injection protocols for PLWH who face significant barriers to retention in care and who may significantly benefit from integrating Cabenuva within the context of the MORE program.

The investigators propose a home-delivered Cabenuva HIV care program in Washington, D.C. to address the local HIV care continuum gaps. The investigative team has over five years of experience and lessons learned from our Mobile Outreach, Retention and Engagement (MORE) home-based HIV care program and plan to integrate Cabenuva therapy. MORE utilizes NP/PA providers and an HIV care navigator to deliver care to over 130 HIV-infected clients, who have a history of having fallen out of care, in their homes. The investigators envision that the inclusion of injectable treatment can expand the current program by geographic reach and the number of PWLH served by coupling Cabenuva with our ability to deliver patient-centered care outside of the traditional clinic. This proposal is critical to gathering early insights in Cabenuva implementation in Washington, D.C. and other EHE territories in FQHC clinic and affiliated non-clinic settings. Moreover, the data collected will demonstrate the extent to which a population experiencing significant barriers to retention in care-for whom Cabenuva would otherwise likely be counterindicated-can be supported via the MORE program to achieve comparable adherence and outcomes to typical patients receiving standard of care Cabenuva.

WWH is currently providing Cabenuva treatment as a treatment option for eligible patients. The purpose of the proposed study is to further investigate the delivery of Cabenuva among two subpopulations of WWH patients.

Cabenuva within standard clinical care at WWH: The majority of WWH patients receiving HIV treatment are offered and receive Cabenuva within the standard clinical setting. Among these patients, the proposed study will gather EMR-based data to characterize retention and HIV outcomes and to compare these and other relevant implementation factors with the MORE group. Medical providers identify eligible patients for Cabenvua based on a WWH protocol devised by medical leadership and a Cabenuva workgroup. Eligibility is viral load \< 100,000 copies, no medication contraindications, no co-existing Hepatitis B infection, and no RAMs for rilpivirine or cabotegravir. Medical providers explain the risk and benefits and if the patient desires Cabeuva, the prescription is sent to the WWH onsite pharmacy at WWH sites MRC or 1525. The patient's case is sent via the EHR to the Cabenuva injection clinic admin lead at WWH. Patient appointment reminders and medication attainment are coordinated through SMS and phone call communication with patients.

Cabenuva within MORE-based clinical care at WWH: To address the unique structural and psychosocial factors that create significant barriers to engagement and retention in care for a subset of patients with a history of non-retention, the MORE program was developed. MORE's primary features include home-based care delivery, dedicated care navigation, transportation support, and wrap-around supportive services. WWH is currently expanding the MORE program to provide injectable Cabenuva to these patients for whom, without the intensive support of the MORE program, treatment with Cabenuva would likely be counterindicated.

Compliance with the disease and immunosuppressive treatment has an important place in the success of transplants. This study was planned to examine the effect of video-supported education given to liver transplant patients in line with the Health Belief Model on adaptation to chronic disease and medication use.

The research will be conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study. The population of the research will consist of adult patients who received liver transplantation at İnönü University Turgut Özal Medical Center. The sample will consist of 90 patients determined by power analysis. Patients will be divided into three groups: control (n=30), 1st experiment (n=30) and 2nd experiment (n=30). Data will be collected between August 2023 and December 2023 using the Patient Information Form, Chronic Disease Adaptation Scale, Immunosuppressive Drug Use Compliance Scale and Rational Drug Use Scale. Video-supported training will be provided to patients in the experimental group to increase compliance with the disease and immunosuppressive treatment and to ensure rational drug use. Patients in the 1st experimental group will receive video-supported training in line with the Health Belief Model for one month, and patients in the 2nd experimental group will receive video-supported standard training for one month. This video training will be given to the experimental group patients outside the routine nursing care of the clinic. The video-supported training is planned to last 20-30 minutes. Nursing care in the routine practice of the clinic will be applied to the control group. Evaluation of data; It will be done with number, percentage, mean, standard deviation, chi-square, paired t test, t test analysis in independent groups, ANOVA and ANCOVA.

As a result, it is predicted that video-supported education will increase compliance with chronic disease and medication use and reduce post-transplant symptoms and discomfort caused by these symptoms.","Although there are studies on video-supported education in the literature, no research has been found examining the effect of video-assisted education in line with SIM on disease adaptation and medication use in liver transplant patients. For this reason, in this research, it is aimed to minimize the risks by obtaining information about the beliefs and tendencies of the patients, adapting to chronic diseases and medication use, with the video-supported training prepared in line with the use of SIM as an effective tool. The research is unique because it is the first study comparing the education provided with SIM and standard education.

Computed tomography pulmonary angriography (CTPA) and lung ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy (VQ) are considered the gold-standards in PE-diagnostics but may not always be feasible. CTPA is contraindicated by contrast allergy or renal failure and both modalities require involvement of multiple staff-members and transport of the patient. Lung scintigraphy cannot be performed in an emergency situation, with unstable patients and patients unable to comply to the examination.

Ultrasound represent a possible tool in confirming or dismissing clinical PE suspicion. Ultrasound is non-invasive and can be performed bedside by the clinician, an approach known as point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS), reducing both time, radiation-exposure and costs.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether integrating cardiac, lung and deep venous ultrasound in the clinical evaluation of suspected PE reduces the need for referral to CTPA or lung scintigraphy, during emergency department work up, while maintaining safety standards.","All ultrasound examinations will be performed by a physician certified in ultrasound by the Danish Society for Emergency Physicians in accordance with the Danish Health Agency.

Based on ultrasonographic findings, PE suspicion is allocated to one of three categories:

1. Clinical suspicion of PE confirmed if ≥1 of the following ultrasound findings:

1. Visible proximal deep venous thrombus
2. ≥2 hypoechoic subpleural lung consolidations with a diameter of ≥0,5cm
3. Visible right ventricular thrombus
4. McConnell's sign if no known pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, COPD or pulmonary valve disease
5. D-sign present in both systole and diastole if no known pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, COPD or pulmonary valve disease

If PE is confirmed by ultrasound, the physician will apply the simplified pulmonary embolism severity index score (sPESI) and estimate risk of mortality within 30 days based on clinical signs and symptoms, cardiac troponin level and RV dysfunction. Patients with intermediate-high or high risk, requiring admission to a cardiology department will be referred for CTPA. Patients with low or intermediate-low risk, not requiring admission, will be discharged with anticoagulative treatment.

A thorough presentation of the sPESI-score and early mortality risk assessment is available in the 2019 collaborative guidelines by the ERS and ESC on the diagnosis and management of PE.

2. Further diagnostic imaging (CTPA or V/Q) required if ≥1 of the following ultrasound findings:

1. 1 hypoechoic subpleural lung consolidation with a diameter of ≥0,5cm
2. Pleural effusion not explained by other cause
3. Basal RVEDD/LVEDD \>1.0 or an RV visibly larger than the LV
4. TAPSE \<17 mm
5. No deep venous thrombus, no lung consolidation or effusion, no signs of RV strain or thrombus but strong clinical suspicion.
6. McConnell's or D-sign in the presence of known pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, COPD or pulmonary valve disease

If PE suspicion can be neither dismissed nor confirmed after ultrasound investigation, the patient will be referred to further investigation as usual with CTPA or lung scintigraphy. Subsequent plan will be in accordance with department guidelines.

3. Clinical suspicion of PE dismissed if ≥1 of the following ultrasound findings:

1. No deep venous thrombus, no lung consolidation or effusion, no signs of RV strain or thrombus and a plausible differential diagnosis or low clinical suspicion
2. Obvious differential diagnosis demonstrated on ultrasound (i.e., pneumonia, pneumothorax, interstitial syndrome, left sided heart failure)

The study will determine if giving information during treatment may help patients cope better with their treatment. The hypothesis is that participants assigned to receive Technology-Enhanced Nurse-directed Navigation will be more likely to adhere to treatment regimens and have improved symptom management than women who have access to the education portal only.,"Treatment for breast cancer has been proven to decrease death from breast cancer. The key to the success of treatment is getting the right dose at the right time, but many women do not receive optimum treatment. Treatment delays, missed appointments, and failure to take medication on a regular basis lead to poorer survival from breast cancer. In a study among low income women only 60% of women adhered to the treatment, that is, taking their medication at least 80% of the time. Twenty percent of women, who were supposed to take 5 years of hormone treatment, had stopped their medication in the first year. Similar problems occur with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Its main questions are whether the Trak platform combined with conventional therapy helps patients achieve optimal functionality with fewer in-person sessions compared to conventional rehabilitation alone and whether the Trak platform improves adherence to treatment, independence in daily activities, and quality of life while reducing resource consumption.

Researchers will compare the use of the Trak platform combined with conventional rehabilitation to standard rehabilitation practices to determine its impact on functional outcomes, patient and provider satisfaction, and resource efficiency.

Participants will:

* Use the Trak Platform as part of their personalized treatment plan.
* Attend face-to-face rehabilitation sessions as prescribed.
* Participate in assessments to measure functionality, adherence, independence, quality of life, and resource utilization.","This randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial conducted at Cruces University Hospital focuses on enhancing recovery outcomes by integrating telerehabilitation into conventional therapy.

The trial involves two parallel groups: an experimental group (EG) using the TRAK platform and conventional face-to-face rehabilitation and a control group (CG) undergoing the last methodology (conventional rehabilitation) alone. Participants in the EG will perform four weekly 30-minute at-home sessions on the TRAK platform, which utilizes artificial intelligence for real-time movement guidance, posture correction, and gamified motivation. Conventional therapy in both groups includes bi-weekly sessions of cryotherapy, joint mobilization, strength exercises, and gait re-education. This hybrid approach aims to personalize care, optimize functionality, and reduce the required face-to-face sessions.

Primary outcomes focus on reducing on-site rehabilitation sessions needed for functional recovery, while secondary outcomes assess adherence, independence, quality of life, and patient satisfaction.

It remains unanswered whether natural infection produces sustained antibodies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the presence of IgG antibodies for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after 5 months in inhabitants of Barrio 31 who consented the Seroprevalence Study for COVID-19.","Background Between June 10t h and July 1st, a cross-sectional design study was carried out in an Argentina slum over people, selected from a probabilistic sample of households showed a prevalence based on IgG-class antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 of 53.4%. In regarding to the persistence of these antibodies, the early data brought hope that acquired immunity was possible. But some subsequent studies have suggested that immune protection might be short-lived. The new findings show that people who survive a COVID-19 infection continue to produce protective antibodies against key parts of the virus for at least three to four months after developing their first symptoms. In contrast, some other antibody types decline more quickly.

It remains unanswered whether natural infection produces a sustained immunity that is capable of establishing herd immunity. The other health problem that Latin America faces is dengue, whose transmission, like SARS-CoV-2, is greater in areas with high population density such as vulnerable neighborhoods. In this context, the occurrence of the two diseases implies a risk, particularly in regions with several dengue serotypes where secondary and tertiary infections have been demonstrated and dengue epidemiological surveillance has been affected by the saturation of health system.

Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate the presence of IgG antibodies for COVID-19 after 5 months in inhabitants of this slum who consented the Seroprevalence Study for COVID-19, and to evaluate those factors associated with the persistence of positive antibodies. As a secondary objective, the presence of positive IgG for dengue will be evaluated.

Methods Cross sectional study. Population of the study were inhabitants of the slum: men and women form 14 years of age or older were included. People will be invited to participated and detection of antibodies will be performed with ta serological tests, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed and validated in Argentina which detects antibodies against two viral antigens, trimeric spike and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Blood sample will be collected in a capillary tube from a finger prick taken at the doorstep of each person. Samples will be processed and analyzed at the ""Hospital de Niños Doctor Ricardo Gutierrez"" Virology laboratory.

Blood sample collection and epidemiological data were collected, and entered in a secure database.

Sample Size The first seroprevalence study included 426 inhabitants of 14 years or more. Considering a persistence of antibodies of 30% with a precision of 5% for a confidence interval of 95% 184 inhabitants should be included. This sample will be selected by a proportionate stratified random sampling, considering the ten sectors in which the slum is divided.

Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics of the data will be carried out according to the variables obtained. Continuous variables will be expressed as mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables as proportions. A multiple logistic regression model will be performed to evaluate the factors associated with the persistence of positive antibodies for SARS-CoV-2.

OTHER,NCT04721379,Effect of Heartfulness Meditation on Brain Waves and How Calm One Feels During Meditation,Impact of Heartfulness Meditation on EEG (Brain Waves) and Meditation Depth,"Objectives:

1. To assess the EEG patterns and EKG recordings of participants with no meditation experience with simply closing the eyes for 10 minutes followed by relaxing for 30 minutes.
2. To assess the EEG patterns and EKG recordings of participants with no meditation experience by simply closing the eyes for 10 minutes and then with guided Heartfulness relaxation and meditation for 30 minutes.
3. To assess the baseline anxiety score through GAD-7 questionnaire, subjective experience of all the participants through MEDEQ questionnaire that measures the depth of the meditation experience after the session and correlate with the EEG patterns of the brain and heart rate changes.

EEG and EKG data from the groups will be analyzed by the sleep specialist. EKG device data for HRV and the EEG data will be correlated with the subjective depth of meditation experience in both the groups","Neurological correlates of states of mind during meditation have been studied with Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional MRIs for many decades. Meditation practices produce distinct EEG brain waveforms, and this may be reflective of the overall subjective experiences. Long term meditators using mindfulness have shown gamma activation on EEG recordings. Practice of Yoganidra and Sahaja meditation have been reported to show increased theta activity. Transcendental Meditation practices have shown alpha waves during meditative periods. While most of the meditative practices may appear similar, there may be subtle differences that might make them better suited for particular conditions. However, most of the studies conducted were small, non-randomized and therefore the outcomes are unclear.

The investigators wish to conduct a randomized controlled prospective study using Heartfulness meditation techniques. Heartfulness meditation practice is a simple heart-based meditation practice that has been shown to improve burnout, emotional wellness and sleep. In a younger subset of patients, it has also shown to increase the telomere length. However, the neurological and physiological correlates of this practice have not been assessed. This study will investigate whether using this novel approach of a heart-based meditation program leads to measurable changes in the EEG and also whether there is any correlation with the waveforms and the depth of meditation. This may provide an explanation from a neurological basis for the improvement of certain wellness parameters such as sleep. In addition, meditation practices have been shown to have positive benefits on cardiovascular system including heart rate variability (HRV). Cardiovascular physiology measured by continuous electrocardiogram (EKG) monitoring is a non-invasive way of measuring HRV. In this study, a correlation of the EEG and HRV with the subjective depth of meditation experience measured through meditation depth questionnaire (MEDEQ) along with baseline anxiety score as measured by generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) will be assessed.

Primary outcome and Hypotheses:

1. The primary outcome will be observing a change in EEG pattern of subjects who follow a Heartfulness guided meditation as compared to unguided self-relaxation and meditation.
2. The study team hypothesize that guided Heartfulness meditation will be associated with deeper relaxed brain wave patterns - predominantly theta and delta waves - compared to beta and alpha waves in unguided self-relaxation and meditation. The investigators anticipate that subjects will perceive an increased depth of meditation during a guided relaxation session compared to simply closing the eyes for the duration of the study. Since participants have no prior meditation experience, the investigators hypothesize that the first attempt at meditation is adequate to induce a relaxed state and EEG changes.
3. With regards to EKG changes, the study team hypothesize that there will be a reduction in heart rate and increased beat-to-beat variability with guided meditation as compared to unguided self-relaxation for the same duration.",UNKNOWN,,2021-07-31,2023-02-15,2022-08-15,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,OTHER,80,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Meditation"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""1.

Specifically, when breaking sedentary time which physical activity pattern- and intensity modifies the negative effects of sedentary behavior on glucose- and lipid metabolism? This lack of quantitative evidence calls for prospective experimental studies investigating the physiological and biological impacts of sedentary behavior, as well as the effectiveness of different strategies to reduce sedentary time. Thus, quantifying effects of the intensity, frequency, volume of sedentary breaks and/or physical activity on predefined outcomes is of importance.

Aims:

Our primary aims are to investigate the effects of breaking up sedentary time on glucose- and lipid metabolism and thus examine whether physical activity intensity breaks during sedentary breaks matter. Specifically, the aims of the PhD-project are to provide knowledge on the following questions:

• How does high- or low physical activity intensity sedentary breaks acutely influence glucose- and lipid metabolism under iso-caloric conditions?","The participants will undergo 3 different trial conditions of which all are iso-caloric, but with different intensities when executing physical activity (PA) by treadmill walking corresponding to 25-30% or 80-85%, respectively, of their individual VO2max/peak values. PA intensities are estimated from the individual's pre-test. The trial-conditions are iso-caloric, and tailored to each individual's energy expenditure. This study has a is randomized cross-over design. If found eligible from step 1 and 2 in the inclusion process, participants will be invited to a final screening day in our lab. Eligible participants then consenting to joining the study will continue on to 3 trial days. Due to possible acute rise in insulin for up to 48 hours, a 5-14 day washout period between trials will be used to avoid carryover effects. In the washout periods between experimental conditions the participants will resume their habitual life activities and behaviors, i.e., diet and physical activity patterns. However, from visit 2, during washout the participants will wear accelerometers (ActiGraph GTX3+, Pensacola, FL) during waking hours to objectively measure sedentary time and physical activity for 7 consecutive days after each trial. Average sedentary time (hour/day) and time spent in , light-, moderate- and vigorous physical activity intensity (min/day) will be derived. During the main trial days, the participants may read or work on a personal computer during the sedentary time in the respective trial conditions. The sample size calculations with glucose as the primary outcome, are based on the study by Dunstan et al. (2012).

This research focuses on the urinary microbiome and for a decade it has been known that urine is not sterile. Expanded Quantitative Urine Culture (EQUC) techniques have allowed for more comprehensive and accurate 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing of the urinary microbiome. Changes in the abundance and diversity of the resident microbiota have been associated with a number of urogenital conditions including interstitial cystitis, urinary incontinence, responses to OAB medications and symptoms of urinary tract infections. These studies provide insight to the fact that the microbiome plays an important role in the maintenance of a healthy urogenital tract. Thus, treatments that target the microbiome for one condition may work for others by similar mechanisms, especially when there is considerable symptom overlap between the two conditions as there is in UTIs and OAB.

One such treatment is cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) extract, which has long been used as complementary therapy for a variety of medical conditions. Health benefits are linked to the presence of phytochemicals present in the fruit- anthocyanins, flavonols, tannins, proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acid derivatives. Cranberry is known to be effective in the prevention of UTIs. In a recent study examining its use in women with dry OAB, daily dried cranberry improved urgency symptoms and number of daytime voids. In addition, the authors reported an improvement in the validated subjective instrument, Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC). Moderately symptomatic LUTS in men improved following 6 months of daily dried cranberry powder. Therefore, the investigators aim to investigate changes to the female urinary microbiome in women with dry OAB who take daily dried cranberry extract. This study aims to quantify a change in urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and PPBC following the daily use of a cranberry extract called NDS-446. The investigators also have an ancillary hypothesis that women who are post-menopausal will develop a urinary microbiome more similar to pre-menopausal women by the end of the study.

It will compare Implementation as Usual of MISSION to Facilitation Implementation of MISSION.,"Background: Homeless Veterans often have multiple health care and psychosocial needs, including assistance with access to housing and health care, as well as support for ongoing treatment engagement. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) developed specialized Homeless Patient Alignment Care Teams (HPACT) with the goal of offering an integrated, ""one-stop program"" to address the Housing and Healthcare needs of Homeless Veterans. However, while 70% of HPACT's Veteran enrollees have co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD), HPACT does not have a uniform, embedded treatment protocol for this subpopulation. One wraparound intervention designed to address the needs of homeless Veterans with COD which is suitable to be integrated into HPACT clinic sites is the evidence-based practice called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition, or MISSION-Vet. Despite the promise of MISSION-Vet within HPACT clinics, implementation of an evidence based intervention within a busy program like HPACT can be difficult. The current study is being undertaken to identify an appropriate implementation strategy for MISSION-Vet within HPACT. The study will test the implementation platform called Facilitation and compared to implementation as usual (IU).

Aims: (1) Compare the extent to which IU or Facilitation strategies achieve fidelity to the MISSION-Vet intervention as delivered by HPACT homeless provider staff. (2) Compare the effects of Facilitation and IU strategies on the National HPACT Performance Measures. (3) Compare the effects of IU and Facilitation on the permanent housing status. (4) Identify and describe key stakeholders' (patients, providers, staff) experiences with, and perspectives on, the barriers to, and facilitators of implementing MISSION.

Design: Type III Hybrid modified stepped wedge implementation comparing IU to Facilitation across 7 HPACT teams in 3 sites in the greater Los Angeles VA system.

Discussion: Integrating MISSION-Vet within HPACT has the potential to improve the health of thousands of Veterans but, it is crucial to implement the intervention appropriately in order for it to succeed.

This device has been developed by IIT - Italian Institute of Technology and it consists of a two-degree-of-freedom electromechanical platform which is able to perform most of the exercises foreseen by the standard rehabilitation programs. By virtue of its innovative motion system and control architecture, ARBOT integrates multiple rehabilitation equipment functions, performing also special exercise programs such as elastic and fluid-dynamic resistance.

ARBOT allows training according to programmed sequences, in order to promote range of movement, muscular function and proprioceptive recovery. Exercises can be performed with or without bearing weight. Moreover, ARBOT is a powerful evaluation instrument for physiotherapists in order to verify and record the results of rehabilitative intervention.

The primary aim of this trial was to determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of robot-assisted rehabilitation using ARBOT in patients with ankle dysfunction resulting from work related ankle fractures, compared with conventional rehabilitation programs. Secondary objectives was to investigate correlations among physical and disability parameters, to collect data in order to define further study protocols and improve ARBOT's performance and ergonomics, and ultimately to evaluate patient satisfaction with respect to robot assisted rehabilitation programs.

METHODS:

Thirty-two patients with work related injuries resulting in ankle and/or hindfoot fractures and subsequent to the immobilization phase was enrolled in an open randomized controlled trial over a 30 month period. Each participant was randomly allocated to experimental or control group and received a 4-week rehabilitation program (20 sessions, for 5 days/week from admission to discharge in the Rehabilitation Centre) and weekly robotic and clinical assessments.

Subjects in the experimental group were treated using ARBOT with passive, active and active assisted range-of-motion exercises, resistive exercises in isometric, isotonic, isokinetic, elastic and fluid-dynamic conditions, and proprioceptive training. Control subjects were assisted by a physiotherapist during range of motion recovery exercises and performed resistive and proprioceptive training using Biodex System 3 dynamometer and ProKin PK254 mobile electronic platform.

The assessment sessions included measurements of dorsiflexion ROM, isometric and isokinetic plantar-flexion torque and proprioceptive performance with ARBOT and 2 minutes walking and timed stair climbing test, LEFS-Lower Extremity Functional Scale and AOFAS-Ankle-Hindfoot Scale.

Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 30 days prior to start of protocol therapy unless otherwise noted in the time to events table. Scans and x-rays must be performed within six weeks prior to the start of therapy. Bone marrow biopsy must be performed within twelve weeks prior to starting therapy. In the event that the patient's condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within 48 hours prior to initiation of the next cycle of therapy. All the labs have to be within the study eligibility range prior to the start of study treatment.

All visits should occur within 3 days before or after the scheduled day of the visit. An early or late visit will not shorten or extend the duration of that cycle - all cycles will be 28 days.

If study drug is held for any reason then the missed days should still be counted as a day in the cycle. However, if the study drug is on hold when a 28 day cycle ends, then day 1 of the next cycle and the necessary evaluations should not be started until drug is restarted. Therefore, the cycle during which a drug is held could potentially have more than 28 days.

Patients will be followed for up to 2 years after completion of therapy or until progression of disease or death, whichever comes first. In follow up, patients will be seen every 3 months for physical exam, lab draws for the first two years after completing all study drugs or until alternative therapy is begun or until progression of disease or death-whichever comes first. Radiographic imaging will be performed every 6 months for the first two years after study drug is completed.

For people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), this is caused by problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. NVAF happens more often in elderly people and can lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. Doctors are currently able to give patients a type of treatment called an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants work by making the blood thinner. They are thought to help reduce the risk of stroke and death caused by NVAF. In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about what elderly people think of taking anticoagulants that do not have any vitamin K in them. These are called non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs).

This study will include up to about 150 Belgian men and women aged 75 years and over who have NVAF and have been treated with NOACs. The study will also include about 10 doctors who have treated these patients.

In this study, there will be no required tests or visits. Instead, patients will answer a paper questionnaire about their use of NOACs. The researchers will ask the doctors questions about how they treat their patients using NOACs. The main types of questions the researchers will focus on are:

* The patient characteristics of the elderly with NVAF who are treated with NOACs
* The level of fear of the elderly about bleeding while using a blood thinner and the fear of stroke/thrombosis.
* The geriatrician's thoughts about using NOACs to treat NVAF in elderly patients
* Those patient characteristics geriatrician's find most important when deciding on the anticoagulation treatment in the elderly patients.

OTHER,NCT06424379,BCL6-rearrangements Implications in Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas.,"Study of Clinical, Histological, Immunohistochemical and Molecular Impact of BCL6 Gene Rearrangement in Most Prevalent Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas","Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) constitute a heterogeneous group of malignant neoplasms, with diverse clinical behaviors and distinct pathologic and molecular characteristics. Among these lymphomas, follicular lymphomas (FLs), marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) emerge as the most prevalent entities. While FL and MZL are representative of indolent B-cell lymphomas, characterized by a slow progression of the disease and favorable clinical outcomes, DLBCL stands out as an aggressive lymphoma, often occuring from the transformation of a pre-existing indolent lymphoma.

Chromosome translocations are a hallmark of some NHL subtypes, offering insights into their molecular pathogenesis. For instance, the conventional FL is genetically characterized by the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation, found in 85-90% of cases, resulting in sustained elevation of the antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). However, certain FL cases lack BCL2 translocations and exhibit distinct clinical, morphological and phenotypical features with genetic heterogeneity.

A subset of BCL2-negative FLs displays rearrangements within chromosomal region 3q27, inducing abnormal modulation of B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) expression. The BCL6 gene plays a critical role in germinal center development and B-cell differentiation. Previous investigations indicate that BCL6 rearrangements (BCL6-R) manifest distinct pathological and genetic features, diverging from classical FL presentations.

FLs carrying BCL6-R commonly share a specific CD10- Bcl-2- Bcl-6+ phenotype, often accompanied by a monocytoid component and increased frequency of diffuse architectural patterns. Patients with BCL6-R tend to exhibit advanced clinical stages and complex genetic profiles.

MZLs present differential diagnostic challenges due to shared monocytoid components, phenotypes traits, and common genetic features. The similarities observed between BCL6-R FL and MZL suggest a convergence in both morphological and genetic aspects, leading to intricate differentiation. Traditionally, these indolent NHLs with BCL6-R were categorized as FL and incorporated into the FL category in the WHO classification. However, few studies highlight the occurrence of BCL6-R in MZLs. This observation gives rise to the hypothesis that indolent NHLs exhibiting BCL6-R might correspond to a continuum comprising both FL and MZL.

Additionally, BCL6-R has been frequently documented in DLBCL cases with residual MZL component. These DLBCL cases might display a mutational profile reminiscent of MZL. This suggests a plausible origin of BCL6-R DLBCL from indolent BCL6-R MZLs or BCL6-R FLs cases.",,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2024-01-01,2025-06-30,2024-06-01,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,135,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Histopathological analysis"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Morphological analysis will include the description of architectural patterns and cytological features on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples retrieved from the routine diagnostic archives of the Pathology Department of the University Hospital Lyon Sud.\n\nA panel of immunohistochemical staining will be analyzed including CD20, CD3, CD10, Bcl-6, Bcl-2, CD5, CD23, CD38, MUM1, Ig kappa, Ig lambda, MEF2B, LMO2, MNDA, IRTA1, P53, CMYC and Ki67 . /MIB1.

OTHER,NCT06354179,Evaluation of the Benefits of Administering Immunosuppressive Drugs as Single Daily Doses Over the First Year After Liver Transplantation (EASY),Evaluation of the Benefits of Administering Immunosuppressive Drugs as Single Daily Doses Over the First Year After Liver Transplantation,"World Health Organization considers non-adherence has a strong negative impact on the health of patients with chronic diseases. In transplantation, adherence to immunosuppressive drug regimens associates with late rejection and graft loss making it a critical determinant of patient outcome. The prevalence of non-adherence in transplant patients, including liver transplant patients, can be as high as 40%. Among others, life-long intake and complexity of immunosuppressive regimen make patients prone to non-adherence. For instance, non-adherence is more prevalent among patients with higher numbers of immunosuppressive drugs. One of the most commonly cited causes of non-adherence is forgetfulness and disruptions in routine, with the evening dose of twice daily regimens being the most likely to be affected6. Besides non-adherence, the constraints generated in everyday life by immunosuppression (including timely and regular drug intake) and the complexity of the immunosuppressive regimens represent a burden for the patients and are probably associated with a health-related quality of life deterioration. Therefore, long-term adherence and quality of life after liver transplantation might be improved by using a well-tolerated and easy-to-handle immunosuppressive regimen.

The immunosuppressive regimen after liver transplantation is in most cases based on different combinations of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids. While corticosteroids are administered once daily, tacrolimus can be administered either twice-daily (BID) as an immediate-release, or once-daily (QD) as an extended-release formulation. Among once-daily tacrolimus formulations, LCP-tacrolimus (ENVARSUS XR®) is approved for the prevention of transplant rejection in adult liver allograft recipients. It has demonstrated similar outcomes compared to immediate-release tacrolimus BID, in both kidney and liver transplantation. Mycophenolate has only been approved for BID administration, preventing from taking all immunosuppressive drugs once daily. Yet, single daily dosing would probably contribute to better adherence and quality of life in patients receiving a life-long treatment.

Although the half-life of mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active moiety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is compatible with once-daily administration, no published randomized clinical study has ever evaluated the efficacy and safety of MMF administered QD.

The narrow therapeutic index and wide pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus and mycophenolate justify individual dose adjustment by means of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), in order to minimize the risk of acute rejection and the occurrence of adverse events. For tacrolimus, TDM is generally based on the trough concentration (C0) and sometimes on the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), while for mycophenolate it should be based on the AUC of MPA. However, the dose adjustment of MMF in liver transplant patients is most of the time performed a posteriori, based on clinical signs of inefficacy of toxicity.

Limited sampling strategies with maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation have been developed by our team for both molecules in adult liver transplant patients to estimate their AUC, which is considered the best marker of exposure for both. Therefore, tacrolimus AUC0-24h can be estimated by Bayesian estimation using samples collected before administration (C0), 8 (C8h) and 12 (C12h) hours after the administration of ENVARSUS XR®, or 1 and 3 hours after the administration of PROGRAF® and ADVAGRAF®. For mycophenolate, the MPA AUC can be estimated using samples collected 20 min, 1 and 3 hours after MMF administration, by Bayesian estimation.

Even if limited to 2 or 3 blood samples, tacrolimus TDM for ENVARSUS® requires late sampling (12h post-dose). To overcome the necessity of a longer hospital stay, microsampling devices (MSD) such as the Volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS®) device (Mitra®) can be used by the patients to take samples themselves, at home. Moreover, they are less invasive than venipuncture and collect low but accurate volumes of blood for analysis.

In this context, we propose a randomized controlled non-inferiority study to demonstrate that in liver transplant recipients, an immunosuppressive strategy based on single daily doses of LCP-tacrolimus (ENVARSUS XR®) and mycophenolate mofetil (CELLCEPT®) started at M6 post-transplantation is not inferior to XR-tacrolimus (ADVAGRAF®) and MMF administered BID, in terms of incidence of treatment failure (see below) at the end of the first year after transplantation, and to obtain adherence, quality of life and safety data. In order to compare solely MMF QD to MMF BID, patients on ENVARSUS XR® and MMF QD will be compared to a third group of patients receiving ENVARSUS XR® and MMF BID. A direct comparison of efficacy and safety, quality of life, adherence and exposure indices will be performed between ENVARSUS XR® and ADVAGRAF®.",,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2025-02-01,2028-02-01,2028-02-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,162,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""XR-tacrolimus QD + MMF BID then MMF QD"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Patients start on XR-Tacrolimus once daily (QD) and MMF twice daily (BID) as per the usual care.

OTHER,NCT05739279,Sarcopenia and Related Factors in Lipedema,Evaluation of Sarcopenia and Associated Factors in Patients with Lipedema,"Lipedema is a common disease of subcutaneous adipose tissue. The most common complaint of patients with swelling in the affected extremity is pain. In addition, patients with lipedema may experience conditions that can greatly affect the health and quality of life of the individual, such as loss of muscle strength and exercise capacity, and deterioration in activity levels of daily living. It is still unknown whether the decrease in muscle strength in patients with lipedema is part of this condition or whether decreased activity levels lead to decreased muscle strength.

Sarcopenia is an important health problem characterized by age-related loss of muscle mass and muscle function. The relationship between muscle weakness and sarcopenia in patients with lipedema has not been investigated before. Early recognition of possible sarcopenia and functional limitations in these patients may be important to increase the ability of patients to participate in physical activity as part of their conservative management.

There is no study in the literature investigating sarcopenia in patients with a diagnosis of lipedema. The aim of this study is to evaluate patients with a diagnosis of lipedema in terms of sarcopenia. In addition, the relationship between sarcopenia and age, body mass index, exercise frequency, lipedema type, and stage will be investigated in patients diagnosed with lipedema.","Lipedema is a chronic progressive condition in women characterized by a disproportionate increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue, accompanied by pain in the legs and sometimes the arms. It was first described in the 1940s and was expressed as fluid accumulation in the wide legs and legs due to subcutaneous fat deposition in the hips and lower extremities. Lipedema is characterized by bilateral enlargement from the hip to the ankle, often sparing the foot, due to abnormal deposition of subcutaneous fat, often with mild edema. The fact that many patients have pain and sensitivity has led to the use of the term painful fat syndrome. The disease usually begins at or just after puberty. Although some lipoedema patients are obese or overweight, the patients often have a normal appearance from the waist up and there is a disproportionate appearance between their trunk and lower extremities. Protection of the hands and feet is typical. This disease, which almost always affects women, has rarely been defined in men due to hormonal disorders or concomitant diseases such as cirrhosis. Although its prevalence is not known exactly, it is thought to be a much more common disease than expected because it is confused with other diseases such as obesity, venous insufficiency, and lymphedema and is a frequently missed diagnosis. Although the results of the studies vary, it has been reported that it is seen at a minimum rate of 1:72.000 or 11% of women affected by this disease.

The pathophysiology of lipoedema is multifactorial, and causes such as increased permeability and capillary fragility due to microangiopathy in adipose tissue, adipocyte necrosis due to hypoxia, and macrophage migration are prioritized. In addition, lymphatic drainage through HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1), VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), and FFA (Free Fatty Acid) increases and endothelial barrier function are affected, resulting in impaired vascular circulation due to fluid extravasation and fat accumulation. are held. Estrogen has effects on peripheral and central mechanisms and fat metabolism. The decrease in lipolysis in the femoral region and the increase in lipedema during periods of hormonal changes such as pregnancy, menopause, and oral contraceptive use suggest that hormonal mechanisms are effective on the disease. Preoptic and arcuate nuclei in the hypothalamus; It is involved in lipid mobilization and distribution of white adipose tissue and forms a pathway through ER α (estrogen receptor alpha) and its mediator CART (Cocaine and Amphetamine Regulatory Transcript). Disruption in this regulation pathway also results in regional adipose tissue deposition. There is a family history of 15-64% of the patients, and genetics is thought to be significantly effective. Pedigree studies indicate X-dominant or autosomal-dominant inheritance.

Lipedema usually presents with bilateral extremity swelling that begins in the post-adolescent period, is progressive, does not respond to diet and exercise, does not improve with elevation, and is spontaneous or painful to touch. Patients describe easy bruising with touch or minor trauma. Typically, the hands or feet are not involved, although this may involve the hip and gluteal region. On examination, the skin is often of normal color and texture, and oily hypertrophy may feel soft and pasty. Bruises caused by minor traumas can be observed during the examination. It does not leave pitting after long-term pressure is applied with the finger, and the Stemmer sign, which is observed by compressing the skin on the dorsum of the foot, is negative. Evaluation of these two findings is important in differentiating it from lymphedema. Lipedema consists of 5 major types:

* Type 1 pelvis, gluteal region, and hips,
* Type 2 extending from the gluteal region to the knees and with fat folds in the inner parts of the knees,
* Type 3 extending from the gluteal region to the ankles,
* Type 4 located in arms,
* Type 5 is defined as the presence of isolated swelling in the lower part of the legs.

Types 1-3 are the 3 most common. Lipedema can be seen in 3 stages. In stage 1, the skin surface is normal, the subcutaneous tissue is enlarged, and small nodules are present on palpation. In stage 2, the skin surface is irregular, and large fat nodules are seen. In stage 3, the skin contour is lobulated due to the increase in adipose tissue, and large nodules and deformities are observed. Some sources state the form of lipedema accompanied by lymphedema is stage 4, and this is called lipo lymphedema.

The diagnosis is made clinically, and the history and physical examination can be supported by assistive imaging techniques. The skin and subcutaneous tissue can be examined qualitatively and quantitatively by ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.

Sarcopenia is an important health problem characterized by age-related loss of muscle mass and muscle function. It is a harbinger of physical fragility and limitation of movement. Muscle wasting is mainly due to the loss of type II muscle fibers, and progressive motor neuron loss is thought to be the primary underlying factor. Anterior thigh muscles atrophy earlier and loss of anterior thigh muscle function may therefore be a precursor finding.

Experts in the sarcopenia special interest group (ISarcoPRM) under the umbrella of the International Society for Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (ISPRM) have developed a new algorithm based on regional measurements and functional assessments of the anterior thigh muscle, which is initially and most frequently affected in sarcopenia.

The iSarcoPRM has proposed a new measurement that uses anterior thigh muscle measurements for early assessment and rapid diagnosis of low muscle mass and confirmation of sarcopenia. Accordingly, STAR- (sonographic thigh adjustment ratio) sonographic thigh adjustment ratio is found by dividing anterior thigh muscle thickness by body mass index. Using two standard deviation values of healthy young adults, the threshold values for the sonographic thigh fit ratio were found to be 1.4 and 1.0 for male and female subjects, respectively.

As sarcopenia diagnostic criteria;

* STAR- (sonographic thigh adjustment ratio) sonographic thigh adjustment ratio below 1.4 and 1.0 for men and women, respectively
* For muscle strength measurement, hand grip strength is below 32 and 19 kg for men and women, respectively
* It is recommended that the 5-repeat stand-up test (CST (chair stand test)) be longer than 12 seconds.

It has been suggested that walking speed (6 meters) ≤0.8 m/s or inability to get up from a chair without support (limited movement) should be the primary outcome, not part of the diagnostic criteria.

Although pain is the most common complaint of patients with lipoedema along with swelling in the involved extremity, conditions such as loss of muscle strength and exercise capacity, and deterioration in daily life activity levels, can greatly affect the health and quality of life of the individual, can also be seen.

These patients have thickening of the lower extremities beginning in adolescence; limited exercise, dietary changes, or swelling of the affected extremities; they have a medical history that includes limitations in functionality such as fatigue, family history, inability to work, and loss of activity level.

It is still unknown whether the decrease in muscle strength in patients with lipoedema is part of this condition or whether decreased activity levels lead to decreased muscle strength. The relationship between muscle weakness and sarcopenia in these patients has not been investigated before. Early recognition of possible sarcopenia and functional limitations in this patient group may be important to increase the ability of patients to participate in physical activity as a part of conservative management.

Consequences of the inability to speak include: significant emotional distress; unrecognized pain; sleeplessness; increased use of restraints, self-extubation and line removal, as well as injury to self and healthcare professionals. Communication methods such as word mouthing, gesticulating, and writing may be ineffective and result in frustration. Recent technological innovations include communication boards and electronic speech generating devices however these require fine motor skills and coordination which may not be intact in the chronically critically ill. The Electrolarynx was recently shown to be effective in establishing communication in a case study of an intubated patient. Despite the well-recognized deleterious consequences of speech incapacity, few studies have evaluated communication strategies in the critically ill and no published study has evaluated the Electrolarynx in this patient population.

In this study, the investigators aim to assess the feasibility and patient acceptability of establishing speech with an Electrolarynx for intubated or tracheostomized patients experiencing difficult weaning and unable to tolerate cuff deflation. Feasibility will be determined by the proportion of participants able to produce intelligible and comprehensible speech. The investigators will also collect data on consent rates, reasons for refusal, the proportion of eligible patients and the time required for research procedures to inform future studies. The investigators will provide participants with a maximum of five Electrolarynx training sessions. On completion the investigators will measure speech intelligibility, comprehensibility, and patient acceptability using the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech and the Ease of Communication scale. Satisfaction with communication and anxiety will be measured before and after Electrolarynx training. To the investigators' knowledge, this study will be the first to rigorously evaluate, using previously validated measures, the feasibility of the Electrolarynx for establishing communication for mechanically ventilated patients.","Despite the well-recognized deleterious consequences of speech incapacity, few studies have evaluated communication strategies for patients unable to tolerate cuff deflation. Despite the aforementioned case reports, no studies report the feasibility of the Electrolarynx in restoring communication. Communication impairment during hospitalization has implications for the quality and safety of care as it is a modifiable risk factor for adverse events. This has led to accreditation organizations mandating reasonable efforts to establish alternative communication strategies for patients unable to speak. For chronically critically ill (CCI) patients, inability to speak increases anxiety, decreases a sense of control, and impairs meaningful patient involvement in decision making. Anxiety can exacerbate pain, which is known to impede ventilator weaning. Therefore it is likely that the inability to speak can impact negatively on weaning outcomes. To the investigators' knowledge, this study will be the first to rigorously evaluate, using previously validated measures, the feasibility of the Electrolarynx for establishing communication for mechanically ventilated patients.

Overall Program of Research Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that restoration of communication using the Electrolarynx can reduce patient anxiety resulting in improvement in weaning outcomes (weaning success and duration) and reduced adverse events associated with inability to communicate such as agitation, delirium, restraint use, and tube/line/device removal. Before being able to test this hypothesis, the feasibility of use of the Electrolarynx needs to be confirmed.

Study Aim The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of establishing speech with an Electrolarynx for patients receiving ventilation via an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy experiencing difficult weaning and unable to tolerate cuff deflation.

OTHER,NCT01870479,Music & Cancer - Live Music During Chemotherapy,Music & Cancer - Live Music During Chemotherapy. Randomized Study of the Effect of Live Music During Chemotherapy Treatment,"Main purpose: To determine if live music moderates the level of chemotherapy related anxiety, in patients with haematological cancer

The investigators hypothesize that live music:

1. Have an ameliorating effect on physical and psychological symptoms during chemotherapy treatment
2. May counteract the patients feeling of loss of identity and alienation in this particular group of cancer patients.
3. Is more effective in patients with good musical abilities.
4. Is more effective than taped music.

Method: Intervention groups:

1. Listening to patient-preferred live music during chemotherapy
2. Listening to patient-preferred taped music during chemotherapy
3. Standard care

Endpoints:

Primary: Level of anxiety measured by STAI. Secondary: Serum catecholamines.

Background: In order to establish the intervention procedures, the investigators have carried out a pilot study at the hematology department at Hospital of Southwest Denmark, including students from the Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, Southern Denmark. The pilot results indicates that live music has an uplifting, pain relieving, and then releasing effect and that music has a positive impact on hospitalisation. According to the evaluation forms filled out by 243 cancer patients, the music experience has provided human anchorage/cohesion as a counterweight to disease fixation and alienation Chemotherapy involves major physical and psychological problems. Not much has been provided in the clinical setting which relieves the symptoms of anxiety associated with chemotherapy. A review of the literature illustrate the need for developing new potential areas of intervention that takes into account, that not only do cancer patients face challenges in everyday life ranging from physiological changes over social to psychological problems, but also during treatment procedures, which may cause a higher level of anxiety associated with these procedures, e.g., chemotherapy infusion.This project investigates to what degree live music may relieve some of these symptoms during treatment for haematological cancer. The project is created in order to both measure psychosocial effects as well as direct stress measures, i.e. serum catecholamine. These physiological changes are measured in order to shed light on the mechanism behind the potential effects of live music on discomfort in connection with chemotherapy treatment.

Perspectives: The vision of the project focus on strengthening the cancer patients' ability to cope with physiological and psychological issues during chemotherapy sessions and to make the patients conscious of music as an option in these coping efforts. Hopefully, the results will provide a scientific basis for an evaluation of the perspectives and the potentials of live music treatment during chemotherapy infusion among cancer patients.",,COMPLETED,,2013-05,2017-03,2017-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,143,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Live music"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Taped music"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER;OTHER,live music;taped music,1

The aims of this study are:

Primary aim:

To observe if the postoperative dietary energy intake (kJ/kcal) of older adult hip fracture patients meets Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) needs.

Secondary aims:

To explore if there is a correlation between postoperative dietary intake and length of hospital stay.

To explore the relationship between comorbidity (where reported) and postoperative dietary intake, according to dietary intake.

To explore (if) in the development of postoperative complications (infection, pressure ulcer and VTE), there is a correlation with postoperative dietary intake.","A hip fracture is one of the most serious injuries that an older adult can sustain and with the current projections from the NHS Long Term Workforce plan of an increase in \>85yrs by 55% and a current estimation of over 75,000 hip fractures per year in England, Northern Ireland and Wales with a 6-8% mortality rate at 1 year, this warrants further research to improve outcomes and look at methods beyond the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) to ascertain what more can be done to optimise and improve this patient group. Whilst ONS supplementation is used on an ad-hoc basis for patients with a high-risk malnutrition screening score of 2 using the MUST screening method, such tools can lack sensitivity and accuracy and are also not developed to identify the development of malnutrition in-hospital.

The proposed study for this protocol is an observation study of the dietary intake of older adult hip fracture patients. The study will comprise of a weighed food diary, commencing on day zero after surgery. Potential participants that will be invited will be older adult hip fracture patients (\>60yrs) with a confirmed hip fracture diagnosis that requires surgical repair. The diary will consist of the researcher weighing the plate of food before and after the participant's meal as this is regarded as a more accurate measure than relying on participant recall and does not place the participant under any additional stress.

The researcher will not handle any food, and plates will be placed on a digital scale. Should a food have a specified weight - for example a yoghurt, the weight on the product will be recorded. Fluid intake will be recorded according to drinks served with meals and jugs of water per day. After each meal the researcher will weigh the plate; if it is a multiple item meal (for example meat, potatoes, and vegetables), the researcher will weigh the leftover components individually to ensure the validity of the weighed food method and to achieve the highest degree of accuracy possible. The researcher will not be present nor disrupt the participant during their meal. After their meal, the researcher will ask the participant if they have had any additional snacks and observe if they have had any assistance with their meal. Data will also be obtained regarding the times of meals, the ratio of staff to patients and if any complications have developed.

The aim of this study is to explore the postoperative dietary intake of older adult hip fracture patients until day three after surgery. This builds on research where data on hip fracture patients was taken in relation to diet, anthropometry, and biochemical indices during inpatient stays. Whilst the study was commenced in the second week post-surgery and compared against values at the week 1 admission as a baseline, the researchers observed a longer length of stay, drops in energy intake that coincided with a low BMI on admission and additionally, referrals for high-risk patients that were not actioned.

Subsequent studies have used varied interventions to explore postoperative nutrition, however a weighed food diary has yet to be used in the immediate postoperative period, which justifies the need for this study to explore nutritional intake as accurately as possible.",RECRUITING,,2024-05-13,2024-08-31,2024-07-31,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,30,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Observational"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Observational prospective study"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER,observational,0

In order to reduce the number of venepunctures, totally implanted venous access devices (TIVAD) or Ports have been used to administer antibiotics and other infusions.

The use of Port systems has been increasing in recent years, especially for those patients requiring frequent intravenous treatments. Having a TIVAD in place makes venous access quicker and also reduces trauma, suffering and pain. However, there are important complications associated with TIVADs which can be early (pneumothorax, arterial puncture, severe bruising) or late (infections, thromboembolic complications and occlusion).

Although the use of TIVADs in CF is increasing, there is little CF-specific literature available on the epidemiology and risk of TIVAD complications. Also, literature is scarce about clinical criteria for deciding to insert a TIVAD. Therefore, so far clinical decisions were based mainly on experiences of TIVAD use in other diseases, such as cancer.

With this prospective observational study we will survey a large population of Italian CF people with TIVAD in order to: collect data about current clinical conditions of CF people with TIVAD; investigate about clinical criteria that led to the decision of positioning a TIVAD; observe the possible onset of late complications.","To be included in the study, subjects need to fulfil the following requirements:

Although ivermectin demonstrated potent in vitro action by reducing viral load by 5000x after 48 hours of incubation, simultaneous pharmacokinetics simulations suggested that the minimum effective concentrations would be unfeasible to be reached within safety range (EC-50 = 2 Micromol).

However, despite the theoretical unfeasible concentrations to be achieved, preliminary observational yet well-structured studies followed by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated ivermectin efficacy when combined with hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline or azithromycin, which was corroborated by a recent systematic review and metanalysis. In common, a dose-response effect for effectiveness was observed, and no adverse effects was reported at any dose between 0.2mg/kg/day and 1.0mg/kg/day.

Based on the scientific rationale combined with the preliminary evidence, ivermectin has sufficient evidence to be tested in higher doses in a RCT for COVID-19. The investigators propose to test ivermectin at high doses as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19, aiming to explore the possible protective role of high-dose ivermectin in SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of reduction of clinic and virologic disease duration, and prevention of oxygen use, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death, and post-COVID persisting symptoms.","Overall

COVID-19 is a multisystemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has become a pandemic largely due to a combination of favorable transmission and infection characteristics for its spread, including prolonged preclinical or also asymptomatic yet transmitting period, relatively highly resistant to mechanical and physical barriers and prolonged survival in the air, and transmission patterns not yet fully elucidated.

While vaccines are not widely available, the number of new cases should not decrease dramatically, unfortunately, since a large percentage of the population has not been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 yet, reinfection becomes increasingly plausible with mutations in the virus, and virus contention policies failed to be 100% effective.

Considering potential antiviral approaches for COVID-19, their effectiveness only make sense if tested and given early in the disease, during viral dissemination. The learning that oseltamivir is only effective for Influenza A in the first three days of disease finds strong plausibility, and reinforces the expected lack of effectiveness of any drug with in vitro or preliminary antiviral activity reported when tested in hospitalized or non-mild patients, once COVID-19 presents tend to present mild symptoms during the viral dissemination stage.

An actual early detection of COVID-19, i.e., before its progression to further inflammatory stages, is challenging, once the earliest symptoms tend to be unspecific, mild, and hardly attributable to COVID-19. By suspecting of COVID-19 in the presence of any symptom, specific to COVID-19 or not, sensitivity was met to be above 90% while specificity was also relatively high (above 50%). In addition, time-to-treat, rather than which drug to choose, could better determine the effectiveness of a specific approach.

Ivermectin: potential antiviral activity for COVID-19

Among drugs potentially effective for COVID-19, despite the classical antiparasitic and anti-scabies use, ivermectin has demonstrated antiviral activity for a variety of viruses by inhibiting and reducing the viral shedding duration, including chikungunya and other alphaviruses, zyka virus, dengue virus and other simple-strain RNA viruses.

In the search for drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, considering its effects on other viruses, ivermectin was tested in a Vero-hSLAM cell model and demonstrated potent in vitro action, by reducing viral load by 5000x after 48 hours of incubation. However, after initial promising results, simultaneous pharmacokinetics simulations suggested that the minimum effective concentrations would be unfeasible to be reached within safety range (EC-50 = 2 Micromol).

Although the theoretical minimum concentration required for antiviral action was apparently at least 17 times higher than the lethal dose and up to 10,000 times the usually prescribed doses for humans ( IC50 of 2.2 - 2.8 µM for monkeys), which would reduce the chances of ivermectin efficacy for COVID-19, preliminary observational yet well-structured studies demonstrated substantial synergistic action of ivermectin when added to ""standard of care"", usually hydroxychloroquine with or without macrolides. In a specific study, the use of ivermectin, even in low doses, reduced by 40% the absolute risk of death among patients more severely affected by COVID-19.

Some randomized clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated efficacy of ivermectin when combined with hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline or azithromycin, in both mildly (and presumedly early) and more severely affected subjects with COVID-19. Demonstrated benefits included lower disease progression and reduced COVID-related mortality.

In comparative analyses, combinations between ivermectin and azithromycin, doxycycline or hydroxychloroquine demonstrated superiority compared to combinations between hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or hydroxychloroquine alone.

The exact mechanisms of action remain nuclear. At least one study employing higher doses (0.6mg/kg/day) demonstrated in vivo antiviral activity, but only when maximum concentration reached serum levels above 160 ng/ml, which only occurred in 45% of subjects, even at higher doses. The antiviral mechanisms include modification in the ACE-2 glycation patterns, inhibition of the viral Helicase (NSP13) and disruption of the alpha-importin heterodimer.

In a recent systematic review and metanalysis, a dose-response correlation has also been observed in terms of endpoints, reinforcing the role of ivermectin as actins as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 action drug. However, even in lower doses ivermectin was able to demonstrate clinical benefits, allowing the hypothesis that ivermectin also exerts anti-inflammatory effects, which could include the blockage of STAT-1 migration to the nucleus, and could justify its use even at later stages of the disease.

Collectively, higher yet safe ivermectin doses find stronger plausibility and preliminary evidence to be tested in RCTs. In addition, approaches to increase ivermectin absorption and bioavailability should be encouraged.

Based on the scientific rationale combined with preliminary evidence, ivermectin has sufficient evidence to be tested at higher doses in a RCT for COVID-19. The investigators propose to test ivermectin at high doses as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19.

A non-union is a lack of bone healing (bone growth where the break in the bone occurred) after 3 months after the operation. The diaphyseal is an area of a specific bone (usually near the middle) where the fracture occurred. The bones we are interested in are the clavicle (collar bone), tibia (lower leg), femur (upper leg), humerus (upper arm) and forearm (lower arm). Treatment goals for these types of fractures are to minimize later surgeries, to assist the healing process, and to decrease the time to healing. The ability of a patient with non-union (lack of bone healing after 3 months post operation) to return to the work force and to normal activities more quickly not only has a good financial impact on society (community), but also improves over-all physical and mental well-being of the patients.

""Infuse"" is a synthetic bone morphogenic protein which means it has the ability to help your bone to form and heal if inserted in the fracture site. ""Infuse"" may be the first commercially available product approved by Health Canada to accelerate the healing of long bone non-unions requiring surgical intervention.

Although the safety and efficacy of Infuse has been demonstrated through numerous pre-clinical studies, further human clinical trial is needed to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of this product particularly with respect to non unions of long bones. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects of Infuse implanted during treatment of long bone non unions to reduce later surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.

Given this, the orthopaedic community has planned this study in order to scientifically establish the most effective treatment method to restore function after this type of injury.","We propose a multi-centre Canadian randomized Study wherein 80 patients are randomized (put in groups by no standard pattern ie. flipping a coin) to receive both autograft (sample of your own bone: iliac crest) and allograft (bone chips from bone bank) or ""infuse"" (synthetic bone morphogenic protein) and allograft using locked plates. Locked plates are surgical plates placed on the fracture in which the screws lock into the plate when they have been completely screwed into the bone through holes on the plate. Our objective is to assess the total cost of the patients treated in both study group and the benefits of the Infuse by comparing the new bone formation in the fracture site.

We will monitor critical aspects of operative care and rehabilitation at regular intervals, up to 2 year after surgery.

OTHER,NCT02894879,Effectiveness Of Modified Chest PT Technidue In Pre And Post-Operative Program In Patients Open Heart Surgery,Effectiveness of Modified Chest Physical Therapy Techniques Using New Device in Pre and Post-operative Program in Patients Undergoing Open Heart Surgery.,The purpose of this study is to explore effectiveness of modified chest physical therapy techniques using new device in pre and post-operative program in patients undergoing open heart surgery,"Postoperative pulmonary complications, PPCs are common after open heart surgery. The causes of PPCs is complex and involve numerous factors in cardiac surgery including general anesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass technique, median sternotomy, internal mammary artery dissection, topical cooling for myocardial protection, process of surgery, pulmonary risk factor of patients preoperative and on intubation. These factors could lead to pain and change in breathing pattern and induced respiratory muscle dysfunction. Causes of restriction lung volume, reduced lung volume, impaired airway clearance and secretion accumulation lead to poor ventilation and gas exchange. These are major contributing factors of PPCs e.g. atelectasis and pneumonia, which increase the load on cardiac function. The cardio-respiratory dysfunction could result in prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilator dependence in ICU and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Also, PPCs increase use of medical resources, extend the length of hospital stays and increase hospital costs .

The reducing of PPCs need the chest physical therapy (CPT) to solve this problem. The goals of CPT are to increase lung volume, improve airway secretion clearance, and improve physical ambulation and movement. The CPT techniques are composed of deep breathing exercise, coughing and huffing, force expiratory technique, percussion and vibration, and early mobilization and change of position. However, these complications were still available and high incidence. May be, because CPT techniques are urged pain, not to clear secretion, the patients has not enough time to performed the CPT techniques in preoperative period and the atelectasis occurred immediately after surgery. But CPT in patients after cardiac surgery is mostly training after extubation. So, CPT have develops new technique or breathing device for increase lung volume and improve airway secretion clearance without increasing pain to reduce the incidence of PPCs.

Incentive spirometry (IS) device is a widely used for the prophylaxis and treatment of respiratory complications in postsurgical patients. The previous study suggested that IS training could reduce an incidence of PPCs. However, several publications have controversisce results the effectiveness of IS when compared other chest physical therapy in preventing PPCs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Recent studies suggested that in patients undergoing cardiac surgery no evidence of benefit from IS to prevent PPCs, improving pulmonary function and oxygenation and reducing the length of a hospital when compared with preoperative education or standard postsurgical physical therapy. The comparison the effectiveness between IS and conventional postoperative chest physical therapy showed that did not difference. This may be caused by IS device in there studied not enough increase lung volume especially lower lung, this is often found atelectasis. Moreover, this device has not a property of airway clearance, which the secretion accumulation is a primary cause of PPCs.

Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) device was popular used in patients after cardiac surgery practically and demonstrated to reduce the incidence of PPCs. Due to, the PEP technique can prevent the closure of the trachea during exhalation, resulting the increase of lung volumes and the mobilization of secretions. Earlier study had compared the effect of different deep breathing exercise, on PPCs after CABG surgery. However, in such studies there studies to immediate effects of 30 deep breaths performed with or without a mechanical device on atelectasis after 2 days surgery, and did not perform adequate follow-up. A resulting lack of evidence indicating that PEP technique in clinical practice, the patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Due to, in routine treatment, the breathing exercise is repeated every daytime and for several days. It is not unlikely that repeated practice will have a more substantial effect. Moreover, Westerdahl et al. (2003) found that the aerated lung area was increase in the IS+PEP group, when compared to the PEP with deep breathe group. This data is an interesting point that, if the patients practice breathing exercise with IS+PEP at 30 breathes every daytime and several days maybe the difference between patients practice IS+PEP and chest physical therapy on the incidence of PPCs in patients cardiac surgery.

The study of the effect of IS+PEP on reducing the incidence of PPCs compared to respiratory physiotherapy intervention in patients undergoing cardiac surgery was a few studied. Westerdahl et al. (2001) studied on the effectiveness of three deep breathing techniques in male patients after CABG surgery and the results found that the occurrence of atelectasis was no statistical difference between IS+PEP group, compared to deep breath and PEP group. This result is contrastly to the results of Haeffener et al., (2008). In patients undergoing CABG surgery, combinated treatment with IS and EPAP helped to reduction the PPCs significantly. However, the studied has a limitation of methodology due to the patients are not comprehensive.

Thus, this study was interested in the effects of practicing IS combine PEP to reduce the incidence of PPCs, especially atelectasis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery by BreatheMAX® v.2. Due to, BreatheMAX has been developed and manufactured in Thailand, breathing device has multiple functions with cheaper price and easy. Moreover, IS of BreatheMAX has a humidified and vibrate mechanisms during inhaling, thus it can reduce the viscosity of secretion and increases the ability to remove secretions without causing a dry mouth. The obstruction of secretions is the primary cause of atelectasis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. But other devices are manufacture in abroad and single function, make time to use several functions need for multiple devices.

In order to prevent PPCs, the patients have to be well trained all the CPT techniques used in postoperative period with a physiotherapist. However, in clinical practice patients are always admitted hospital just 1-2 days before the operation, and there is not enough time to practice the CPT techniques. In addition, the taught of CPT techniques may be challenging and redundant to practice in short time. To solve this problem, the illustrated CPT techniques have to be selected and directed toward airway clearance, and alveolar recruitment effects also need to be fewer and efficient techniques feasible to do easily by the post-operative patients. Consequently, apart from huffing or coughing, using the proper breathing device would be easier and enjoy the way of practice and acceptable by the vulnerable patients during pre-operative period. IS and PEP techniques will be selected because of their therapeutic effects. However, there is no evidence supporting the effectiveness of the IS and PEP techniques in pre-operative and continue in post-operative period in order to prevent PPCs. The hypothesized scope that if the patients can learn and do the techniques well, at before and after operative period, the PPCs can reduced or prevented which could result to prevent or reduce the incidence of PPCs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative physical therapy program (Oscillated PEP + Oscillated IS) on the PPCs in patients who underwent cardiac surgery.

In conclusion, this research proposal has to study the effectiveness of Oscillated PEP and Oscillated IS (OPEP+OIS) techniques compare deep breathing exercise conduct pre-operative and continue post-operative period on the incidence of PPCs, especially atelectasis, the length of a mechanical ventilator, the length of intubation, and length of ICU and hospital stay.",UNKNOWN,,2016-09,2017-04,2017-04,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,48,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""BreatheMAX®"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Modify chest physical therapy\n\n* oscillated incentive spirometry (OIS) with inspiratory load of 5-8 cm H2O 30 times/set\n* oscillated positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) with expiratory load of 5-8 cm H2O 30 times/set\n* Coughing with splinting 3 times/set\n* Chest mobilization with overhead both arms rises 10 times/set total 5 set/day"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Routine treatment"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Routine chest physical therapy\n\n* Deep breathing exercise (upper and lower costal and diaphragmatic breathing exercise) as deep as possible for 10 times/set/level\n* Coughing with splinting 3 times/set\n* Chest mobilization with overhead both arms raised 10 times/set total 5 set/day"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE;OTHER,breathemax®;routine treatment,0

OTHER,NCT02690779,Bowel Preparation Quality for Screening Colonoscopy,Impact of a Patient Educational Video on Bowel Preparation Quality for Screening Colonoscopy: a Quality Assurance Project,The study will consist of a prospective observational period performed in the GI Endoscopy Lab. The objective is to document the quality of bowel preps in patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy with and without an educational intervention.,"The educational intervention will consist of a 2-3 minute video demonstrating video images of adequate and inadequate bowel preps, and reviewing instructions for split dose prep administration. This video will be posted on YouTube. Group 1 will consist of 30 subjects who will be instructed to view this video prior to beginning their colonoscopy preparation. Information to access the YouTube video will be provided to the patients by endoscopy nurse assessment staff when contacting the patients as per standard practice to review appointment scheduling and procedure-day logistics. Group 2 will consist of 30 subjects who will not receive instructions to view the video.

Nursing staff will be asked to grade bowel preps according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), a validated and reliable instrument for assessing quality of bowel preparation \[6\]. Using the BBPS, a four point scoring system is applied to each of the three broad regions of the colon: the right side of the colon (including the cecum and ascending colon), the transverse section of the colon (including the hepatic and splenic flexures), and the left side of the colon (including the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum). The points are assigned as follows: (0), unprepared colon segment, (1), portion of the mucosa of the colon segment seen, (2), minor amount of residual staining, (3), entire mucosa of colon segment seen well. The three segment scores are then summed for a total BBPS score, which ranges from 0 to 9. The maximum BBPS score for a perfectly clean colon without any residual liquid is 9, and the minimum BBPS score for an unprepared colon is 0. The endoscopy nurse who is in the procedure room will be scoring the bowel preparation. This protocol has been employed previously in the VUMC Endoscopy Lab and the endoscopy nurses at Vanderbilt have completed a detailed in-service training session on using the BBPS scoring system. Prior to initiation of this current study protocol, the endoscopy nurses will have a BBPS scoring system review session to ensure continued reliable and valid BBPS scores.

This procedure is known as MKTP (Melanocyte Keratinocyte Transplantation Procedure). Multiple studies have found this procedure to be both safe and effective for the treatment of vitiligo. The majority of these studies utilized trypsin to help isolate melanocytes and keratinocytes. Trypsin is enzyme that helps to separate the different layers of skin. However, some cell biologists believe that the enzyme dispase (which can be used to separate the epidermis from the dermis) is less toxic to cells of the epidermis and can result in a greater number of viable melanocytes and keratinocytes for transplantation.

FED,NCT06312579,At-Home Exercise Study for Veterans With Healed Diabetic Foot Ulcers,Home-based Exercise to Improve Functional Outcomes in Veterans With Recently Healed Diabetic Foot Ulcer,"Foot ulcers and amputations are a common and feared complication for people with diabetes. People with a diabetic foot ulcer have a higher risk of dying within five years than people with diabetes without an ulcer. At least one in four people with a new diabetic foot ulcer will die within five years, largely due to cardiovascular causes. The reasons for this increased mortality involve decreased mobility.

People with a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer are considered ""in remission"" as opposed to ""cured"" because the underlying medical problems which led to their ulcer are still present. Once in remission, the current standard of care is to slowly increase ambulation. The problem is that people rarely return to the recommended level of mobility. The ability to safely maintain mobility with aging is critical.

This pilot study is a small clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of a home-based exercise regimen. The investigators will also assess if this home-based exercise regimen can increase mobility and function without increasing diabetic foot ulcer recurrence by improving lower extremity strength, lower extremity tissue perfusion and glycemic control.","Population: 25 Veterans with a healed foot ulcer in the last 3-15 months

This means that nursing education should prepare nursing students to meet the needs of patients, serve as leaders, develop scientific rigor for the benefit of patients, and make decisions based on critical thinking. In addition to transferring theoretical knowledge, nursing education is also very important in terms of putting students' knowledge into practice and improving students' comprehensive qualifications.","One of these qualities is the fundamental responsibility of nurses to ensure patient safety. It is estimated that 421 million hospitalizations occur every year in the world. Approximately 7.42 million adverse events occur during these hospitalizations, and patient harm is the 14th leading cause of global mortality. Many universities are looking for teaching methods that can improve students' clinical decision-making abilities and self-directed learning in order to provide safe and quality nursing care. Lack of patient safety knowledge is one of the educational problems of nursing students leading to unsafe practices.Early education on patient safety is crucial in preparing nurses to be competent in patient care. Therefore, offering patient safety education courses at the undergraduate level using an innovative approach is important to improve patient safety and quality in nursing care.

Various innovative approaches are used in nursing education to improve students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These include team-based learning, concept mapping, case studies and problem-based learning (PBL) and flipped classroom model. In the flipped classroom model, students are presented with course materials prior to class and then class time is spent gaining in-depth understanding through interactive activities. Studies have shown that the flipped classroom model improves students' academic performance and satisfaction. However, compared to traditional lecture-based classes, reverse classes have been reported to be more effective in improving academic performance and course evaluation as well as developing engagement and higher-order thinking skills in nursing students. Problem-based learning (PBL), one of the important teaching methods that improve nursing students' clinical performance and critical thinking skills, can be used as an in-class activity in flipped classrooms. However, some studies indicate that the simple implementation of PBL instruction can challenge students' systematic understanding of the required knowledge and that this model is more difficult for students with low learning ability and performance, resulting in learning fatigue and worse learning outcomes than expected. Several studies have explored the combined use of reverse classrooms and PBL in nursing education. However, it is important to investigate how to maximize the impact of pre-course self-study to promote the development of students' abilities. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of patient safety education provided by combining the flipped classroom model with problem-based learning within the scope of nursing management course on nursing students' patient safety knowledge, attitudes and perceptions.",COMPLETED,,2024-10-07,2025-01-20,2025-01-20,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,OTHER,70,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Flipped Method"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""In the first week of the clinical practice, the E-learning module prepared by the researchers within the scope of the flipped education method was shared with the intervention group students and all students were shown in a conference room.

INDUSTRY,NCT03724279,Crossing Atheroma or Thrombus With ByCross Device for Revascularization of Peripheral Arteries of Diameter ≥ 3mm,"Safety and Effectiveness of ByCross Rotational and Aspiration Device for Revascularization of Total or Sub-total Occluded Peripheral Arterial Vessels of Luminal Diameter Equal to or Larger Than 3mm: A Prospective, Multi-center Study","The aim of the study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of ByCross Rotational and Aspiration device used for revascularization of total or sub-total occluded peripheral arterial vessels equal to or larger than 3mm in diameter.

The ByCross is a single use, disposable, minimal invasive aspiration rotational atherectomy device. The ByCross is aimed to enable effective revascularization and restore blood flow in peripheral occluded vessels. In cases that the artery is completely blocked such that opening is not possible with currently available solutions and the procedure cannot be completed, the device is capable of crossing the blocked lesion without guiding wire and enables the completion of the procedure in a safe and effective manner, thus potentially eliminating the need for open bypass surgery. The ByCross can be used in several pathologies: calcified atheroma, old and fresh thrombus.

Eligible adult patients with symptoms due to chronic sub-total and total occlusion will be enrolled and undergo percutaneous procedure including use of ByCross which will normally be followed by balloon inflation (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty) in the artery at location where blockage has been opened by ByCross to further open the artery and restore full opening, and in some case followed by placement of a stent for long term stabilization.

For demonstrating safety and effectiveness up to 42 patients will be enrolled. the procedure will take up to 2 hours followed by up to 48 hour hospitalization. Patients will then come for follow-up monitoring and examination 30 days and 6 months after procedure. Although this is unlikely, in some cases the physician can decide during procedure that following ByCross opening of the artery, ballooning or stent is not required. In this case the patient will come for another follow-up visit after 12 month.","Occlusive vascular disease (OVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the Western world. Arterial obstructions generally start as a build-up of harder atherosclerotic material on which clotted blood (thrombus) forms, whereas veins obstruction contains mostly thrombus. Over 10 million patients in the US suffer from peripheral arterial disease (PAD) including 750,000 critical limb ischemia patients who are at risk of limb amputation.

The existing pharmacological and bypass surgical methods to treat OVD are risky, expensive, and time-consuming. Overcoming these shortcomings presents a substantial opportunity for a mechanical catheter. Atherectomy with mechanical catheters has been used clinically for many years, and by now the clinical outcome of atherectomy is known as reflected by multiple clinical studies. The potential benefit of the technique compared with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and/or Stenting alone or as an adjunctive therapy has also been discussed, and more recently as an adjunctive prior to PTA with a drugeluting balloon and stenting. The existing catheters designed mainly for arteries are expensive, complicated to operate, demonstrate limited reduction in level of stenosis, might cause perforations, distal embolization and hemolysis, have no or poor aspiration, and cannot cross occlusions without passage of guidewire first. Despite the common use of these therapies and current benefits, there remain significant opportunities to extend catheter-based treatments with improved outcomes, to more patients and at lower cost.

The ByCross is a minimal invasive, single use atherectomy and thrombectomy device, which is introduced over the wire into the peripheral vasculature for revascularization of chronic occluded peripheral vessels. The ByCross has a coaxial flexible rotating shaft with an expandable tip and integrates an independent aspiration system for suction of thrombotic material. The expandable tip is an elastic arc that can bow and enlarge the tip diameter from external tip diameter of 1.7mm at closed condition to 4.7mm at open condition. As the shaft rotates, the tip breaks the calcified atheroma or thrombus into small particles, which are simultaneously aspired into the shaft and removed into the attached collection bag. The ByCross allows injection of contrast medium and thrombolytic agents through the rotating tip during the procedure for continuance imaging and prevention of appositional thrombus formation. Due to its no-symmetrical helical design the tip rotation is eccentric, causing the tip to recenter is self within the lumen as it rotates. While ByCross is introduced over a guide wire, it does not require the passage of an occlusion with the wire first. To cross the occlusion the ByCross is advanced with running motor forth and back in a closed condition. Once the occluded segment is crossed the procedure is repeated with open tip at larger diameter vessels to further remove the remaining atheroma or thrombus. The ByCross is battery powered, and includes a remote-control unit which allows the user full ergonomic control of the device next to the puncture site.

Based on compliance with standard requirements, design process and risk analysis process. The risk of occurrence of adverse events is not expected to be greater than the risk reported for other devices available in the market today. More over the past animal test supports the expected low risk. This study, aside to performance investigation, is intended to validate this. The potential significant advantage of the ByCross device in the treatment of chronic limb ischemia is the ability to cross Chronic Total Occlusion (calcified atheroma and/or thrombus, in oppose to other atherectomy devices which can only cross partial occluded vessel due to the necessity of progressing over the wire). Thus, instead of aborting the procedure, completion of revascularization procedure percutaneously is possible. In addition, the ByCross enables, due to its design, to achieve superior patency, injection of contrast medium and antiplatelet during operation of the radio-opaque tip, and enables simultaneous aspiration.

These benefits potentially reduce prolonged percutaneous procedures if other means are required to enable chroni total occlusion (CTO) passage by guidewire, and, might, in the future, reduce the number of bypass surgeries in peripheral arteries, all with no risk compared to long term clinical use of equivalent devices.

Information gathered in this study will further assure the ByCross device as superior solution enabling more beneficial minimal invasive procedure for the subjects with the same indication for treatment.

The study is multi-center, single arm, open label, prospective study. 42 patients with total or subtotal occlusion at target vessel bearing length equal to or larger than 3cm at vessels diameter of 3mm or larger will be enrolled to the study. Eligible consented subjects will undergo a procedure and treated with the ByCross device. Additional adjunctive treatment (such as PTA, stenting etc.) may be performed per physician's discretion and according to standard of care. Assessment of device safety and performance will be performed intra and post procedural, at discharge, at 30 days post procedure and at 6 months. Subjects that will undergo procedure using ByCross only with NO adjunctive therapy will be followed-up at 12 months as well. The overall duration of participation for each subject is expected to be up to 7 months and 13 months for those that undergo procedure using ByCross only.

Primary outcome measures are divided into two: performance and safety. The null hypotheses will be tested via the lower limit of the one-sided 95% exact confidence interval for the respective proportions. The expected Acute Procedural Success rate is 95% as is the rate of subjects free of device-related Major Adverse Events (MAEs) throughout a 30-day follow-up. The sample size required to achieve a lower one-sided 95% exact confidence limit that is greater than 85%, if the point estimate of the proportion is 95%, is calculated as 40 patients. To accommodate a potential 5% drop-out prior to completing 30 days follow-up, up to 42 patients may be required to be enrolled.",COMPLETED,,2018-09-24,2019-10-09,2019-07-01,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,42,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""ByCross Atherectomy and Thrombectomy"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""After assessment of the lesion by angiography the ByCross is advanced over a 0.035\"" guidewire through a sheath to the occlusion.

On days 3 and 4, laboratory tests (blood and urine) will be done to evaluate liver and kidney function. On day 4, the catheter will be removed and the patient will be discharged from the hospital. A follow-up visit will be scheduled 1 week after discharge for a physical examination and blood, urine and EKG tests.","Essential tremor is a very common movement disorder affecting approximately 1.4% of the population. Response to medications such as beta blockers and mysoline may be only partial or be accompanied by intolerable side effects. Roughly 80% of patients have significant tremor reduction to ethanol although daily use of this as a treatment has potentially serious social and legal consequences. The leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology of essential tremor is unmasking of spontaneous oscillation of neurons in the inferior olive. Both ethanol and 1-octanol have been shown to reduce these spontaneous oscillations in an animal model of essential tremor; however, 1-octanol dose this at a dose much lower than an intoxicating dose suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of essential tremor. Our initial study with 1-octanol at a low, single dose in patients with essential tremor suggested it was both efficacious and safe.

This present study is planned to identify a maximum tolerated dose and broaden the safety and efficacy data in humans. Additionally, we hope to collect further information about the pharmacokinetics of 1-octanol. This study is designed as a phase Ia, unblinded, inpatient study of adults with essential tremor receiving escalating doses of 1-octanol. Cohorts of three will begin dose escalation at the dose previously studied. Each cohort will be followed in inpatient setting for 72 hours ( and outpatient for 1 additional week) during which adverse events, pharmacokinetics and efficacy will be assessed. If no subject achieves dose-limiting toxicity, 3 additional subjects will be recruited to receive the next higher dose. If 1/3 subjects achieves dose-limiting toxicity, the next cohort will receive the same dose. Dose limiting toxicity is defined as the dose that produces dose-limiting toxicity in at least 2 subjects. Maximum tolerated dose will be defined as the next lower dose.

With this study, we hope to identify a range of doses that may useful in the treatment of essential tremor and combined with the pharmacokinetic and efficacy data, design a protocol to study multiple dose regimens over longer time periods.",COMPLETED,,2001-05,2004-03,,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,,,,TREATMENT,42,,"[{""name"": ""1-Octanol"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,1-octanol,1
NIH,NCT00043979,Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With High-Risk and Recurrent Pediatric Sarcomas,Pilot Study of Allogeneic/Syngeneic Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With High-Risk and Recurrent Pediatric Sarcomas,"This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplantation for treating patients with sarcomas (tumors of the bone, nerves, or soft tissue). Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow and blood stream that develop into blood cells. Stem cells transplanted from a healthy donor travel to the patient's bone marrow and begin producing normal cells. In patients with certain cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, the donor's immune cells attack the patient's cancer cells in what is called a ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect, contributing to cure of the disease. This study will determine whether this treatment can be used successfully to treat patients with sarcomas.

Patients between 4 and 35 years of age with a sarcoma that has spread from the primary site or cannot be removed surgically, and for whom effective treatment is not available, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have been diagnosed by the age of 30 at the time of enrollment. They must have a matched donor (usually a sibling). Participants undergo the following procedures:

Donors: Stem cells are collected from the donor. To do this, the hormone granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the cells are collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the stem cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm.

Patients: For patients who do not already have a central venous catheter (plastic tube), one is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body the entire treatment period for giving medications, transfusing blood, , withdrawing blood samples, and delivering the donated stem cells. Before the transplant procedure, patients receive from one to three cycles of ""induction"" chemotherapy, with each cycle consisting of 5 days of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by at least a 17-day rest period. All the drugs are infused through the catheter except prednisone, which is taken by mouth. After the induction therapy, the patient is admitted to the hospital for 5 days of chemotherapy with high doses of cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and fludarabine. Two days later, the stem cells are infused. The anticipated hospital stay is about 3 weeks, but may be longer if complications arise. Patients are discharged when their white cell count is near normal, they have no fever or infection, they can take sufficient food and fluids by mouth, and they have no signs of serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-a condition in which the donor's cells ""see"" the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response against them.

After hospital discharge, patients are followed in the clinic at least once or twice weekly for a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for 100 days. They receive medications to prevent infection and GVHD and, if needed, blood transfusions. If GVHD has not developed by about 120 days post transplant, patients receive additional white cells to boost the immune response. After 100 days, follow-up visits may be less frequent. Follow-up continues for at least 5 years. During the course of the study, patients undergo repeated medical evaluations, including blood tests and radiology studies, to check on the cancer and on any treatment side effects. On four occasions, white blood cells may be collected through apheresis to see if immune responses can be generated against the sarcomas treated in this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be done on five occasions. This test uses a radioactive material to produce images useful in detecting primary tumors and cancer that has spread.","Background:

* Treatment of pediatric sarcomas has enjoyed progress in the past 25 years for patients with localized, chemosensitive disease and prognostic factors are now available to identify subsets of patients who have very dismal prognoses; patients with primary metastatic disease, especially those with bone and bone marrow metastases.
* Patients with primary chemoresistant disease and early recurrence also have very poor prognoses and lack suitable treatment options. For these patients, it is critical that alternative approaches to cytotoxic chemotherapy be identified.
* Basic laboratory studies have shown that Ewing's sarcoma is susceptible to immune mediated mechanisms of cytolysis in vitro. Interestingly, for Ewing's sarcoma this appears to be true for both chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines.
* Recent progress in the field of bone marrow transplantation has identified approaches that can reproducibly induce allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell engraftment in adults with hematologic malignancies. In some cases, this same approach has shown beneficial effects for patients with solid tumors as a result of the development of allogeneic, immune-mediated graft versus tumor effects.

Objectives:

* To determine if the transplantation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched, peripheral blood stem cells can result in full donor engraftment (greater than 95 percent by day 100) in patients with high risk-pediatric sarcomas.
* To identify and characterize the toxicities of HLA-matched peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in patients with high-risk pediatric sarcomas. In particular we will identify the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and the pace of immune reconstitution in this population.
* To determine if allogeneic graft-versus-tumor responses following allogeneic PBSCT can induce clinically significant anti-tumor effects as measured by radiographic evidence of antitumor responses following PBSCT in patients with measurable disease and improved clinical outcome compared to historical controls in this patient population with a universally poor outcome.

Eligibility:

* Patients, age of greater than 4 years at enrollment to less than 30 years at diagnosis and age less than 35 at enrollment, with ultra-high risk Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.
* Patients must have completed standard front-line therapy and salvage therapy.
* Patient must have the availability of a 5 or 6 antigen HLA-matched first-degree relative donor or a genotypically identical twin.
* Patients must have adequate cardiac, pulmonary, renal, liver, and marrow function.

Design:

-Donor will be prepared for peripheral blood stem cell harvest with Filgrastim mobilization, 10 microg/kg per day subcutaneous (SQ) for 5-7 days until they have stem cell collected by apheresis. The stem cells will then be cryopreserved.

Patients will receive 1 to 3 21 day cycles of Fludarabine-EPOCH induction chemotherapy. The preparative regimen will consist of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and melphalan followed by stem cell infusion. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of sirolimus and tacrolimus.",COMPLETED,,2002-09-19,2011-12-14,2009-05-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,60,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": """", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""therapeutic allogeneic lymphocytes"", ""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""description"": ""Lymphocyte cells are collected from a healthy donor by apheresis and infused into the patient with a central venous catheter."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""cyclophosphamide"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Induction - 750 mg/m\\^2 intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes x 1 dose.

OTHER,NCT01655979,Medium-term Bedrest Whey Protein (MEP),,"The human being has shown that he can live and work in the space environment, but due to the lack of essential mechanical load on muscle and bone, the fluid-shift as well as alterations in the acid-base balance (mainly on account of nutritional factors), the exposure to microgravity results in a gradual degradation of muscle, bone and cartilage, deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and metabolic changes. Countermeasures to prevent all the deconditioning of the physiological systems are not yet fully effective and require further investigation.

A commonly utilized model of simulating the physiological effects of microgravity on the human organism on ground is the 6° head-down-tilt bed rest. In the present study the model has been used to study potential countermeasures to spaceflight-associated deconditioning.

One of the most constrictive changes appearing during space flight as well as during bed rest, are disuse-induced muscle losses. These are associated with a decrease in muscle protein synthesis, rather then an increase in muscle protein breakdown. Besides an effective training countermeasure, nutritional countermeasures gain respect in this context: supplementing conventional diets with whey protein or essential amino acids has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis. Due to these anabolic properties whey protein seems promising to counteract disuse-induced muscle wasting.

Drawbacks of a high protein intake are calciuric effects, ascribed to the proton-release when metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids. The so called 'low grade metabolic acidosis' has also shown to activate osteoclastic bone resorption and muscle protein degradation. Therefore, to maximize the anabolic potential of a whey protein supplementation, the acidogenic properties need to be compensated. As previous works suggest, a shift of acid base balance into the acid direction and the resulting changes in bone and protein turnover may be hindered by supplementing alkaline mineral salts.

In this regard, a mid-term bed rest study was performed in order to investigate the effect of a combined whey protein (0.6 g/kg body weight/day) and potassium bicarbonate (90 mmol/day) supplementation as a potential countermeasure to multiple physiological and metabolic alterations on the human body resulting from real and simulated microgravity.",,COMPLETED,,2011-08,,2012-04,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,NONE,TREATMENT,10,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Whey Protein + Potassium bicarbonate"", ""type"": ""DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT"", ""description"": ""0.6 mmol WP/kg body weight + 90 mmol KHCO3 during bed rest"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Control"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Bed rest without dietary supplement"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT;OTHER,whey protein + potassium bicarbonate;control,1

Study design: A phase I study with a classical 3\*3 design. Study population: Adult patients with malignant mesothelioma who were treated with chemotherapy as standard treatment.

Intervention: After chemotherapy, a leukapheresis is performed of which the monocytes are used for differentiation to DCs using specific cytokines. Pulsed autologous DCs (MesoCancerVac) are re-injected 3 times every two weeks. After the third injection with MesoCancerVac, revaccinations to boost the immune system are given after 3 and 6 months.

A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial","CAD/CAM Fixed Retainers vs. Conventional Multistranded Fixed Retainers in Orthodontic Patients. Comparison of Stability, Retainer Failure Rate, Adverse Effects, Cost-effectiveness, and Patient Satisfaction. A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.","Introduction:

Orthodontic retainers are used after the completion of orthodontic treatment to assure dental occlusal stability and to maintain the achieved end-result. However, without retention teeth could go back to their initial dental malposition or could even take a different unpredicted position resulting once again in dental malocclusion (a deviation from normal occlusion).

There are different types of retainers, some are fixed (glued to the back of the front teeth), and others are removable (can be removed and replaced into the mouth by the patient).

While there are various retainers used for retention (stability), there is no perfect method. Fixed retainers (FRs) are used worldwide. On the one hand, FRs focus on preventing relapse. On the other hand, there are sometimes some adverse effects of retainers; they could fail at a certain point (break/get loose), or cause unwanted tooth movements. Until now, the choice of a retention method is based solely on clinicians' experience as there is no substantial evidence regarding the best retention method or the duration of the retention period. Some clinicians prolong the retention period while others prefer to keep the retainers for an indefinite time.

As the world is advancing, so is the orthodontic science. New FR fabricated by CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing), are assumed to have greater accuracy, better fit, and most importantly, might offer a passive positioning of the retainer. However, the evidence about CAD/CAM FRs is very limited.

Purpose:

To investigate and compare the clinical effectiveness of two types of FRs; CAD/CAM vs. multistranded wire, in terms of stability (primary outcome), failure rate, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and patient satisfaction (secondary outcomes), substantial up to 5 years after retainer placement.

Hypotheses:

Compared to traditional multistranded FRs, CAD/CAM FRs have:

* Better long term stability,
* Similar failure rate,
* Fewer adverse effects,
* Similar cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.","Material and Methods

Setting: Section of Orthodontics, Department of Dentistry and Oral Health, Aarhus University, Denmark and Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Norway.

Sample size: 126 participants are needed for this study.

Randomization: After oral and written consent is obtained, allocation to groups, either conventional multistranded Stainless Steel fixed retainers, or CAD/CAM custom-cut Nickel Titanium fixed retainers, will take place at the last appointment before debonding. Subjects will be allocated 1:1 into one of the two groups.

Intervention protocol: After completing a full active orthodontic treatment, at both centers. The achieved treatment end result has to be maintained in the long term in order to prevent relapse (movement of teeth to the initial malocclusion). One of either two different fixed retainers will be bonded (to the upper and lower anterior teeth) by one operator in each center.

This study follows a standard retention protocol procedure carried at both centers and has a long term posttreatment follow-up of 5 years. Patients will be recalled for follow-up appointments after 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 months. At follow-up visits, we will perform the following: at 1, and 3 months - a clinical examination. At 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months - a clinical examination, a digital impression of the teeth known as ""an intraoral scan"" (Trios 3, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) and intraoral photographs. In addition, at 1, 6, and 12 months patients will be asked to fill out a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) form regarding patient satisfaction Furthermore, we will investigate stability by superimposition (Orthoanalyzer, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) together with recording of adverse effects (i.e. any changes in torque and/or rotations of the teeth).",ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,,2018-09-01,2025-12,2025-11,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,OTHER,126,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Bonding of either CAD/CAM or conventional multistranded stainless steel fixed retainer"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Investigate and compare the clinical effectiveness of two types of fixed retainers; CAD/CAM vs. multistranded wire."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER,bonding of either cad/cam or conventional multistranded stainless steel fixed retainer,0

Some people have allergic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Researchers want to learn more about these reactions to provide guidance on who can safely receive the vaccines, including a second dose in people who had a reaction to the first.

Objective:

To study the safety of giving a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose to people who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose.

Eligibility:

People aged 16-69 who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

Design:

Individuals who have underlying health issues may need to come to the NIH for screening tests to make sure they are safe to receive the vaccine. People who are eligible to participate in the study will be admitted to the NIH hospital and stay for at least 4 days. They will give urine samples. They will have a nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 test. They will have an intravenous line placed in each arm. They will get the study vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) and one dose of placebo on different days. They will have breathing tests. They may have clinical photography if they develop a rash.

Participants will have 4 follow-up visits - 2 by phone and 2 in-person visits at the NIH campus . They will have allergy skin testing at one visit. Drops of different allergens or controls will be placed on their back or arm. The skin under each drop will be scratched with a tool. If the results are negative, a small amount of allergen will be injected just below the surface of their skin.

What is still not known is how to help sedentary people follow this recommendation, by means of brief interventions feasible in routine general practice. This multi-center study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a physical activity promotion program (called PEPAF) implemented in 56 general practices of the Spanish public primary health care system. The study will test the capacity of the program to increase the physical activity level, physical fitness and health related quality of life of sedentary people.","Despite sedentary behavior being one of the strongest risk factors for chronic diseases and mortality, most of the population remains sedentary and evidence is inconclusive that counseling adults in the primary care setting to increase physical activity is effective.

The OBJECTIVE of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative programme to promote physical activity (called PEPAF) implemented by family doctors into daily routine practice. Doctors randomly allocated to the PEPAF group identified sedentary people who visited them for any reason, diagnosed their stage of change and prescribed a written plan of physical activity with those patients ready to change. Those not prepared to change were briefly counseled and given printed materials to motivate them. Patients with cardiovascular disease or other problems meaning that exercise could cause adverse effects were excluded.

The Schroth method, one of the PSSE methods, has been shown to reduce the severity of the curvature, Cobb angles and the need for surgery, especially in curvatures between 10-30 degrees, slow down the progression of the curvature, increase back muscle strength and improve respiratory functions \[10-12\]. In the Schroth method, mental imagery, exteroceptive, proprioceptive stimulations and mirror control, which follow motor learning principles and include internal focus, are used to increase body awareness and facilitate the individual's self-posture corrections with postural, sensorimotor and rotational breathing exercises specific to scoliosis \[5, 10\]. In cases that require long-term treatment, such as scoliosis, the motivation and participation of the child and adolescent population in particular decreases and negatively affects the success of treatment \[1, 2\]. Additionally, it has been reported in the literature that patients have difficulty in performing Schroth exercises at home and adapting the corrected posture to daily life\[5\]. For this reason, in order to maintain the corrected posture and make it permanent, motor learning-based approaches must be used \[6\]. Virtual reality rehabilitation (VR) creates an external focus on the individual, allows for a large number of repetitions, and thus encourages motor learning. It is also known that VR increases motivation, participation and exercise performance in children and adolescents\[7\]. When the literature was examined, no studies were found regarding VR in individuals with AIS.

The study will show that Schroth-based VR will be effective on spinal parameters, trunk rotation and spinal mobility parameters in cases with AIS. Our aim is to examine the effects of Schroth-based VR in comparison with Schroth exercises in cases with AIS.","Schroth method, applied in the conservative treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), uses internally focused feedback to increase body awareness and maintain corrected posture. However, it has been reported in the literature that patients have difficulty in performing exercises at home and adapting the corrected posture to daily life\[5\]. In addition, since scoliosis rehabilitation requires long-term follow-up, patients' participation in treatment, motivation and exercise performance decrease over time \[1, 2\].

The online questionnaire survey was conducted by stratified and network sampling methods. A total of 17,164 questionnaires were collected, which included demographic characteristics of nurses; knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors related to needle injury protection of nurses; hospital management, training, and assessment of ""needle injury"" protocols. Additionally, the knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors of nurses in needle stick injuries were compared according to the economic region, and the correlation between influencing factors was analyzed.","Background: Needle stick injuries are a leading cause of occupational exposure in clinical nurse practice, with previous studies establishing that their incidence is typically lower in developed countries and affected by the local economic level. In China, significant differences in economic development levels exist between different regions. Based on the division of the economic region, this study investigated and analyzed differences in the incidence of needle stick injuries and the influencing factors among clinical nurses in different economic regions.

Methods:

The survey considered the level of economic development and regional characteristics. It included at least 5 tertiary hospitals from each provincial administrative unit, encompassing general hospitals, specialized hospitals, maternal and child health care hospitals, etc. Inclusion criteria for nurses: in-service and on-the-job clinical nurses working in tertiary hospitals holding valid nurse qualification certificates who voluntarily cooperated with the investigators. Exclusion criteria: nursing students, nursing managers, individuals taking maternity leave due to pregnancy or childbirth, refusal to participate in the survey, questionnaire completion time not meeting the minimum requirement, reverse entry selections, and incomplete responses. All study subjects were informed of the survey details in advance and signed the informed consent form before accessing the survey page.

Questionnaire This survey included a custom-made questionnaire entitled ""Survey on the status of needle prick injuries in clinical nurses"". It was designed by the researcher in collaboration with the experts of the clinical IV therapy team of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University based on the ""NSI protection expert consensus in 2018"" \[23\] and was completed through four rounds of discussion and revisions. The expert group consisted of 13 members (including one statistical expert) distributed across five cities, seven general hospitals, and one medical college (statistical expert), among which 10 held senior titles and three held deputy senior titles. The questionnaire was reviewed by via four rounds of expert consultations from seven hospitals. Considering the influence of regional cultural differences in written expression, 268 pilot questionnaires were initially conducted in Chongqing (Western region), Guangdong (Southern region), and Hebei (Northern region) to further refine language and content. Finally, the questionnaire comprised three sections: 1. demographic characteristics of nurses, including region, hospital name, department name, age, years of experience, nursing role, nurse title, educational level, etc.; 2. Knowledge, belief, and behavior of nurses regarding NSI protection; 3. Hospital management, training, and assessment of the implementation of ""NSI protection"". The Kronbuck coefficient of the knowledge, belief, and behavior questionnaire was 0.789.

Based on the population data of each provincial administrative unit in 2021 \[24\], a stratified sampling method was employed based on a ratio of 1/100,000 population for each unit. The online questionnaire survey was distributed through an online survey software (Questionnaire Star) combined with an online sampling method. China Nursing Association is the only national nursing association organization for Nurses in China, with the Hospital Infection Management Committee of the Chinese Nursing Society being a subdivision of the organization. Its members are distributed in 28 provincial administrative units across the country, with over 800 members and 130 nursing department directors. This survey was officially published by the Hospital Infection Management Committee of the Chinese Nursing Society. Following approval of the survey notification information and questionnaire by the committee, the committee informed the liaison officers of the national hospital infection management committee to inform the head nurses of the hospital through the official WeChat working group, who in turn shared the questionnaire in the WeChat working groups of the department nurses. The notice asked the head nurse to emphasize the principle of voluntariness to the investigation object when sharing the questionnaire.

After the completion of the round of the survey, the researchers compiled completed statistics for each province and contacted liaison officers of local hospitals for the provinces that failed to meet the standards to launch a new round of data collection in the hospital. The survey was conducted from 8:00 on November 9, 2022, to 20:00 on February 16, 2023. Each round of surveys lasted 1 week.

Quality control When transcribing the questionnaire into an electronic format, two persons were accountable for logical consistency. To exclude invalid responses, a screening page was set, option quotas were established, the time for responses was controlled, and the answer input areas were restricted. Additionally, restrictions were imposed to allow login exclusively via WeChat, with each IP address and physical address limited to a single submission.

Data collection In order to ensure the integrity and reliability of the questionnaire, an informed consent page and explanation page were set up to detail the purpose and significance of the survey, as well as participant requirements, instructions, etc. The respondent could proceed with the questionnaire by selecting ""agree to conduct the survey"". The features of the questionnaire were as follows: 1. Set the questionnaire topic as the required topic; 2. requiring complete responses, with incomplete submissions being automatically rejected; 3. Setting the minimum time of completion to 5'20"" according to the pre-survey, with submissions below this threshold automatically classified as invalid. A total of 17,164 questionnaires were collected, including 15,274 valid questionnaires, yielding an effective response rate of 89.89%.

Statistical method Categorical data were described as frequencies and rates, and group comparisons were performed using the chi-square test, with p-values adjusted using the S method for post-hoc pairwise comparisons. Measurement data following a normal distribution were presented mean ± standard deviation and compared using the two independent samples t-test or ANOVA, and post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using the SNK-q test. Variables with P \<0.05 in the univariate analysis were incorporated in a multivariate linear regression model to identify factors influencing the total score of the respondents and were screened using the stepwise selection method.

Variables with P \<0.05 in the univariate analysis were incorporated in a multivariate linear regression model to identify factors influencing the total score of the respondents and were screened using the stepwise selection method with inclusion criteria for P \<0.05 and exclusion for P ≥0.05.

The multiple mediation effect model was utilized to elucidate the association between economic regions and needle stick injury and to quantify the indirect and direct associations between economic regions through needle stick injury-related management, assessment, and training as mediating variables. In the present study, considering that multiple mediating variables were dichotomous variables, the indirect effects were challenging to directly measure. Therefore, the indirect effect size was quantified by the percentage of mediation (percentage mediated, PM), formula 1 minus the ratio of the direct effect (Direct effect, DE) to the total effect (Total effect, TE) multiplied by 100%: PM= (1-DE/TE) x 100%. This calculation was implemented using a partial macro program.

Patients with stage III and IV NSCLC are at risk of having their cancer spread from where it first started to the brain (metastatic). Because of this, more effective prognostic tools are necessary to determine which stage III and IV NSCLC patients are more likely to develop brain metastases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could be a reliable source of ctDNA to confirm and predict the presence of brain metastases in these patients. Assessing cell free DNA shed from tumor cells could be a sensitive and minimally invasive way to detect or characterize metastatic tumors in the central nervous system (CNS). Lumbar puncture is procedure in which a thin needle called a spinal needle is put into the lower part of the spinal column to collect CSF. Lumbar punctures for the collection of CSF may help doctors detect or measure changes in cell types, genes, and proteins of circulating tumor cells related to lung cancer that will help determine the presence of brain metastases which could become a standard of care screening tool utilized in the follow-up of patients diagnosed with stage II or IV NSCLC.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if CSF-ctDNA positivity in patients with locally advanced lung cancer can predict the presence of brain metastases within a one year period.

NIH,NCT00059579,Brain Regulation of Emotions in People With Depression and Anhedonia,Functional MRI Study of Brain Mechanism Mediating Anhedonia in Major Depression,"This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine how the brain regulates emotions in healthy people and in patients who have major depression and anhedonia (loss of feeling of pleasure in things that normally give pleasure).

Healthy normal volunteers and patients between 18 and 50 years of age with major depression, with or without significant anhedonia, are eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a psychiatric interview, a physical examination that will include blood and urine samples, and an electrocardiogram, and a questionnaire about their emotions.

Participants will perform a monetary reward task while lying in an MRI scanner. The task is similar to playing a computer video game with the possibility of winning cash. The amount of cash is largely dependent on the subject's performance. The accumulated amount of cash earned in a session will fluctuate depending on the subject's continuing performance level. That is, during a single session, a subject could lose money earned early in the session if his or her performance later in the session is not as good as earlier.

MRI pictures will be taken during performance of the task. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder) and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure will last about 1 to 1-1/2 hours.","Anhedonia has been one of the two key diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) since the publication of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, yet little is known about its neural substrates. Neuroimaging studies have identified numerous brain regions that are thought to be involved with MDD. Most studies dealt with MDD as a syndromal entity, and not surprisingly, yielded quite variable results with respect to the areas of the brain identified, the nature of the functional changes (i.e., decrease or increase in activities), lateralization, and correlation with clinical symptoms. Clinical heterogeneity and lack of symptom-specific targets are presumably among the factors contributing to the variability. The hypothesis that a functionally impaired mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway may comprise a part of neural substrate underlying core MDD symptoms of anhedonia and loss of motivation has been proposed. Nevertheless, the roles of brain reward mechanisms in mediating anhedonia in MDD remain unclear. Availability of appropriate experimental paradigms that can be used empirically to measure anhedonia is a prerequisite to test such a hypothesis. Recent studies using monetary incentive paradigms coupled with neuroimaging techniques have identified hemodynamic responses in structures that serve as part of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway during processing rewards in healthy humans.

We hypothesize that anhedonia in MDD is associated with impairment of brain reward mechanisms such that dysfunction of the orbital and ventromedial frontal cortices involved in the impaired hedonic attribution capacity, while dysfunction of the ventral striatum area that contains the nucleus accumbens is involved with the reduced or lack of reactivity to rewarding environmental stimuli in patients with MDD. Our hypothesis is to link specific neural substrates to the two psychiatric components of anhedonia, i.e., loss of interest and lack of reactivity, as defined in the diagnostic criteria for MDD. We plan to operationally test our hypothesis by using empirical measurement of reward responses in MDD patients with and without significant anhedonia using a conditioning task assessing appetitive and aversive learning without any performance aspects and spatial delayed response task assessing the relationship between reward, performance and mood with the event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging method. We expect to find reduced activation of the ventral striatum, orbital and ventromedial frontal cortices in response to monetary incentive stimuli in MDD patients with significant anhedonia relative to MDD patients without anhedonia and healthy control.

In order to assess the role of dopamine in anhedonia and in reward processing, we propose to assess the effect of dietary tyrosine plus phenylalanine depletion on the neural and behavioral responses associated with the performing of the monetary reward tasks investigated herein in an additional sample of subjects. Dietary depletion of tyrosine and phenylalanine, two DA precursors, is a validated method to induce significant reduction of the brain DA concentration as shown in two previous \[11C\]Raclopride PET studies. We hypothesize that depressed patients will show less activation than controls in brain regions associated with the mesolimbic DA system, such as striatum, amygdala, anterior cingulate gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex in response to reward in the placebo condition. We expect tyrosine and phenylalanine depletion to induce a similar neural impairment to reward in healthy subjects, including a reduction of the neural activation in the striatum, amygdala, anterior cingulate gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex in response to reward. The reduction of the neural activation in those regions will be stronger in healthy controls than in depressed patients. Finally, we hypothesize that tyrosine depletion will influence negatively the valence ratings of rewarding stimuli in healthy subjects. In depressed patients, anhedonia scores will correlate negatively with the valence ratings of rewarding stimuli in the placebo condition already.

The outcome of the proposed work may provide clues for diagnosis, classification, and treatment of MDD, and may also yield leads for identifying the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying anhedonia in other disabling psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and addiction.",COMPLETED,,2003-04-24,2010-11-12,,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,163,ACTUAL,[],,,1

OTHER,NCT02428179,Impact of Structured Communication in the OR on Surgical Site Infections: Prospective Observational Clinical Trial,StOP?-Trial: Impact of Structured Communication in the OR on Surgical Site Infections: Prospective Observational Clinical Trial,"Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most frequent complication in patients that undergo abdominal surgery. A previous prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing elective open abdominal procedures showed that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI whereas case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for incisional SSI. Therefore, the introduction of a clinical applicable intervention ""structured briefing using the StOP protocol"" has been developed and was tested in pilot experiments. This intervention aims at improving case-relevant communication during the procedure and to reduce excess case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation.

The hypothesis is: structured briefings during an operation reduce the incidence of SSI after surgery.","Background

A number of publications has shown a relatively high rate of complications that are related to the treatment and not to the disease. Such iatrogenic incidents are an important influence on patient morbidity and increase healthcare costs. Therefore, patient safety and minimizing the risk of iatrogenic harm has become a major concern in healthcare. Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most frequent complication in patients that undergo surgery, leading to considerable costs.

In a previous study, the investigators established an empirical relationship between communication during surgery and SSI was shown in a prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing major elective open abdominal procedures. An analysis of 11383 communication events observed by a team of trained work psychologists showed a relationship between intraoperative communication and SSI. Adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that more case-relevant communication during the entire procedure was associated with a significant reduction in organ/space SSI (odds ratio 0.861, 95% confidence interval 0.750-0.987; P=0.034). Interestingly, case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure was associated with a significant increase of incisional SSI (odds ratio 1.1153, 95% confidence interval 1.040-1.196; P=0.002). Distractors such as noise and traffic were also assessed but had no effect on SSI. The current study is based on these observations, which reveal that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI and case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for SSI.

These findings can be interpreted in light of previous studies assessing communication in surgery and similar collaborative tasks which showed that explicit task-relevant communication fosters the development of a shared mental model of the task within the team. This facilitates coordination, because all team members are informed about the state of task progress, and can better anticipate their contribution. This is particularly important in critical phases of the procedure, as well as in OR teams composed of members with different levels of knowledge and expertise. Explicit task-related communication may be particularly useful to inform non-sterile team members (anesthetists, scrub nurses) that do not have full sight of the operative field at all times.

Although case-irrelevant communication in surgical teams has been found to foster a positive team-climate, it can be seen as a distractor if it diverts the attention away from the main task. This is more likely during the closing phase (last 20 minutes), because for most of the team members, the central task is already finished, and clearing and cleaning are routine tasks. If during routine tasks the team engages in too much non-patient relevant communication, attention to the closure may be diverted.

Given the previously found results, the introduction of a clinically applicable intervention (described below) has been tested in pilot studies. This intervention aims to assure a short discussion of case-relevant aspects at specific moments of the procedure, draw the attention of the on case-relevant communication during the main phase and to prevent a high increase in case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation.

Objective

To perform a prospective clinical trial to test the impact of structured intraoperative briefings on SSI. The incidence of SSIs will be compared before and after the introduction of this intervention.

Methods

- Intraoperative briefings: First briefing: after exposure of the organ of interest, Second briefing: Intraoperative briefing before closure of the operative field.

The investigators hypothesize that infants who receive primarily their own mother's milk will have better growth, a more diverse intestinal bacterial environment, and possibly some improved short term outcomes such as better feeding tolerance and lower rates of infection.","Background: Human milk feeding provides numerous benefits to preterm infants due to improvements in gastrointestinal maturation, host defense, infection rates, and improved long-term outcomes in neurodevelopment as well as cardiovascular and metabolic disease. There is accumulating evidence that an exclusive human milk-based diet decreases the rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and death, and is associated with better feeding tolerance in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants than a diet of bovine milk-based products. In order to provide VLBW infants the benefits afforded by human milk feeding, the use of donor milk (DM) in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) has increased as many mothers are unable to provide sufficient milk needed for their premature infants. While there have been numerous studies that have favorably compared feeding of mother's own milk (MOM) to formula as well as studies that compare DM to formula, there are relatively few that compare maternal milk to donor milk.

In regard to feeding tolerance and infection prevention, it has been proposed that DM may be less beneficial than MOM due to reduction in biologically active components during pasteurization, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and other immunological factors, growth factors, and hormones. Finally, alterations in the intestinal microbiota of preterm infants are suspected to contribute to disease states such as NEC, specifically within infants who have decreased microbial diversity. To the investigators knowledge, no studies comparing the intestinal microbiota among infants fed primarily MOM versus those fed primarily DM have been published.

Purpose: To compare growth velocities, time to reach full enteral feeding volume, intestinal microbiota, and short term outcomes (NEC, late-onset sepsis, white matter injury) between infants fed primarily mother's own milk versus pasteurized donor human milk.

Hypothesis: Infants fed primarily (50% or greater) mother's own milk will have increased intestinal microbiome diversity compared to infants fed primarily pasteurized donor human milk.

Design: This prospective cohort study will be conducted in the Level III NICU at Texas Children's Hospital - Pavilion for Women and the Level II NICU at Texas Children's Hospital -- West Tower. Infants less than 1500 g birth weight will be fed exclusively human milk (mother's milk and or donor breast milk) fortified with donor human milk-derived fortifier per the investigators hospital guidelines. Once enteral feeding is established, infants will be categorized into cohorts based on percentage of feeding volume consisting of mother's own milk, including broad categorization of greater than 50% maternal milk versus less than 50%, and possibly tiered analysis of infants who receive less 25% maternal milk, 25-75% maternal milk, and greater than 75% maternal milk.

An enrollment goal of greater than 125 infants including twins and multiples will be targeted for adequate sample size.

Procedure: Infants will be enrolled within 72 hours of birth and started on parenteral nutrition and enteral human milk feedings per standardized feeding protocols and discretion of the attending neonatologist on service. Decisions to decrease or discontinue enteral feedings due to medical instability will be made by the attending neonatologist. Infants will be preferentially fed their own mothers' milk when available. For mothers who are unable to express adequate milk volume for their infants, pooled, pasteurized donor human milk will be offered per established NICU protocol. Feeds will be supplemented with human-milk based fortifier per protocol.

At time of initial consent for the study, mothers will also be asked for consent to obtain a small sample (0.2-0.5 mL) of colostrum or expressed milk produced in the first week of life, as well as weekly milk samples thereafter, in order to analyze bacterial content of milk as it compares to the developing infant microbiome. However, consent for milk collection is not required for the infant's participation in the study. For infants who receive primarily donor milk, weekly samples of the milk they receive may similarly be analyzed for bacterial content.

Infant stool samples will be collected during the first week of life and then at weekly intervals for six weeks for research purposes. The samples will be analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing to determine diversity of intestinal microbiota. Additional analysis for metabolomics will be considered if lab availability and cost allows.

Once weekly, a research nurse or physician will document growth measurements, including weight, length, and head circumference. Outcome data from the infants' medical records will be recorded, including time to regain birth weight, feeding tolerance as indicated by time required to reach full enteral feeding volumes of 100 ml/kg/day (for hydration) and 130-160 ml/kg/day (final goal volume for nutrition), and rates of NEC, spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), late-onset sepsis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). As all preterm infants less than 1000 g birth weight born at TCH-PFW have routinely performed brain MRIs at term gestation or hospital discharge, enrolled infants who fall into this subgroup will have their MRI results reviewed for outcome analysis.

Additional medical record data for collection will include mechanism of delivery (cesarean vs. vaginal), antibiotics received by mother during 2nd and 3rd trimester as well as at time of delivery and while nursing/expressing milk, antibiotics received by baby during hospitalization, length of hospitalization, postmenstrual age at discharge, days NPO, days of parenteral nutrition, percentage of patients with patent ductus arteriosus, and rates of intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, and death.

Although there is no long-term follow up currently designed for this study, at time of initial enrollment there will be an optional consent to allow study personnel to access medical records for patients who go on to have neurodevelopmental follow up visits at clinics within the investigators institution. There will also be optional consent for families to be contacted when the infant is approximately 6, 12, 18, and 24 months for developmental follow up. This will allow for possible comparison of neurodevelopmental outcomes at approximately 18-24 months in the subgroup of patients whose mothers consent to these aspects of the study.

The purpose of this study was to compare utilization of digital versus face-to-face delivered osteoarthritis (OA) treatment in the 21 different county councils of Sweden that are responsible for providing healthcare to the residents.","Since 2008 Sweden has had a structured first-line face-to-face knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) treatment program, Better management of patients with OsteoArthritis (BOA). However, records show that this face-to-face program is underutilized and reaches only a minority of those that would benefit from it.

The first-line OA management program has been transformed into a digital version, Joint Academy® (JA), to facilitate implementation, scaling, increased accessibility, and improved patient adherence. The mobile application (app) consists of video instructions distributed daily with individualized exercises for participants with knee or hip OA, as well as educational information on OA symptoms and self-management based on current international guidelines for the management of OA. Each participant is assigned to a physical therapist available through asynchronous chat and telephone who supervises the participant throughout the whole program.

To improve chronically ill patients' health and quality of life, long-standing and continuous treatment is needed at an acceptable cost. Recent evidence suggests that JA costs 25% compared to the BOA program for three months of treatment. Providing patients with equal access to care necessitates availability in urban and rural areas alike. This can potentially be achieved by digital delivery, but it is yet unknown if digital delivery of first-line OA treatment, compared with face-to-face, improves equal access to care.

NIH,NCT00000579,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Clinical Network (ARDSNet),Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Clinical Network (ARDSNet),"The purposes of this study are to assess rapidly innovative treatment methods in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as those at risk of developing ARDS and to create a network of interactive Critical Care Treatment Groups (CCTGs) to establish and maintain the required infrastructure to perform multiple therapeutic trials that may involve investigational drugs, approved agents not currently used for treatment of ARDS, or treatments currently used but whose efficacy has not been well documented.","BACKGROUND:

ARDS affects approximately 150,000 people in the United States each year. Despite 20 years of research into the mechanisms that cause this syndrome and numerous developments in the technology of mechanical ventilation, the mortality has remained greater than 50 percent. Many of the patients are young, and to the tragic loss of human life can be added the cost to society because these patients spend an average of 2 weeks in intensive care units and require multiple high tech procedures. Because of the overwhelming nature of the lung injury once it is established, prevention would appear to be the most effective strategy for improving the outlook in this condition.

Basic research has identified numerous inflammatory pathways that are associated with the development of ARDS. Agents that block these mediators prolong survival in animals with lung injury, and a few of them have been tested in patients. Because of the large number of putative mediators and the variety of ways that their action can be blocked, the possibility for new drug development is almost infinite. This is an exciting prospect, since it envisions the first effective pharmacologic treatment for ARDS. However, preliminary clinical studies have shown conflicting results, and there is an urgent need for a mechanism to efficiently and effectively test new drugs in ARDS.

Treatment studies in patients with ARDS are difficult to perform for three reasons. The complicated clinical picture makes it difficult to accumulate a large number of comparable patients in any one center. There is no agreement on the optimal supportive care of these critically ill patients. Many of the patients meeting study criteria will not be enrolled in study protocols because of the acute nature of the disease process. For these reasons, therapeutic trials in ARDS require multicenter cooperation.

The concept for the initiative was first discussed at a meeting of the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome Foundation and staff of the Division of Lung Diseases. The results of a working meeting on uniform definitions in ARDS held at the 1992 meeting of the American Thoracic Society reinforced the recommendation from the community for National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute participation in drug evaluation in ARDS. The concept for the initiative was approved by the September 1992 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Requests for Proposals were released in October 1993.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

It is anticipated that over the 12-year period, several multicenter clinical trials will be developed and implemented. A 12-month Phase I period was devoted to planning and developing the infrastructure and committee structure and to protocol development and prioritization. In Phase IIa, staff are trained in data acquisition procedures and patients are enrolled. Additional protocol development may begin for subsequent studies. In Phase IIb, after the last patients in the first study have completed their follow-up measurements, data will be reviewed and the initial study will be closed out. Protocol development continues for subsequent trials. In Phase III, final data analysis and publication preparation will occur.

Enrollment of 1,000 patients into the first ARDSNet protocol, ""Ketoconazole and Respiratory Management in Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"" (KARMA) began in the spring of 1996. KARMA assessed the efficacy of 6 ml/kg versus 12 ml/kg positive pressure ventilation in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS. It also assessed the efficacy of ketoconazole, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS. The ketoconazole arm was stopped by the Data Monitoring Safety Board (DSMB) in January 1997 after the enrollment of 234 patients. Ketoconazole did not show any benefit in survival, duration of ventilation, or any measure of lung function. The ventilator arm of the protocol continued until March 10, 1999, and compared the efficacy of high (12 ml/kg) and low (6 ml/kg) tidal volume ventilation in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS. The ventilator portion of the trial was stopped on March 10, 1999, on the recommendation of the DSMB when the data from the first 861 patients showed approximately 25 percent fewer deaths among patients receiving small, rather than large, breaths of air from the mechanical ventilator.

A new drug, lisofylline, was selected to replace ketoconazole in the factorial design ventilation protocol. The lisofylline study (LARMA) began in February 1998. The study tested the efficacy of lisofylline, an analog of pentoxifylline, that has been shown to protect against tissue injury mediated by oxidants and to suppress production of a number of cytokine mediators that amplify the inflammatory process. Patients were randomized to either the high or low tidal volume ventilation treatment group and between lisofylline and placebo. The aim of the lisofylline protocol was to determine whether the administration of lisofylline early after the onset of acute lung injury or ARDS would reduce morbidity or mortality. The study was cosponsored by Cell Therapeutics Incorporated. The trial was stopped by the DSMB on May 27, 1999, after results were obtained on 221 patients. There was no effect on mortality, time on ventilation, or organ failure.

The ""Late Steroid Rescue Study (LaSRS): The Efficacy of Corticosteroids as Rescue Therapy for the Late Phase of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"" (LaSRS is pronounced ""Lazarus"") compared the effect of corticosteroids with placebo in the management of late-phase (greater than 7 days) ARDS. The study determined if the administration of the corticosteroid, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, in severe ARDS that was either stable or worsening after 7 days, would reduce mortality and morbidity. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. Secondary endpoints included ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. LaSRS was designed to include 400 patients and began recruiting in the spring of 1997. In October 1999, the DSMB reduced the recruitment target number to 200 patients because the eligible patients were fewer than anticipated.

In November 1999, the Network began a new trial as a follow-on to the ventilator trial that has been named the ""Assessment of Low Tidal Volume and Elevated End-Expiratory Pressure to Obviate Lung Injury"" (ALVEOLI). This trial was a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial that included 549 patients and compared two groups of patients. Patients were randomized to receive mechanical ventilation with either lower or higher PEEP, which were set according to different tables of predetermined combinations of PEEP and fraction of inspired oxygen. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. Secondary endpoints included ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. The trial has ended and results were published in the July 22, 2004, issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The results suggest that in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS who receive mechanical ventilation with a tidal-volume goal of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an end-inspiratory plateau-pressure limit of 30 centimeters of water, clinical outcomes are similar whether lower or higher PEEP levels are used.

Network investigators have developed a plan for a new protocol to assess the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) as a management tool in ARDS. The new study was prompted by recommendations from the FDA/NIH Pulmonary Artery Catheter Clinical Outcomes workshop convened in August 1997 in response to concerns in the medical community regarding the clinical benefit and safety of PACs. The new protocol in the Fluids and Catheters Treatment Trial (FACTT) is a two-by-two factorial design comparing the patients receiving PAC or a central venous catheter (CVC) with one of two fluid management strategies (conservative versus liberal). The randomized, multicenter trial is designed to include 1,000 patients. The primary end point is mortality at 60 days. Secondary endpoints include ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. See NCT00281268 for more information on this study.

Albuterol versus Placebo in Acute Lung Injury (ALTA) Study: The Phase II/III study will test the safety and efficacy of aerosolized beta-2 adrenergic agonist therapy (albuterol sulfate) for reducing mortality in patients with acute lung injury. In Phase II, the safety of albuterol at the 5-mg dose will be compared to saline in approximately 100 patients. The dose will be reduced to 2.5 mg if patients exceed defined heart rate limits. Consequently, a Phase III placebo-controlled double-blinded, randomized trial on approximately 1,000 patients will compare 60-day mortality and ventilator-free days to Day 28 between the safe albuterol dose established in Phase II and placebo saline.

New efforts have been initiated to increase sample collection and utilize collected patient materials to investigate mechanisms of ARDS pathogenesis.

OTHER,NCT02354079,HYPOCHOL : A Genetically-based Strategy to Identify New Targets in Cholesterol Metabolism,HYPOCHOL : A Genetically-based Strategy to Identify New Targets in Cholesterol Metabolism,The aim of this study is to identify new targets in cholesterol metabolism thanks to a genetically-based strategy.,"The goal is to recruit 400 subjects: 200 adult subjects with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) (index cases) plus 200 additional related subjects in at least 10 large informative FHBL families, in which there is no known mutation in FHBL genes.

The patient care is modified: patient will have an Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire (focus on depressive syndrome), a food diary, and some additional blood analysis (including genetic analysis).

One of the main issue to recruit FHBL patients is the fact that they are asymptomatic and that FHBL is not identified as a serious illness by their general physicians.

Step-1. Excluding mutations in selected candidate genes As a first approach to screen candidate genes and exclude patients with known mutations, the investigators developed a custom design based on the Haloplex™ technology (Agilent® Technologies) to perform high-throughput sequencing of the coding regions of 10 genes, including those previously described in FHBL (apolipoprotein B (APOB), Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)), Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP or ABL), chylomicron retention disease (CMRD), Secretion associated, Ras related GTPase (SARA2 gene), as well as 6 additional candidate genes in cholesterol metabolism (low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), Sortilin (SORT1), Inducible Degrader of the LDL receptor (IDOL), Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and Angiopoietin-like Protein 3 (ANGTPL3)). All the recruited index cases (n=200) will be genotyped to select only those without mutations in previously described genes, being approximately 50% of our index case cohort.

Step-2. Identification of informative families and exome sequencing In patients without identified mutations, the investigators will conduct a familial screening in order to identify other cases of FHBL among proband relatives. An analysis of fasting plasma lipid parameters (total cholesterol (TC), High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)) will be performed for each related. Affected subjects will be determined by a spontaneous LDL-C \< 80 mg/dl and/or apoB \< 50 mg/dl. In contrast, non-affected subjects will display LDL-C \> 80 mg/dl and/or apoB \> 50 mg/dl.

For large families, the investigators will then combine whole-exome sequencing and linkage analysis to identify any novel genetic variant likely explaining FHBL. Depending on family pedigree, whole-exome sequencing (WES) will be performed on 2 to 5 patients per family. All relatives will be genotyped for linkage analysis.

In parallel to this genetic approach, a regional epidemiological analysis will be performed to identify some geographical clusters with a high prevalence of the disease, as developed in the project named VaCaRMe (for Vascular and Cardiac, Respiratory and Metabolic overcome diseases)

Scientific Background One of the main problems associated with composite resin restorations is poor adaptation and gap formation between the restorative material and the cavity walls, resulting in the micro-leakage of oral fluids and accumulation of fluids responsible for many problems such as postoperative hypersensitivity, marginal discoloration and recurrent caries.

   Despite of recent developments in dental restorative materials and techniques, postoperative sensitivity following the application of a posterior resin composite restoration is often reported by dentists, as a clinical problem.

   Pre-application warming of dental resin composite restorative materials, is considered one of the modern modifications for the application of resin composite, which reduces viscosity and increases flowability, that in turn secures superior adaptation to the prepared cavity walls.

   Resin composite warming appliances found in the market nowadays, offer multiple choices for preheating either in different temperatures or in the form of the cassettes which could be compatible with different supplied forms from different manufacturers ""capsules or syringes"". Multiple cycles of preheating for the used composite resin syringe can affect both marginal integrity and mechanical properties of the resin composite according to the number of cycles applied.

   Increasing the temperature of dental resin composite before application can aid in monomer mobility inside its matrix giving high quality of degree of conversion and more highly cross-linked polymeric network. This kind of change of the rheology of the resin composite can aid in decreasing the postoperative hyper-sensitivity.

   However, an intensive review of literature failed to disclose the effect of using resin composite preheated for multiple times with different temperatures on the post-operative hypersensitivity.
2. Statement of the problem Using the same resin composite syringe that previously preheated multiple times in different daily restorative cases, can adversely affect the properties and the performance of the applied resin composite.
3. Hypothesis The null hypothesis is that using resin composite previously preheated for different cycles will not be different in reducing postoperative hypersensitivity, marginal integrity and mechanical properties of the resin composite as without preheating.

D. The sample size calculation

1. primary outcome: This power analysis used marginal integrity after 12 months as the primary outcome. Based upon the results of Kurdi R and Abboud SA (2016); Bulk Fill composite showed 13 cases with (Alpha) score and 4 cases with (Beta) score, respectively. The effect size (w) was 0.53.

Sample size was increased to 35 cases to compensate for a drop-out rate of 25% after 12 months. Sample size calculation was performed using G\*Power Version 3.1.9.2.
2. secondary outcome: This power analysis used hypersensitivity grades after one day in patient with medium cavity depth as the primary outcome. The effect sizes w1 = (1.4) and w2 = (1.11) were calculated based upon the results of Ragab H (2018). Using alpha (α) level of (5%) and Beta (β) level of (20%) i.e. power = 80%; the minimum estimated sample size was a total of 11 subjects.

The features evaluated included an enhanced Automatic Gain Control (eAGC), the option to provide acoustic amplification in combination with traditional electric stimulation through an acoustic component, and three input processing algorithms: Signal to Noise Ratio - Noise Canceller (SNR-NC), Wind Noise Reduction (WNR) and Automatic Scene Analyzer (SCAN).

As is customary for a single-subject research design, study results will be analyzed for each subject individually. For evaluations where testing took place under two conditions (i.e. Endpoint 2, 3, 4, and 5) a non-inferiority hypothesis test based on the paired comparisons of the % of words correct will be performed. For each subject, the paired difference (P1 minus P2) will be calculated and the mean difference will be tested statistically against a non-inferiority null hypothesis of 10%. Successful rejection of the null hypothesis allows for a conclusion that the performance under the test condition 2 (based on the Nucleus 6 sound processor) will be non-inferior to the test condition 1 (based on the Nucleus 5 sound processor).

OTHER,NCT01146379,Does More Practice Improve Arm Movement After Stroke?,Dose Response of Movement Practice During Stroke Rehabilitation,Arm weakness happens a lot after a stroke. People often get physical or occupational therapy after their stroke to learn how to use their arm again. This study will help figure out how much therapy should be given to restore as much arm function as possible.,"Dose has emerged as a key factor promoting functional recovery after stroke. Currently, a lack of data on the dose-response relationship impedes progress in the field of stroke rehabilitation. The goal of the proposed project is to define the range of doses of movement practice that produce the greatest improvements in outcomes in people with chronic stroke. Borrowing from animal models of stroke, dose in humans can be quantified by the number of repetitions of task-specific practice.

Our central hypothesis is that there exists a range of doses for people with stroke, below which, there is minimal benefit, and above which, further practice does not result in further benefit. The range of beneficial doses is likely to vary based on the severity of motor deficits and the presence of non-motor deficits in other domains. Using a randomized, parallel dose-response design, we will evaluate the benefits of four different doses of task-specific upper extremity training with matched schedules of 1 hr sessions, 4 sessions/wk for 8 wks, in 100 people with chronic stroke. Total repetition doses to be evaluated (3200, 6400, 9600, \& individualized-maximum) are based on our preliminary data. The individualized-maximum group may extend their sessions beyond 8 wks until meeting defined stop criteria.

Our primary aim will test whether larger total doses result in better outcomes than smaller total doses. Benefits of the four doses will be evaluated at the impairment, activity, and participation levels, since understanding the dose-response relationship at all levels of measurement is critical for advancing rehabilitation research. We hypothesize that improvements will be greatest in the 9600 and individualized-maximum, followed by the 6400, and then the 3200 repetition dose groups. Our secondary aim is to characterize the dose-response relationship of upper extremity task-specific practice. With data from multiple assessment points, individual curve modeling will be used to estimate dose ranges, below which, there is minimal benefit, and above which, further practice does not result in further benefit. Furthermore, we will determine how various factors modify the dose estimates. We hypothesize that the severity of motor deficits will be the primary modifier of the dose-response relationship, with larger doses needed for those with more mild motor deficits. We further expect that needed doses will be larger for those with depression and hemispatial neglect.

Our team is well-positioned to investigate the critical issue of dose because of our expertise in stroke rehabilitation research and measurement, our understanding of the challenges of clinical practice and clinical research, and our ready access to this patient population. Expected outcomes from this project are empirically-driven estimates indicating the amount of movement practice required to drive maximal improvements and how these estimates can be individually modified for people undergoing stroke rehabilitation. Our estimates will immediately impact rehabilitation research and clinical practice. The importance of this project transcends stroke rehabilitation; our primary results will be of high value to many other rehabilitation populations also impeded by the lack of knowledge regarding dose-response relationships.",COMPLETED,,2010-05,2015-10,2015-10,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,85,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Intensive task-specific upper extremity rehabilitation"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""The experimental intervention consists of intensive task-specific upper extremity movement rehabilitation which are appropriately graded and progressed for each subject.

The wIRA is a harmless light source, that has been described before. We test the impact and clinical outcome of patients undergoing a one-time preoperative wIRA irradiation on postoperative wound healing.","Wound healing is a complex pathophysiological process that is related to pain, discomfort and immobility of patients and when not well controlled may lead to devastating and morbidity related wound infections. Furthermore, prolonged hospital stay, increased pain and consecutive increased drug consumption is often associated with postoperative wound infections. Although the average costs of wound infections are difficult to assess, there is no doubt that a prophylactic tool in controlling postoperative wound healing would have tremendous potential. Recent studies indicate that the application of different forms of thermal energy to the skin surface decreases postoperative wound infections significantly. It is known that high-normal arterial oxygen tension levels have decreased surgical wound infection from 11% to 5%. The application of water-filtered infrared A (wIRA) irradiation has been successfully applied in patients with ulcus cruris and superficial skin-tumors to alleviate pain and regulation of the body temperature in neonatology. The simple preoperative whole body warming for 30 min before surgery resulted in a statistically reduced occurrence of postoperative wound infections. A more recent study showed the beneficial effects of postoperative wIRA application on wound healing. The effects of wIRA leading to this success in therapy can be explained by thermal and non-thermal effects. A major advantage of the wIRA vs. the application of simple warming blankets lies upon the effective penetration of the wIRA applied energy within the deep subcutaneous tissue at depths of 2-3 cm. Further effects of the applied energy lead to vasodilation of capillaries with consecutive effective conduction of energetic blood flow into deeper tissue layers. Non-thermal effects of the wIRA application consist of direct stimulation and active immunomodulation by specialized immune cells. Furthermore, wIRA can induce protective proteins, e.g. ferritin in the skin and potentially influences common cross-talks within cells and extracellular matrices. These effects display regulatory roles in wound repair processes that may also be responsible for positive cosmetic results. More important for the clinical assessment of wound healing in the early phase of hospitalization is the effect of wIRA to significantly reduce postoperative pain. Surgery and postoperative pain evoke stress related effects that are induced by profound neuroendocrine changes in cytokine activity and related processes. Increased blood flow, due to vasodilation, helps to strongly eliminate accumulated pain mediators, lactic acid and potential bacterial toxins. The metabolism is induced and mediates also non-thermal effects such as attraction of immune cells and potential effects on nociceptors. These direct effects of wIRA can be easily followed when postoperative irradiation is performed. The problem of developing wound infections may rely within the first hours after and already during the operation, when the wound gets ""preconditioned"" with potential mediators or bacteria that may lead to postoperative encountered wound infections. A recent study indicated that immediate postoperative warming for 2 hours after hernia surgery may provide comparable benefits to seven days of warming. According to the idea of preventing deleterious preconditions in the process of wound healing, we tested here, the one time preoperative application of wIRA and its impact on postoperative wound healing and related clinical questions. Comparable to preoperative antibiotic single shot treatment we relied on the expansive impact of preoperative wIRA application.

OTHER,NCT02482779,Smartphone Application-Based Vital Sign Monitors,Comparison of Smartphone Application-Based Vital Sign Monitors to Devices Used in Clinical Practice,"Health-related applications for smartphones represent a new and popular market for consumer oriented products. These applications are generally not considered medical devices and, as such, are not under the purview of the Federal Drug Administration. Some of these applications purport to measure vital signs, but do not have any published data to confirm accuracy of such measurements and their developers have not been willing to divulge the methods by which vital sign readings are produced.

Use of unvalidated application derived data may contribute to patient harm as patients may make healthcare decisions based on the results these applications provide. This study aims to assess the accuracy of several such applications by comparing their findings to those of clinical vital sign monitors commonly used in the perioperative setting.","Recruitment of volunteers take place via announcement at the Anesthesiology Departmental Grand Rounds as well as by flyers posted in the UT Southwestern Department of Anesthesiology \& Pain Management.

After verbal consent is obtained, each volunteer will be placed in the seated position. Upper-arm non-invasive blood pressure will be measured using WelchAllyn Propaq CS via a standard size cuff placed in the standard fashion between the elbow and shoulder. Pulse oximetry measurement will be obtained using the WelchAllyn Propaq CS via the 4th digit of the hand.

The smart phone applications are Instant Blood Pressure, Instant Blood Pressure Pro, Pulse Oximeter and Pulse Oximeter Pro and purchased by the principal investigator and downloaded via the iTunes App Store onto an iPhone 5S with iOS 7.1.2 owned by the principal investigator. The application-based measurements will be performed by the volunteer according to the instructions from the application to the user without explanation from the investigators.

Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse (P) and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be collected from 100 volunteers. Serial measurements will be taken in the following fashion: right upper extremity, smartphone application measurements, left upper extremity and repeat smartphone application measurements. Thus, for each volunteer each data point referenced above will be recorded six times: two times using standard equipment readings (one per extremity) and four times with application-based readings (two times per application).

The two applications to measure blood pressure (Instant Blood Pressure and Instant Blood Pressure Pro) both utilize the camera and flashlight on the iPhone. In addition, the Instant Blood Pressure application also utilizes the microphone and instructs the user to hold the iPhone against the chest in a specific fashion to complete its measurement. Both applications also request the user to input certain demographic data: Gender, Age, Height and Weight. In addition, one application (Instant Blood Pressure Pro) also instructs the user to input data on ""Body Condition"" and provides the following options: Poor, Below Average, Average, Above Average, Good, Excellent and Athlete. The application does not provide any direction on how one is to distinguish between these options. If these applications measure data based on some yet unexplained function using the iPhone's onboard technology, then changing the demographic data should not alter the result of the measurement. In the same way, a sphygmomanometer or pulse oximeter does not need to know one's gender, height, weight or age to accurately measure blood pressure or pulse.

The application based vital sign readings may change in concert with changes to demographic variables even though clinical vital sign monitors remain relatively consistent. To test this hypothesis, in a subgroup (n=20), serial measurements using both clinical vital sign and application based vital sign readings will be evaluated by changing demographic variables in the application based vital sign monitors.

For this subgroup the volunteer will perform serial measurements with the following changes in demographic data for each application: Correct data, Age + 10, Age + 20, Age - 10, Age - 20, Weight - 10%, Weight - 25%, Weight + 10% and Weight +25%. Additionally, for the Instant Blood Pressure Pro application additional readings will be taken changing the ""Body Condition"" demographic as follows: Poor, Average, Good and Athlete. For each measurement taken using the applications another will be taken using the clinical monitor, or thirteen total readings per volunteer.",COMPLETED,,2015-01,2015-07,2015-06,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,120,ACTUAL,[],,,1

OTHER,NCT03672279,Validation of a Novel Self-Administered Cognitive Assessment Tool (CogCheck) in Patients With Mild and Major Neurocognitive Disorder Predominantly Due to Alzheimer's Disease,Validation of a Novel Self-Administered Cognitive Assessment Tool (CogCheck) in Patients With Mild and Major Neurocognitive Disorder Predominantly Due to Alzheimer's Disease,"Due to the demographical development, age-related diseases will drastically increase over the next decades. To face this healthcare challenge, early and accurate identification of cognitive impairment is crucial. The assessment of neurocognitive functioning ideally requires a tool that is short, easy to administer and interpret, and has high diagnostic accuracy. In this context, the use of computerized test batteries is receiving increasing attention. Compared to paper-pencil tests, computerized test batteries have many advantages. The possibility to measure reaction times may provide additional information. Moreover, test questions are always presented the exact same way, examiner-related bias is eliminated, and results are available immediately after examination. Due to the ability to adjust the level of difficulty to the performance of the individual, floor and ceiling effects may be minimized. Additionally, costs are reduced, and fewer materials and less trained personnel are required. Finally, big data approaches and the use of machine learning algorithms are becoming more popular in the field of clinical diagnostics, and computerized cognitive test batteries may facilitate future data collection to this aim.

In 2014, we developed a self-administered tablet computer program for the iPad (CogCheck) to assess preoperative cognitive functioning in surgery patients.

The cognitive tests used in the CogCheck application are identical or similar to the paper-and-pencil tests that are currently used in dementia diagnostics. Replacing some of the paper-and-pencil tests by a computerized test battery may facilitate the routine neuropsychological examinations. Thus, we aim to investigate the diagnostic accuracy and user-friendliness of CogCheck when applied in a cognitively impaired patient sample. In a first step, the diagnostic properties of CogCheck will be examined by differentiating between healthy controls and patients with mild or major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) predominantly due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data from healthy controls have been collected (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) in a previous normative study of CogCheck. Thus a further aim is to investigate the user-friendliness of CogCheck in patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD.

The primary aim of our study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of CogCheck for patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD in a German-speaking population.

Secondary aims are: (1) to examine the user-friendliness of CogCheck in patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD, (2) to compare the results between cognitively healthy individuals (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) and patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD on each of the CogCheck subtest, (3) to establish an algorithm with the CogCheck subtests that optimally distinguishes between cognitively healthy controls (EKNZ Req-2016-00393) and patients with mild or major NCD predominantly due to AD, (4) to compare the diagnostic properties of CogCheck with the ones of the currently used paper-pencil tests.",,RECRUITING,,2021-07-27,2024-12-31,2024-12-31,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,100,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""CogCheck"", ""type"": ""DIAGNOSTIC_TEST"", ""description"": ""Novel self-administered cognitive assessment tool"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DIAGNOSTIC_TEST,cogcheck,0

To quantify the degree of sympathetic blockade in the upper limb in patients with end stage renal failure produced during a regional anaesthetic technique, using laser Doppler flowmetry.

Hypothesis

Regional anaesthesia of the upper limb results in blockade of motor and sensory nerves, providing surgical and post-operative analgesia. Sympathetic nerves are also blocked resulting in local vasodilatation. This may be of benefit in surgery where enhanced blood flow is beneficial such as arterio-venous fistula creation. The degree and duration of sympathetic blockade produced by regional blocks however, has never been quantified.

OTHER,NCT03113279,Mechanisms of Age-Related Muscle Loss,"Influence of Increasing Physical Activity on Body Composition, Metabolic Health and Muscle Anabolism in Old Obese Adults","Two independent, but interrelated conditions that have a growing impact on healthy life expectancy and health care costs in developed nations are the age related loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia) and obesity. Sarcopenia affects approximately one third of adults over 60 years of age and more than 50% of those over 80 years, which is of concern when one considers that the most rapidly expanding population demographic in the UK is adults \>80 years of age.

Skeletal muscle is important in regulating blood glucose and insulin sensitivity. Thus, sarcopenia may play a role in exacerbating insulin resistance and progression toward Type II diabetes (T2D). Indeed, the highest incidence of T2D in the UK has been noted to occur in adults \>65 years. Obesity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases including T2D and cardiovascular disease. Progression towards obesity is associated with a concomitant decrease in muscle mass, producing an unfavorable ratio of fat to muscle. Thus, obesity in old age may exacerbate the progression of sarcopenia.

For the proposed study the investigators will conduct preliminary laboratory tests to characterize body composition, insulin sensitivity, systemic inflammation, aerobic capacity and muscle protein metabolism (in the fasted and fed state) in healthy older and obese older adults for comparison against healthy young individuals.","Twenty healthy young (aged 18-35), healthy old and obese older adults (aged ≥65) will be recruited. Old groups will be matched for age and sexual dimorphism. Obese participants will be classed as prediabetic based on a fasting A1C between 5.7 and 6.4% and impaired fasting glucose between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L. Obese participants will habitually take between 2000-5000 steps per day, whilst healthy young and old participants will complete \>5000 steps per day.

VISIT 1 Preliminary assessments - Over a 3day period, participants will be instructed to wear a portable pedometer, to allow visual feedback on step count, and an armband accelerometer to determine habitual daily energy expenditure and the intensity of physical activity. In addition, participants will log their dietary intake.

VISIT 2 Body composition and metabolic profiling After consuming a standardized meal the previous evening, participants will report to the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility in a 10 hour fasted state at approximately 09.00. Participants will be weighed in light clothing and blood pressure will be measured. Thereafter, body composition will be determined using dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXA) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) via ventilated hood and continuous gas collection. Following RMR, a catheter will be inserted into a forearm vein and a resting, fasted blood sample obtained to determine postprandial insulin sensitivity using the HOMA-IR index.

OTHER,NCT05695079,Efficacy of Electric Fans for Mitigating Thermal Strain in Older Adults During Heat Waves,Evaluating the Efficacy of Pedestal Fans for Limiting Heat Strain in Elderly Adults During Extreme Heat Events,"With the increasing regularity and intensity of hot weather and heat waves, there is an urgent need to develop heat-alleviation strategies able to provide targeted protection for heat-vulnerable older adults. While air-conditioning provides the most effective protection from extreme heat, it is inaccessible for many individuals. Air-conditioning is also energy intensive, which can strain the electrical grid and, depending on the source of electricity generation, contribute to increasing green house gas emissions. For these reasons, recent guidance has advocated the use of electric fans as a simple and sustainable alternative to air-conditioning. To date, however, only one study has assessed the efficacy of fan use in older adults and demonstrated that fans accelerate increases in body temperature and heart rate in a short-duration (\~2 hours) resting exposure to 42°C with increasing ambient humidity from 30-70%. While subsequent modelling has suggested that fans can improve heat loss via sweat evaporation in healthy older adults at air temperatures up to 38°C, there is currently no empirical data to support these claims. Further, that work assumed older adults were seated in front of a pedestal fan generating an airflow of 3·5-4·5 m/s at the front of the body. This airflow cannot be attained by most marketed pedestal fans. Studies are therefore needed to evaluate the efficacy of fans for preventing hyperthermia and the associated physiological burden in older adults in air temperatures below 38°C and determine whether the cooling effect of fans, if any, is evident at lower rates of airflow.

To address these knowledge gaps, this randomized crossover trial will evaluate body core temperature, cardiovascular strain, dehydration, and thermal comfort in adults aged 65-85 years exposed for 8 hours to conditions experienced during hot weather and heat waves in North America simulated using a climate chamber (36°C, 45% relative humidity). Each participant will complete three randomized exposures that will differ only in the airflow generated at the front of the body via an electric pedestal fan: no airflow (control), low airflow (\~2 m/s), and high airflow (\~4 m/s). While participants will spend most of the 8-hour exposure seated in front of the fan, they will also complete 4 x 10 min periods of 'activities of daily living' (\~2-2.5 METS, light stepping) at \~2 hour intervals to more accurately reflect activity patterns in the home.",,COMPLETED,,2022-12-01,2023-04-10,2023-04-10,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,DOUBLE,BASIC_SCIENCE,19,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""No cooling (control)"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""Participants are exposed to 36°C, 45% relative humidity for 8 hours without cooling intervention (control condition).

* Indication: Breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving surgery
* Primary objectives: To determine the effect of selective omission of intraoperative margin evaluation via frozen section on margin positive rate Secondary objectives: To determine the effect of selective omission of intraoperative margin evaluation via frozen section on reoperation rate, local recurrence rate, operation time, resection volume, medical cost and patient quality-of life
* Hypothesis: Omitting intraoperative margin evaluation via frozen section biopsy in selected breast cancer patients does not increase margin positive rate
* Study design: Randomized controlled trial
* Sample size: 1292 patients
* Procedures: breast conserving surgery +/- margin frozen section biopsy (+/- additional resection)","1.1 Preoperative work-up Preoperative breast MRI is recommended to assess multifocal/centric lesions and non-mass enhancement surrounding main mass. Preoperative needle localization or skin marking is done by each hospital's method.

1.2 Surgical procedure Initial wide excision is performed as usual. The recommended target gross margin is one finger breadth. Orientation of the specimen will be done according to each center's principle. Randomization for frozen section biopsy vs. omission is done intraoperatively, after initial wide excision. For the frozen section biopsy omission group, no further procedures will be done. For the frozen section biopsy group, frozen section biopsy is performed on the specimen or cavity by the operating surgeon. The precise method is decided by the surgeon's discretion, but the recommended method is as follows. A minimum 1 x 0.5cm size of breast parenchymal tissue will be excised at minimum four directions of the specimen or cavity with a thickness of approximately 0.1cm (Figure).

Additional resection according to frozen section biopsy result will be decided by the surgeon's discretion. After review of final pathology report, decision of second operation for re-excision will also be done by surgeon's discretion. A recommendation of considering re-excision for only a positive margin (tumor on inked margin) is noted but not mandatory. Data on additional resection or re-excision must all be reported.

1.3 Pathology procedure Evaluation procedure of the frozen section biopsy specimen and wide excision, additional excision specimen is done by each hospital's method. A pathology report of both intraoperative frozen section biopsy result and final pathology result of the frozen section biopsy tissue must be done. Gross specimen measurements (height x length x depth) must be specified on pathology report. Also margin status must be recorded, positive margin defined as ""no ink on tumor"" for DCIS and invasive cancer. Recording of margin distance from superior, inferior, medial, lateral, margin is recommended. If all margin distance is not feasible for recording, at least margin distance of closest margin must be recorded. The final pathology result of the additional resection specimen after frozen section result must describe whether residual cancer cells were present and the site of them. This is the same for re-operation resection specimens. Thorough microscopic examination for residual cancer cells in additional/re-operation resection specimens is warranted.

1.4 Postoperative care and adjuvant therapy Postoperative care will be performed as usual. Routine adjuvant care will be given, including adjuvant radiation therapy.

1.5 Follow-up The subject's participation of this clinical trial finishes at last fill in of postoperative quality-of-life questionnaire or after last surgery.

Annual clinical examination, mammography and breast sonography is recommended for 5-year local recurrence assessment. Local recurrence is defined as pathologically confirmed ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence.

1.6 Alternatives This is a randomization between two commonly accepted surgical techniques and there is not any oncological increased risk with either. All routine precautions will be taken to minimize overall surgical risk. Alternatives to the trial would be to have standard breast conserving surgery with or without intraoperative frozen section biopsy according to surgeon's discretion and patients will be informed of this. In addition, all patients will be informed of their option for mastectomy as well.

Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens can decrease the rate of toxicity/mortality in elderly patients, or in patients with poor medical condition. GVHD prophylaxis remains a challenging task after allo-SCT. The Flu-ivBu combination is a widely used RIC regimen, endorsed by EMA since July 2014. ATG in combination with cyclosporine-A ±mycophenolate mofetil is the backbone for GVHD prophylaxis in this setting. ATG can prevent GVHD with a good efficacy, but at the cost of a higher toxicity and profound immunosuppression, calling for more effective therapies. The most widely used RIC regimen in France incorporates fludarabine (Flu), intermediate doses of IV-busulfan (Bu) and anti-thymocyte globulins (ATG). While the use of ATG can prevent severe acute and chronic GVHD after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation from both HLA-identical sibling and unrelated donors, some data suggested that in-vivo T-cell depletion with ATG in the RIC setting may induce a higher risk of disease relapse. Also, ATG induces profound immune suppression and increase incidence of opportunistic infections, especially EBV-related complications (relative risk=4.9; 95% CI\[ 1.1-21.0\]; P=0.03).

On the other hand, high-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) was developed to facilitate HLA-haploidentical allo-SCT using unmanipulated bone marrow (BM) cells. PTCy was effective in preventing both acute and chronic GVHD given its capacity to preferentially eliminate allo-reactive T cells and preserve regulatory T cells, both of which impact allogeneic immune reactions. Subsequently, the efficacy of PTCy as sole GVHD prophylaxis after myeloablative conditioning when using BM was also shown. However, BM is not the preferred source of stem cells after RIC allo-SCT, and the potential efficacy of PTCy on preventing GVHD when using PBSCs (which is the most frequently used source of allogeneic cells worldwide) is debated.

The advent of PTCy therapy is nowadays on the cutting edge. Thus, the potential efficacy (and cost-effectiveness) of PTCy for GVHD prophylaxis may have a major ATG sparing potential. A recent single centre phase 2 study (n=49) suggested that PTCy alone may not be the preferred GVHD prophylaxis following a RIC transplant with PBSCs. Indeed, A matched cohort analysis compared outcomes to tacrolimus/methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis and indicated higher rates of acute GVHD grade II to IV (46% versus 19%; hazard ratio \[HR\], 2.8; P =0.02) and treatment-related mortality (HR, 3.3; P =0.035) and worse overall survival (HR, 1.9; P=0..04) with post-CY. Interpretation of the above non-randomized data is further complicated by heterogeneity (related and unrelated donors, BM and PBSC as stem cell source, different conditioning regimen), highlighting the need for a controlled randomized trial in a standardized setting.

The ultimate goal of this Phase IIB study is to assess the feasibility and inform the design of a subsequent phase III study. The present randomized trial is designed to compare the efficacy of the addition of PTCy to current standard of care with ATG after a Flu-Bu-based RIC regimen on GVHD prophylaxis. The protocol will use a novel endpoint for benchmarking interventions based on a composite primary endpoint of GVHD-free, relapse-free survival which measures freedom from ongoing morbidity and represents an ideal outcome measure after allo-SCT.",COMPLETED,,2017-04-06,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE2,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,94,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Cyclophosphamide"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""GVHD prophylaxis: All patients will receive post-transplant 50mg/Kg/day cyclophosphamide (day +3 and +4) AND cyclosporine-A alone in case of an HLA-sibling donor, or cyclosporine-A and mycophenolate-mofetil in case of an HLA-matched unrelated donor"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Anti-Thymocyte Globulin"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""GVHD prophylaxis: 2.5 mg/Kg/day ATG (Thymoglobuline®) for 2 consecutive days (day -2 and -1) All patients will receive cyclosporine-A alone in case of an HLA-sibling donor, or cyclosporine-A and mycophenolate-mofetil (MMF) in case of an HLA-matched unrelated donor."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Conditioning regimen"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""30 mg/m2/day fludarabine for 5 days (day-6 to day-2) 130 mg/m2/day IV busulfan once daily for 2 days (day -4 and -3)"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG;DRUG;DRUG,cyclophosphamide;anti-thymocyte globulin;conditioning regimen,1

It is intended to emulate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance claims data, the trial listed below/above. Although many features of the trial cannot be directly emulated in healthcare claims, key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and inclusion/exclusion criteria, were selected to proxy those features from the trial. Randomization is also not emulable in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a statistical balancing of measured covariates according to standard practice. Investigators assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect estimate and that failure to replicate RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims data for emulation for a range of possible reasons and does not provide information on the validity of the original RCT finding.

However, when administered it can also slow the breathing of patients and cause others to have upper airway obstruction (such as snoring) which can impede proper spontaneous breathing. Ketamine is an agent that is capable of providing both pain control and sedation while having either minimal effect on breathing or promoting spontaneous breathing. Combining Ketamine with Propofol has the potential to reduce the total amount of Propofol used resulting in a procedure being performed under the same level of sedation but without the downside of reduced spontaneous breathing. Patients who are obese (defined as body mass index greater than 35) tend to be even more susceptible to this effect of Propofol. The researchers are investigating whether the addition of Ketamine will indeed allow for this continued comfortable level of sedation while promoting continued spontaneous breathing in obese patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopies.","Upon patient arrival to endoscopy suite heart rate (HR), pre-procedure baseline blood pressure (BP), and pre-procedure oxygen saturation (SPO2) via pulse oximeter are recorded in endoscopy holding area, patient alertness and orientation assessed (respond to name, know the state, know the hospital, know the year, know the season).

If neither proves superiority, the investigators can justify using cost to determine which device to use in patient care.","New bariatric patients who have elected for a sleeve gastrectomy as part of standard of care will be invited to participate in the study during the bariatric clinic at William Beaumont Army Medical Center. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. These patients will be consented in the bariatric clinic by a research coordinator (Doreen Bandari-Spaulding) or physician listed on the study if the coordinator is unavailable.

Three folders will be made, one for each bariatric surgeon, and 25 Covidien cards and 25 Ethicon cards will be placed into each for a total of 150 patients. All bariatric surgeons are trained and familiar with both devices. Once consented, a card will be removed at random to determine which stapler will be used. Bioabsorbable staple line reinforcement will be utilized with both staplers. Once in the operating room, the case start time, time from first staple firing to completion of sleeve, total stapler loads required, number of staple misfires, character of any staple line bleeding, and time for tech to load each cartridge will be recorded on a data collection sheet by a research resident, listed as an associative investigator on this protocol. The subject's post-operative course will follow the bariatric protocol. During follow-up, they will be monitored for weight loss, post-operative complications, and any other required interventions. This information will be obtained by reviewing the subject's medical record after follow-up appointments. Per the institutional bariatric protocol, subjects will follow-up at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and annually. If a subject withdraws consent for the study prior to surgery, they will still receive surgery and perioperative treatment in line with institutional protocol, and they will be withdrawn and create a vacancy for a new subject. If a subject withdraws consent after surgery, data collection will cease for that subject. The investigators will clarify whether they want all data to be removed from the study or if they simply want no more data to be entered into the study and abide by their wishes, and they will remain in the original randomized group in accordance with intention-to-treat principles.",RECRUITING,,2018-01-22,2021-03,2020-03,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,TREATMENT,150,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Covidien iDrive"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Surgery performed with Covidien powered stapler"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Ethicon Echilon"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""Surgery performed with Ethicon powered stapler"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE;DEVICE,covidien idrive;ethicon echilon,0

However, many side effects are associated with its use, such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, itching, urinary retention, constipation, hyperalgesia and impaired immune function. Therefore, alternative techniques and drugs have been used to replace their use. One is the intravenous infusion of lidocaine, a local anesthetic widely used in anesthetic practice. Another is intravenous infusion of magnesium sulphate, a bivalent salt used as a central nervous system depressor, reducing intracranial hypertension, in the treatment of epilepsy; eclampsia; in chronic alcoholism; in hyaline membranes, such as hyperosmotic diuretic; in malnutrition; hypomagnesaemia; in thrombotic microangiopathy; in sickle cell anemia, uterine tetany and atypical ventricular tachycardia. Studies show that the use alone or combined of lidocaine and magnesium sulphate during surgery significantly decreased postoperative pain. The mechanisms of analgesia this local anesthetic in surgical trauma may be blocking neuronal transmission in the lesion site alleviating neurogenic response, and anti-inflammatory systemic intrinsic activity. Intraoperative lidocaine promotes, besides analgesia, decreased consumption of both inhalational anesthetic and opioids; faster return of bowel movements; decreasing the production of interleukins and reduction of airway reactivity. This anesthetic also has significant anti-inflammatory properties, reduces cytokine release both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting neutrophil activation. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are critically involved in the induction and maintenance of neuronal hyperexcitability after traumatic events, therefore, the use of NMDA antagonists before the incision reduces the excitability of the central nervous system and its result is the reduction of clinical hyperalgesia. Magnesium sulphate is an antagonist of glutamate NMDA receptor, which gives analgesic, anticonvulsant and sedative. It acts as a natural physiological calcium antagonist regulating access to the intracellular space. Shows the effect of muscle relaxation by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, thereby hypermagnesaemia decreases sensitivity to acetylcholine of the endplate and the potential amplitude endplate. Besides there are few studies with use of these adjuvants during the perioperative period, the intravenous injection of local anesthetic still arouses oddity among professionals; therefore, the investigators interest in the subject.

The patients underwent a prospective, randomized, double blind study, in which the examiners responsible for intra and post-operative will not know which group they were randomly allocated: Lidocaine group (n = 30); Lidocaine and Magnesium group (n = 30); Magnesium group (n = 30) or Remifentanil group (n = 30). Rapid infusion of 0.9% saline 500 ml, in the M and LM group, is added to this solution the loading dose of magnesium sulfate with 50 mg/kg and in group L will only be infused saline 0.9% . Two infusion pumps containing the result of randomization: Lidocaine 3 mg/kg/h and 0.9% saline (L group); magnesium sulphate 15 mg/kg/h and 0.9% saline (M group); lidocaine 3 mg/kg/h and magnesium sulphate 15 mg/kg/hr (LM group); and Remifentanil group (R group).

In the clinical record, the following information will be emphasized: Blood pressure and heart rate intraoperative, perioperative side effects, quantify pain by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (ranging from 0 to 10 cm, zero being found when the patient is no pain and ten, with maximum or unbearable pain), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), consisting of a list of phrases (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, intense pain, maximum pain) and qualification of pain assessed by the amount of analgesics required postoperatively and the time to request them.

The results were analyzed statistically with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, EUA) using parametric and nonparametric tests, depending on the nature of the variables studied. Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Measures of central tendency (means) and dispersion (standard deviation) were used. The level of significance was set at \< 0.05.

The vast majority of AML patients relapses within two years after start of therapy1,2. In Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL, AML M3), all-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA; Tretinoin) induces differentiation and subsequently clinical remission. So far effective differentiation therapy does not exist in other AML subtypes. Recent preclinical data suggest that the combinatorial use of ATRA and tranylcypromine (TCP), an irreversible Monoamine-Oxidase (MAO) and Lysin-specific demethylase (LSD) inhibitor that also inhibits LSD1 (a histone H3 Lysine 4 demethylase), induces leukemia cell differentiation and leukemic stem cell exhaustion in vitro and in vivo in non-APL AML subtypes.

In this Phase I/II study the investigators will explore the feasibility, safety, as well as efficacy and of Tretinoin/TCP treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or in patients with AML who are not eligible for intensive treatment. Patients will be treated with daily increasing doses of TCP (initially 10 mg/day, then +10 mg each day up to 80mg/d). After 7 days, ATRA will be added at a fixed dose (45 mg/sqm/day). Overall, 16 evaluable patients are going to be treated. The primary endpoint is the fraction of patients that achieve CR, CRp( complete response with incomplete recovery of platelets), CRi (complete response with incomplete recovery of granulocytes) and PR. Secondary endpoints are tolerability, safety as well as progression-free survival and overall survival. Serum levels of TCP will be regularly analyzed. Pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed with analyses of the inhibition of LSD1 by TCP. Further analyses will address the changes in Histone H3 lysine 4 tri demethylase (H3K4me3) levels in AML blasts and the differentiation status of AML blasts.

Examination and diagnosis:

Examination and selection of patients will be done according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. For every patient, personal data, medical and dental history will be recorded. Clinical examination of labial surfaces with active initial lesions will be done by mouth mirror and explorer with proper direct illumination after gentle dryness for 5 seconds to assess the color, texture and light reflection. To avoid intra-examiner errors, all subjects will be examined by the same examiner. After clinical inspection and DIAGNOdent examination, all patients with ICDAS score 1\&2 and with DIAGNOdent score (8-15) will be included in the study.

Informed Consent: Eligible participants will be informed with the procedure and an informed consent will be signed.

b) Moringa Oleifera-based varnish laboratory preparation: The Moringa Oleifera extract and varnish will be prepared in the National Research Centre (Giza, Egypt). Moringa Oleifera leaves will be collected, washed then dried and grinded. Afterwards, the extract of the dried powder will be prepared through extraction with 80% ethyl alcohol. The combined ethanolic extract will then be evaporated till dryness at 45 °C using rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. The obtained mark will be dissolved in water, frozen and lyophilized to obtain lyophilized dry powder then dental varnish will be prepared at a concentration of 200ml/mg. This concentration is recommended by Younis et al.,(2020) as the more the concentration of loaded Moringa Oleifera extract, the more mineral deposition and remineralization enhancement.

After preparing the varnish, it will be stored in single-use form dark bottles to avoid any possible light interactions, then the varnish will be sterilized using steam autoclave Samaha et al.,(2023).

c) Remineralizing materials application:

Teeth preparation:

Teeth with initial carious lesions will be polished with a fluoride-free prophylaxis paste. Moisture control will be done using an air syringe and high-volume suction.

Moring Oleifera Varnish application Using a disposable bond brush, the varnish will be painted on the diagnosed surfaces, then the patient will be instructed to avoid brushing or flossing and to avoid hard and sticky food or any products that may contain alcohol (oral rinses, beverages, etc.) for the next 4 hours after application.

MI Varnish application

The varnish will be applied on the clean surfaces according to manufacturer instructions as follows:

1. The foil cover of the MI Varnish unit dosage bottle will be peeled-off and MI Varnish will be stirred with the disposable brush before application.
2. The surfaces will be covered with a thin uniform layer using a disposable bond brush to avoid clumping.
3. The area will be allowed to become wet to ensure the setting of the varnish.
4. Patients will be instructed to avoid brushing or flossing and to avoid hard and sticky food or any products that may contain alcohol (oral rinses, beverages, etc.) for the next 4 hours after varnish application.

Outcomes:

Primary outcome: Remineralization efficacy The DIAGNOdent will be used to quantify objectively the white spot lesions. For every patient, measurements with the DIAGNOdent will be performed and calibrated on a sound enamel (incisal one third of the central incisor) before actual readings. The teeth will be scanned carefully with the tip held in contact with the tooth surface and tilted around the measuring site so that fluorescence could be collected from all directions. Maximum reading will be recorded Singh et al.,(2016).

DIAGNOdent scores: Shalaan et al.,(2023)

* Score 1: 0-4 (healthy tooth structure)
* Score 2: 5-10 (outer half enamel caries)
* Score 3: 11-20 (inner half enamel caries)
* Score 4: 21+ (dentin caries).

Secondary outcome: Caries lesion activity assessment Nyvad criteria will be used to detect the carious lesion activity. The Nyvad criteria are visual tactile caries classification system which can assess the caries activity and severity. Nyvad criteria includes all stages of caries from clinically sound surfaces to non-cavitated carious lesions and microcavitated lesions in enamel up to frank cavitations in dentine Nyvad and Baelum (2018).

Lesion activity can be detected through surface topography and texture; an active lesion in enamel is rough upon probing with the tip of a ball ended probe, unlike the inactive lesion which appears to be shiny and smooth upon probing. These surface phenomena are the visual representation of the demineralization activity of the dental biofilm. Due to scattering of light, rough active non-cavitated enamel lesions appear dull to the naked eye, unlike the surfaces of inactive lesions which appears glossy due to specular reflection. Nyvad and Baelum (2018).

OTHER,NCT02474979,Reduced Pressure for Less Pressure Ulcers,Reduced Pressure for Less Pressure Ulcers. Effect of the CBPM-system in a Swedish University Hospital,"Pressure ulcers (PU) cause pain and discomfort to affected patients, as well as considerable costs for society. The present study will evaluate the effect of the Continuous Bedside Pressure Mapping (CBPM)- system on PU prevalence and incidence. A RCT including 180 patients will be conducted in a geriatric setting in a Swedish University hospital","Background The first national PU prevalence study in Sweden conducted in 2011 showed a prevalence of 16.6% (n=16 466) in hospital settings. High age and reduced mobility/activity are main risk factors. International evidence-based guidelines for prevention of PU are available. Pressure relief (e.g repositioning, mattresses, chair cushions, heel cushions) is the main stay of preventive measures. Recent research shows that PU prevention is not a high priority. For example, the corner stone of prevention, repositioning, is not conducted for risk patients.

Aim To evaluate the effect of the CBPM-system on the prevalence and incidence of PU in hospital setting

Method Design: A randomised controlled trial will be conducted Sample: All patients admitted to the geriatric unit. Intervention: The CBPM-system will be used from admittance to discharge (not more than 14 days). Standard PU prevention (PU reducing mattress, floating heels, repositioning) Control group: Standard PU prevention (PU reducing mattress, floating heels, repositioning) Randomisation: Sealed envelopes will be used. Procedure: Two study nurses are responsible for inclusion of patients and data collection on day 1,3,7 and discharge. A photo will be taken of any PU. A PU expert will assess the photos after completed data collection (PU category 1-4). She will be blinded to group allocation.

Power calculation: The primary outcome of interest is the PU prevalence. Previous point prevalence studies in this geriatric unit shows a prevalence of 45%. The investigators goal is that the CBPM-system results in 20% decrease in the PU prevalence. In order to have 80% power to detect such a decrease with a two-sided two-sample proportions test at the 5% level, 89 patients per treatment group is needed. Intention-to-treat principals will be used.

Discussion The prevalence of PU, as well as prevention to risk patients are quality indicators in health care. National studies reveal an urgent need for quality improvement, New nursing methods and equipment must be systematically and scientifically evaluated.The results of this study will be valuable for nursing education and in international and national patient safety work to prevent PU. The results will also be valuable for other health professionals (physicians, physical and occupational therapists).",COMPLETED,,2015-03,2015-12,2015-12,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,PREVENTION,190,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""CBPM-system"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""The bed is equipped with a pressure sensing mat including thousands of sensors.

OTHER_GOV,NCT06560879,Effectiveness of Probiotics for the Prevention of Gastrointestinal Toxicity in Children with Leukemia,Effectiveness of Probiotics for the Prevention of Gastrointestinal Toxicity and Changes in Gut Microbiota in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common malignant neoplasm in children. Although chemotherapy achieves remission in over 70% of cases, it can cause gastrointestinal toxicity in up to 32.5%. Some studies suggest that administering probiotics reduces this risk, but the evidence remains inconsistent.

Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of administering L. casei, L. rhamnosus or B. bifidum compared to a placebo for the prevention of gastrointestinal toxicity, decreased intestinal permeability, and changes in intestinal microbiota in pediatric patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving chemotherapy.

Methods: A total of 120 participants aged 6 to 17 years, diagnosed with ALL and receiving consolidation phase chemotherapy without gastrointestinal comorbidities, will be included. Participants will be administered daily 2 capsules containing either 1) L. casei, 2) L. rhamnosus, 3) B. bifidum or 4) placebo daily for 8 weeks. The clinical status of the participants will be evaluated weekly by the oncology service to determine the presence of gastrointestinal toxicity and adverse events. Changes in intestinal permeability will be assessed by measuring beta-lactoglobulin in a blood sample using the ELISA technique, while changes in the intestinal microbiota will be analyzed by genomic sequencing at baseline and at the end of follow-up.

Statistical analysis: Descriptive analysis will use measures of central tendency and dispersion. For quantitative variables, the mean and standard deviation or median with minimum and maximum values will be calculated depending on the distribution type. Frequencies and proportions will be calculated for qualitative variables, presented in tabular and graphical form. To compare the quantitative variables between the four interventions, a multi-way ANOVA test will be used.

The risk of gastrointestinal toxicity and adverse events will be analyzed by calculating the relative risk and 95% confidence interval. Differences between the interventions will be analyzed using survival analysis with the Kaplan-Meier and Log-Rank tests. Sequencing data will be analyzed using the Qiime2 program, filtered to generate a phylogenetic tree using the Silva database. Corresponding plots will be generated for each taxonomic level. Alpha (intra-group) and Beta (inter-group) diversity will be presented by ordination plots using principal component analysis with the ANCOM program","Background Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature lymphoid cells. It is the most common neoplasm in children, representing up to 53.1% of all oncologic processes in Mexico \[1-6\]. Fortunately, with the current chemotherapeutic treatments, disease remission is achieved in 98% of cases; however, the chemotherapeutic treatments have side effects that can lead to gastrointestinal toxicity (7.7 to 32.5%), which is associated with up to 50% mortality.

Among the most common gastrointestinal manifestations resulting from this toxicity are mucositis, pancreatitis (2 to 8%), diarrhea (10 to 82%), and colitis associated with decreased Bacillus spp and Bidifobacterium spp, increasing the risk of necrosis and intestinal perforation of the terminal ileum and cecum. Hence, several studies have been conducted to identify agents that can reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity like as probiotics which are a group of saprophytic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa) that live in equilibrium on the skin and mucous membranes, mainly in the intestine, have garnered attention.

Probiotics are known to have several beneficial functions such as promoting the absorption of carbohydrates, short-chain fatty acids and calcium; facilitating the synthesis of lipids and vitamins; modulate and reduce the concentration of inflammatory mediators in the intestinal mucosa; improve mucosal blood flow, thus reducing the risk of ischemic areas in the intestine; and strengthen the immune system.

Although research has been conducted on the use of probiotics to prevent or reduce the toxic effects of chemotherapy, the results are still inconclusive because the effect of probiotics has been analyzed in multiple combinations, which makes it difficult to distinguish the specific effects per phylum. This complicates the generation of standardized therapeutic schemes to improve the quality of care of these patients. If this project successfully identifies the effectiveness and safety of these probiotics, it will enable to development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the quality of healthcare for these patients, reducing the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal complications secondary to the administration of chemotherapy.

Objective To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum compared to placebo in reducing the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, decreasing intestinal permeability, and changing intestinal microbiota without the development of adverse effects in pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL receiving consolidation chemotherapy in the Oncology Service of the Instituto Nacional de Pediatría.

The sample size was calculated based on data from the study by Reyna-Figueroa, which reported a 0% incidence of diarrhea during the administration L. rhamnosus compared to 10% in participants who did not receive probiotics. Using the formula for proportions, with an alpha error of 0.05, 80% power, and estimating a loss rate of 20%, a sample size of 30 participants was determined for each of the four groups.

Statistical analysis A descriptive analysis will be performed using measures of central tendency to understand the characteristics of the studied sample and to determine the type of distribution of each variable using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff normality test. For quantitative variables, the mean and standard deviation or median with minimum and maximum values will be calculated, depending on the type of distribution and summarized in tabular form; and data graphically represented by boxplot or bars chats as appropriate.

To compare the quantitative variables between the four interventions, a multi-way ANOVA test will be used. For qualitative variables, the chi-squared test will be used to compare the groups, adjusting for the nutritional status of the participants.

The risk of gastrointestinal toxicity and adverse events will be analyzed by the relative risk or Peto's odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Differences between the interventions will be analyzed using survival analysis with the Kaplan-Meier and Log-Rank tests. Sequencing data will be analyzed using the Qiime2 program, filtered to generate a phylogenetic tree using the Silva database. Corresponding plots will be generated for each taxonomic level. Alpha (intra-group) and Beta (inter-group) diversity will be presented by ordination plots using principal component analysis with the ANCOM program.

Parents or caregivers will complete the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) to assess their child's sleep before and after treatment.

The study will include 20 children with a narrow upper jaw, and a control group of children without this condition. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Will the 3D scans show significant changes in the face after therapy?
* Will the dental scans show a larger palate volume after treatment?
* Will parents/caregivers notice an improvement in their children's sleep problems after therapy? Researchers will compare 3D facial and dental scans, as well as PSQ results, before and one year after therapy to see if the treatment makes a difference.

Participants will:

* Receive orthodontic treatment to expand the upper jaw.
* Have their sleep related breathing problems assessed by parents or caregivers using the PSQ before and after treatment.
* Have 3D scans of their face and teeth taken before and after treatment.","This comprehensive clinical study focuses on evaluating the therapeutic impact of orthodontic maxillary expansion treatment on sleep disorder assessments in children, as reported by their parents or guardians using the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ). Maxillary transverse constriction is a developmental disorder that can adversely affect the orofacial region, potentially influencing breathing patterns during sleep. The primary objective is to investigate whether orthodontic intervention to widen the upper jaw can lead to favorable developmental outcomes in the orofacial region and potentially alleviate sleep-related breathing disorders.

The study will involve 20 patients diagnosed with transverse maxillary constriction, identified through 3D scans of their face and dentition, compared against a control group of individuals without such constriction. Before and one year after treatment, participants will undergo 3D scanning of their facial structure and dentition, complemented by the completion of PSQ questionnaires by their parents or guardians. The study\&#39;s hypotheses propose that following treatment, there will be notable changes in the mid-facial region evident from 3D facial scans, an increase in palate volume as indicated by dental scans, and a moderate improvement in reported sleep disorder symptoms based on parental observations.

The research methodology incorporates non-invasive 3D facial scanning technology, a methodological advancement that allows for precise assessment of facial changes pre-treatment and post-treatment. This approach contrasts with traditional 2D imaging, offering more detailed and accurate data on structural alterations. The study also highlights the utility of PSQ as a validated tool for evaluating sleep disorders in children, avoiding the need for expensive polysomnography.

By utilizing advanced imaging techniques and validated questionnaires, researchers seek to objectively measure treatment outcomes and correlate them with improvements in sleep quality and respiratory function. The study will utilize specialized equipment such as the Bellus 3D facial scanner and the Audaxceph software.

Ultimately, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the relationship between maxillary expansion therapy and sleep disorder improvement in children, potentially paving the way for optimized treatment protocols and improved patient outcomes sleep related breathing problems.",RECRUITING,,2024-04-08,2027-07,2025-10,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,SINGLE,TREATMENT,20,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""maxillary expansion using hyrax expander"", ""type"": ""DEVICE"", ""description"": ""The rapid expansion of the upper jaw will be performed using palatal expander with hyrax screw, which will be activated 2x a day, until the needed width is reached (according to the cast analysis)."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DEVICE,maxillary expansion using hyrax expander,0

There are racial differences in carbohydrate metabolism that are potentially linked to complications during pregnancy and to increased risks of obesity and diabetes in later life. The investigators will explore the use of indexes of insulin status to identify the metabolic risk profile of pregnant women which may vary by race. Understanding whether there are differences which vary by race may influence clinical screening and treatment of pregnant women.,"The major goal of our proposed study is to validate a new approach to estimating insulin sensitivity and ß-cell function in African-American women compared to non-Hispanic white women in southern Louisiana who are at a high risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We will determine whether the whole body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) and insulinogenic index (IGI) \[derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)\] can be used during 24-28 weeks of pregnancy to accurately estimate the degree of insulin resistance relative to ß-cell function in women with GDM in those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) as well as those who are glucose tolerant. Fasting values will also be assessed using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B) to evaluate insulin resistance and ß-cell function. We will explore the potential use of these measures to define the metabolic risk profile of these pregnant women and compare them with obstetric outcomes. We will determine if there are differences in risk that vary by race. Second, given the high likelihood that women who manifest GDM will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), identification of these patients by ethnic group or other independent determinants will permit intervention after delivery that might delay or prevent the onset of type 2 DM.",COMPLETED,,2006-01,2009-12,2009-08,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,175,ACTUAL,[],,,1

One of the groups will receive daily photodynamic Lumoral treatment for 2 months in a home care unit according to a separate instruction manual. At the beginning of the study, all subjects will receive an oral cleaning and will also be provided with electric toothbrushes. In addition, residents and care home personnel will be instructed on daily tooth cleaning.

During the study, all participants will undergo clinical measurements and an assessment of the oral inflammatory load. The samples will be stored for later analysis. In addition, residents or care home personnel answer questions about oral self-care. These measurements and examinations will be carried out at the start of the study and two months after the start of the study. After the end of the study, participants will continue to be treated according to their usual care and individual care plan.","The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of regular antibacterial photodynamic treatment in service accommodation on the oral hygiene of elderly people. The information from this study can be used to promote oral hygiene among residents in 24-hour care.

Lumoral is a CE-marked medical home appliance that has been shown to be effective in reducing plaque development and the amount of harmful bacteria in plaque. The efficacy of the device is based on an antibacterial photodynamic process, whereby a photosensitive substance in Lumorinse attaches itself to the bacterial coating and is activated as an antibacterial agent by light. The antibacterial effect is directly targeted at the plaque, reducing the impact on the normal oral flora. Preliminary studies have shown that the method reduces the inflammatory factors associated with periodontitis.

The study is being carried out in collaboration with the City of Helsinki Oral Health Department, the Metropolia University of Applied Sciences Oral Care Teaching Hospital and the University of Helsinki Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The registrar of the study is the University of Helsinki. The study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and ISO 14155 (""Clinical trials on medical devices. Good Clinical Practice"").

The target population of the study will be residents in 24-hour care with at least 10 of their own teeth, who are judged by the caregiver to be able to participate in the study and who give written informed consent to participate in the study.

Approximately 40 people will participate in the study. They will be recruited from the City of Helsinki's service homes. The subjects will be randomized into two groups.

Consumption on Blood Lipid Levels and Hormones Regulating Appetite and Satiety: Randomized Crossover Clinical Trials,"Introduction: Overweight and obesity are associated with an unbalanced energy intake caused by unhealthy dietary habits, including a constant consumption of energy-dense foods, saturated and trans fats, refined sugars, along with a deficient protein and dietary fiber intake. Pulse consumption has been demonstrated to improve long-term body weight management. Despite these benefits, in several regions, the consumption of pulses does not meet the local recommendations. Consequently, pulse research has increased widely in order to provide food alternatives reformulated with pulses to promote their consumption.

Hypothesis: The consumption of a common bean baked snack (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and cooked beans increases satiety, reduces energy intake and produce a low glycemic response in people with overweight and normal weight.

Objectives: Evaluate the acute effect of a common bean baked snack and cooked bean consumption on subjective satiety and energy intake in people with overweight and normal weight.

OTHER,NCT01713179,Effects of Oral Mucolytics on Tear Film and Ocular Surface,,"Ambroxol is a metabolite of bromhexine and possesses mucokinetic and secretolytic properties that are also found in mucolytic agents.1 Ambroxol has been used for decades for the treatment of respiratory disorders associated with excessive mucus, including chronic inflammatory pulmonary conditions, bronchitis, and pneumonia.2,3 The drug changes the biophysical properties of secretions by degrading the mucin polymers, deoxyribonucleic acid, fibrin in airway secretions, and by generally decreasing viscosity.4 In addition, ambroxol increases cyclic nucleotide (cAMP or cGMP),5 which can theoretically increase tear secretion.6 Many systemic medications, such as antihistamines, antidepressants, diuretics, acne drugs, and certain blood pressure medicines can cause or exacerbate a dry eye.7,8 On the other hand, several topical medications, including mucolytics such as ambroxol and bromhexine, may be used to treat tear-deficient dry eyes by promoting lacrimal gland function.9 However, the effects of mucoactive agents on the tear film have not been investigated systemically, and mucoactive agents may have a disturbing effect on the tear film because they modify mucin.10,11 The tear film is composed of 3 unique layers, including the outermost lipid layer, the middle aqueous layer, and the innermost mucus layer; this structure enables it to perform many functions.12 The lipid layer acts as a barrier to prevent tear film evaporation, and the aqueous layer supplies oxygen and important nutrients to the cornea.13 The mucin layer, secreted mostly by conjunctival goblet cells, coats the corneal surface rendering it hydrophilic, and anchors the tear film to the corneal surface.14 Deficiencies in the amount of tear production or alteration in tear composition can lead to ocular surface disease.15 Although many studies have focused on aqueous-deficient dry eye syndrome,16-18 the effect of mucin layer defects on the tear film has not been thoroughly studied. Furthermore, very few reports have determined the effects of oral mucolytic agents on the tear film and ocular surfaces, although a study has reported that filamentary keratopathy was treated with debridement of filaments and application of topical mucolytic agents such as acetylcysteine eyedrops. In the present study, we investigated the effects of oral ambroxol on tear film and ocular surface.

INDUSTRY,NCT04435379,Study to Assess VPM1002 in Reducing Hospital Admissions and/or Severe Respiratory Infectious Diseases in Elderly in COVID-19 Pandemic,"A Phase III, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicentre, Clinical Trial to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of VPM1002 in Reducing Hospital Admissions and/or Severe Respiratory Infectious Diseases in Elderly in the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic by Modulating the Immune System","The aim of this study is to investigate whether vaccination of elderly with VPM1002 could reduce hospital admissions and/or severe respiratory infectious diseases in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic .

VPM1002 is a vaccine that is a further development of the old Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which has been used successfully as a vaccine against tuberculosis for about 100 years, especially in developing countries. VPM1002 has been shown in various clinical studies to be significantly safer than the BCG vaccine.

VPM1002 strengthens the body's immune defence and vaccination with BCG reduces the frequency of respiratory diseases. It is therefore assumed that a VPM1002 vaccination could also provide (partial) protection against COVID-19 disease caused by the ""new corona virus"" SARS-CoV 2.","Based on the evidence that BCG \[Bacille Calmette-Guérin\] vaccine

1. can potentiate immune responses to other vaccines through induction of trained innate immunity and heterologous adaptive immunity, and
2. can reduce the incidence of respiratory infections, exert antiviral effects in experimental models, and reduce viremia in an experimental human model of viral infection, it is hypothesized that BCG vaccination may induce (partial) protection against the susceptibility to and/or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

VPM1002 is being developed with the aim to replace BCG by a vaccine that has a better safety profile and superior efficacy. Evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrate that VPM1002 is safer and is more immunogenic than the existing BCG vaccine (for more information, please revert to the IB). It is therefore anticipated that VPM1002 will also perform better in reducing the severity of the symptoms of an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 than the BCG vaccine. Further, manufacturing of VPM1002 using state-of-the-art production methods will help hasten the production of millions of doses in a very short time and thus would be beneficial in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation.

The current trial will assess the efficacy and safety of VPM1002 to reduce the hospital admissions and clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the elderly population in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by modulating the immune system.

A total of 2038 adults aged 60 or above will be enrolled across involved clinical trial sites in Germany. Informed consent will be obtained from the subjects willing to take part in the trial. This will be followed by assessment of the eligibility criteria. Subjects who fulfil the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose (0.1 ml) of either VPM1002 or Placebo.

All subjects will be requested to sign into a web-based tool designed for this trial. Every subject is encouraged to name a designated caregiver who may provide follow-up data in case of hospitalisation or severe illness of the study subject. All subjects will be followed-up entirely remotely. The questionnaires will be designed to collect data regarding hospitalisation, adverse events (AE)/serious adverse events (SAE), ICU admissions and other secondary endpoints. The investigators will review the outcome and safety data.

The duration of follow-up will be 240 days.

It is also to study the influence of the intraocular pressure difference on OA blood flow in the two first groups. Furthermore, the investigators want to understand the relationship between ocular dynamics, blood flow and structural alternations of the optic nerve head (ONH). The rationale behind the study is to improve knowledge of the pathogenesis of glaucoma.","The investigators will investigate the OA blood flow, intraocular pressure (IOP) and structural properties of the optic nerve.

The investigators will include also patients with intraocular hypertension with and without pseudoexfoliation in order to study how changes in IOP interact with OA blood flow and the structural properties of the optic nerve in a group that does not develop glaucoma. In addition, the investigators will investigate patients that develop glaucoma in spite of a normal IOP. Therefore, the investigators will study three fundamentally different groups (G1, G2 and G3) of patients as well as a control group of healthy subjects (G4):

G1: Newly diagnosed and untreated Glaucoma (optic and visual field damage exists).

G2: Ocular hypertension with IOP ≥ 23 mmHg (i.e. only elevated eye pressure).

G3: Normal Tension Glaucoma.

G4: Healthy subjects.

Each group will include 25 patients apart from G2 where 50 patients will be included, half of which have pseudoexfoliation syndrome. The study will be performed in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration and is approved by the regional ethical board.

Study protocol overview:

Study protocol consists of two parts of examinations repeated with approximately one week between: Each part is divided into two examinations; one at the Department of radiology followed by one at the Department of ophthalmology. The measurements are repeated approximately one week later for G1 and G2.

Day 1: First, MRI scans on the brain to measure the blood flow of OA as well as the structural and morphological properties of the ON (see method below). Second, just after MRI examination, the patient will be examined at the Department of ophthalmology. Measurement of intraocular pressure, ocular pulse amplitude, central corneal thickness, bulb length, investigation with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and blood pressure will be performed. The patients from G3 (Normal Pressure Glaucoma) will participate only in Day 1, since most cases already has pressure-lowering treatment. Also subjects in G4 vill only participate in Day 1. All other participants will receive pressure lowering drug (Latanoprost) in one eye once daily, until the protocol is repeated at Day 2.

Day 2: The measurements at Day 1 are repeated approximately one week later. The measurements will be made in both eyes, which is why an eye can serve as a control. That way the investigators will have a good opportunity to assess how much of the change the investigators see in the treated eye that may be due to normal variations in OA blood flow and how much depends on the given treatment.

The findings will be compared between the groups and to the normal material in G4. The investigators will be able to see whether, and if so, to what extent, eyes with glaucoma differ from normal eyes in terms of blood flow through OA as compared to the IOP measurements, and different biomechanical parameters of the eye. Thus, determine the pressure dynamics and calculate ocular compliance with the three different groups of research subjects; newly diagnosed glaucoma, ocular hypertension, normal tension glaucoma.",UNKNOWN,,2013-12,2019-09,2019-09,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,SINGLE,DIAGNOSTIC,125,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Latanoprost"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Between measurements on day 1 and day 2, the subjects will receive a drop of latanoprost which is an IOP lowering drug once daily in one eye."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG,latanoprost,0

Participants will perform either cardiovascular training (CT) or resistance training (RT) for 12 weeks, at least two times/week. The assessments will be performed at baseline and after training by an assessor blinded to the participants' group allocation.","Background: Over 100,000 Canadians are currently living with PD. Every year, 6.600 new cases are diagnosed and this number is expected to double by 2031. Most (98%) of those persons experience sleep problems, which can appear even before the onset of the cardinal motor symptoms of the disease, affecting multiple aspects of their QoL. Persons with PD also show alterations in sleep architecture, which have been associated with faster disease progression. Since medications used to reduce sleep problems in PD have potential adverse side effects, exercise has been proposed as a potential non-pharmacological alternative to improve sleep quality and architecture in people with PD. However, the most beneficial type of intervention to improve sleep in this clinical population is still to be determined.

Objective: 1) To conduct a 12-week RCT comparing the effects of CT and RT on both objective and subjective measures of sleep quality and architecture in patients with mild-to-moderate PD; 2) To assess whether, regardless of the type of exercise, positive changes in sleep quality and architecture mediate exercise-induced improvements in cognitive and motor function as well as in different aspects that directly impact on QoL; 3) To explore whether, regardless of the type of exercise used, positive changes in sleep architecture will be associated with improvements in brain plasticity and motor learning.

Design: a single-blinded RCT in which assessments will be performed at baseline (pre) and after (post) training by an assessor blinded to the participants' group allocation.

Outcomes: 1) objective and subjective sleep quality as well as sleep architecture; 2) cognitive and motor function as well as fatigue, psychological functioning, and QoL; 3) motor learning and brain plasticity.

Methods: Changes in objective (i.e. sleep efficiency) and subjective measures of sleep quality will be assessed with actigraphy and the PD sleep scale version 2, respectively. Sleep architecture will be measured with polysomnography. Motor and cognitive function will be assessed with the Unified PD Rating Scale and the Scale for Outcomes in PD-Cognition, respectively. Fatigue, psychosocial functioning and QoL will be assessed with the PD Fatigue Scale, the Scale for Outcomes in PD-Psychosocial and the PD QoL Scale, respectively. Motor learning will be assessed using a visuomotor tracking task; whereas brain plasticity will be measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex.

Expected results: 1) CT will be more effective than RT in improving objective and subjective sleep quality. RT and CT will be equally effective in improving sleep architecture; 2) Improvements in sleep quality and architecture will be associated with enhancements in cognition, motor function and different QoL-related aspects; 3) Positive changes in sleep architecture will mediated increases in brain plasticity and motor learning.

Impact: This will be the first study comparing the effect of CT and RT on sleep quality and architecture and exploring associations with cognitive and motor function as well as aspects that directly impact QoL.

Previous studies have shown that weight loss via lifestyle modifications is associated with a decrease in large artery (aorta) stiffness. However, along with decreases in fat mass, hypocaloric diet reduces muscle mass. Whole body vibration results in similar increases in muscle mass and strength than those observed after resistance exercise and is feasible for special populations such as the obese and the elderly.

The investigators hypothesis is that weight loss via diet combined with whole body vibration training would additively reduce arterial stiffness and blood pressure in obese women. The investigators also hypothesize that the improved arterial function with weight loss would be associated with beneficial changes in the main mechanisms involved in BP regulation.","The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 12 weeks of whole body vibration training (WBVT) and diet on arterial function, autonomic function, and body composition in obese women.

OTHER,NCT01411579,Use of DwI-MR to Predict Chemotherapy Response of Liver Metastases and Hepatocarcinoma,Assessment of Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging to Predict Chemotherapy Outcome in Liver Metastases and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC),"One of the most recent and interesting field of diagnostic imaging is diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DW-MRI). Various studies evaluated the application of DW-MRI to diffuse liver disease and focal liver lesions providing controversial results, probably due to the difficult reproducibility of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements. It is conceivable that a wide inter/intra-individual variability actually exists in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-values, and that each apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-value presents an higher reliability in measuring the temporal changes of water diffusion within the same individual (longitudinal-evaluation), than in characterizing tissues between different patients (transverse-evaluation). For these reasons, some previous studies assessed the application of DW-MRI in predicting the chemotherapy (CHT) outcome in liver metastases. The rationale of these studies was the overt biochemical changes shown by the neoplastic cells after CHT and the sensitivity of DW-MRI in the identification of such changes. The same authors noticed that the metastatic lesions with the lowest ADC-values present also the best outcome after CHT. Moreover, these studies suggest that it could be possible to assess if each single patient will respond (R) or not (NR) to the CHT through liver DW-MRI performed from 3 days to 3 weeks after the beginning of CHT.","In R patients an increase of the mean diameter of the neoplastic cells should be present from the first week of CHT with a consequent reduction of the ADC-value. Then, the ADC-value should increase after 2-3 weeks due to the reduction of the cellular volume and to the increase of the membrane permeability. In NR patients, these biochemical changes should not be present with a consequent constant ADC-value before/after CHT. Our multicentre study will allow the recruitment of a higher number of patients vs. previous studies. Moreover, presently the outcome of CHT in liver metastases is evaluated only after 2-3 cycles of CHT according to the RECIST (Response-Evaluation-Criteria-In-Solid-Tumors) and then merely on a dimensional basis. Anyway, frequently liver metastases in R patients, can not show any significant dimensional change, while they present several biochemical/metabolic changes, not included in the RECIST, but probably detectable by DW-MRI.

The principal objective of the study is the early assessment of CHT outcome in liver metastases and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with liver metastasis will be stratified as R and NR on the basis of the contrast-enhanced CT examination performed 20 days after the beginning of the second cycle of CHT; patients with HCC undergoing therapy with Sorafenib will be stratified as R and NR on the basis of the contrast-enhanced CT examination performed 90 days after the beginning of the therapy. The ADC-values obtained before and after the first CHT cycle will be compared between each patient category to assess the grade of agreement between the dimensional and functional parameters. Moreover, the investigators' aim is to assess whether those liver metastases or HCCs presenting a lower ADC-value before CHT are actually more responsive to CHT in comparison to liver metastases and HCCs presenting a higher ADC-value.

Secondary objectives: to propose some additional functional criteria to the RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST (for HCC) criteria based on water diffusion and biochemical changes of the neoplastic cells. As a further objective it is possible to hypothesize a different response to CHT of the different tumor histotypes detectable from the different ADC changes induced by CHT.

Patient population

Inclusion criteria:

* of age, compliant, patients enrolled for CHT, without major contraindications to the MR examination;
* non-confluent liver metastases, from every primary carcinoma histotype biopsy/surgical-proven, without intralesional necrosis/calcification involving \>30% of their volume;
* multiple confluent hepatocellular carcinomas, histotype biopsy/surgical-proven in prevision of treatment with Sorafenib;
* at least one marker lesion allowing reproducible ADC measurements, i.e. placed at the level of the lower right liver segments;
* detection/enrolment by contrast-enhanced CT before CHT that allow to define the lesion size or the gross parenchymal involvement (if HCC).

Each patient will sign an informed consent, after the procedure will be completely explained.

For the metastasis: three diameter of each marker lesion will be measured, and the mean/minimal/maximal ADC±standard deviation will be quantified by region-of-interests (ROIs) placed within the lesion avoiding lesion margins and the necrotic/intratumoral calcification areas. All measurements will be repeated for three times even at the level of the adjacent liver parenchyma (within 3 cm from the lesion margins, keeping a ROI diameter \>2 cm). Consequently, the absolute values (s/mm2) of ADC, and the ADC percentages vs. the adjacent liver parenchyma measured at the different times will be compared.

For HCC: three diameter of gross parenchymal involvement will be measured, and the mean/minimal/maximal ADC±standard deviation will be quantified by large region-of-interests (ROIs) placed within the liver lobe containing the involvement. All measurements will be repeated for three times even at the level of the adjacent normal liver parenchyma (within 3 cm from the lesion margins, keeping a ROI diameter \>2 cm). Consequently, the absolute values (s/mm2) of ADC, and the ADC percentages vs. the adjacent liver parenchyma measured at the different times will be compared.

Imaging

For metastasis: patients will be scanned by DW-MRI and contrast-enhanced CT before the beginning of CHT (Time 0). The time between the initial MRI and contrast-enhanced CT should not be superior to one week. MRI examination will be repeated within one week (Time 1) and 20 days from the beginning of the first cycle of CHT (Time 2), and 20 days from the beginning of the second cycle of CHT (Time 3).

For HCC: patients will be scanned by DW-MRI and contrast-enhanced CT before the beginning of CHT (Time 0). The time between the initial MRI and contrast-enhanced CT should not be superior to one week. MRI examination will be repeated after 30 days (Time 1), 60 days and 90 days (Time 3) from the beginning of the CHT.

Contrast-enhanced CT will be performed contemporarily or within one week after the last MRI examination.

Contrast-enhanced CT examination will be performed according to an established protocol by using a 16/64-row equipment according to the centre involved, contrast bolus-track technology, slice- thickness reconstruction of 3 mm, before/after ev. injection of iodinated contrast agent (3 mL/s), during arterial/portal phase.

All MR examinations will be carried out using the following 1.5-T units:

* Gyroscan ACS NT Intera Release 12 (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) (Trieste and Florence), gradient strength, 30 mT/m; slew rate, 120 T/m/s; six-channel phased array multicoil;
* Magnetom Avanto (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) (Treviso and Napoli), gradient strength, 45 mT/m; slew rate, 200 T/m/s; 2 phased-array coils with 18 elements. The different MR equipments employed by the different centers will be calibrated by a dedicated phantom.

The phased array multicoil will be adequately positioned to cover the upper abdomen of the subject lying in a supine position, the arms extended over the head to avoid artifacts. Patients, fasting from 4 hours, will be instructed to maintain a constant respiration depth, even with the possibility to use exogenous oxygen delivery to avoid deep respiration. All acquisitions will be obtained by single-shot sequence to obtain immediately/automatically the ADC-values.

The protocol included the following acquisitions:

1. T2-weighted half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) free-breath sequence; transverse/coronal plane; TR/TE, 810/80 ms; echo-train length, 69; slice number, 40; slice thickness, 5 mm; intersection gap, 10%; field of view, 300-420 mm; effective matrix size, 256 x 165; number signal averages (NSA), 1; total acquisition time, 2-3 min;
2. T1-weighted 2D gradient echo in/out phase breath-hold sequence; transverse plane; TR/TE, 231-121/ 14.6-2.3 ms; slice thickness, 5 mm; slice number, 24; intersection gap,10%; flip angle, 80°; sense factor, 1.5; field of view, 300-420 mm; effective matrix size, 256 x 165; NSA, 1; total acquisition time, 18 s;
3. D-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) single-shot free-breath sequences will be acquired on transverse plane with variable EPI factor and the following parameters. Fat suppression will be obtained by spectral pre-saturation inversion recovery. Isotropic motion probing gradients will be applied for each DwI acquisition and for each b-value will be obtained images and corresponding ADC map.

The investigators presently define as R those patients who show a reduction of the liver metastasis or HCC diameter ≥30% on contrast-enhanced CT at three weeks after the beginning of the second CHT cycle; if not, it was considered NR. Changes in tumor size after treatment were calculated by using the formula % Vend =(VB -Vend)/VBx100, where VB was lesion size before treatment (maximum transverse diameter) and Vend was lesion size 20 days after the second administration.

On the basis of the dimensional reduction of liver metastases and parenchymal involvement (for HCC) on contrast-enhanced CT on Time 3 vs. Time 0 scan, each patient will be classified as R or NR according to the RECIST and mRECIST criteria. Afterwards, on the basis of the ADC-values measured during the different MR examinations, the inter/intra-individual ADC-values will be compared to the results of contrast-enhanced CT to assess the relation between reduction of the liver metastasis diameter and:

* increase of the ADC-value on Time 3 (after the end of CHT);
* reduction of the ADC-value on Time 1 (very early assessment);
* increase of the ADC-value on Time 2 (early assessment); and to assess whether the lesions with the highest pre-treatment ADC-value present also the highest dimensional reduction and the highest ADC-value at the end of CHT; In each center each evaluation will be performed three times by two blinded observers (all trained how to place the ROI by an inter-centre conference) to assess the reproducibility of all measurements. The observers who will assess the MR images will be different from the observers assessing the CT images and will not be aware about the size changes after CHT. The investigators will perform data mathematical fitting on multi-b DW-MRI data sets to calculate the true diffusion and the perfusion fraction.

Statistical analysis will employ linear regression analysis to assess the association between the ADC-value changes and the CHT outcome.

The transferability of the results of the present study to the clinical practice will be possible after the achievement of the primary objective, corresponding to the possibility of stratifying patients as R and NR to CHT through DW-MRI just after one week of treatment and/or with the pre-treatment ADC assessment. Nowadays, it is necessary to wait 20-30 days after the end of the second or third CHT cycle to know the individual outcome of CHT. This determines 2-3 months of ineffective therapy with consequent avoidable pain for the patients related to drug administration, and unusable costs. The possibility to know the response of each patient to CHT well in advance will allow avoiding vain drug administration to patients who could attempt a different treatment or drug combinations reducing treatment costs.

The clinical transferability of the present study will be performed after the achievement of one or both the secondary objectives, corresponding to the identification of functional criteria based on water diffusion and biochemical features of the neoplastic cells which can be proposed as additional or alternative criteria to the RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, and to the identification of a different response to CHT of different tumor histotypes. If only one of these objectives will be reached this study will achieve an important result, allowing a more correct assessment of individual response to CHT.",COMPLETED,,2011-02,2013-02,2012-02,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,57,ACTUAL,[],,,1

Specifically, the investigators will generate Cohen's D as the effect size estimate, which is calculated as the difference in the group means divided by the pooled standard deviation. Cohen's D is an established quantitative measure for effect size estimation and informing power analysis for study design.

OTHER,NCT04304079,A Novel Augmented Reality System (ARssist) for the Assistant Surgeon in Robotic Assisted Surgery,A Novel Augmented Reality System (ARssist) for the Assistant Surgeon in Robotic Assisted Surgery: A Pilot Study,"Robotic prostatectomy is a surgery for treating localized prostate cancer. The ARssist system is a novel augmented reality system designed for the assistant surgeon, allowing delivery of augmented reality information via Microsoft HoloLens 2 (a head mount display developed by Microsoft) to better delineate the 3-D operative environment and enable better visualization. To date, there is no prospective study on the clinical performance and utilization of the ARssist system. This study is to evaluate the clinical feasibility and safety of the ARssist system during robotic surgery with the da Vinci Xi system.","The da Vinci robotic surgery system offers advantages such as immersive three-dimensional visualization, intuitive control, and high degree of movement freedom to the chief surgeon. However, major surgery remains a team-based effort. Apart from the chief surgeon who remotely controls the da Vinci system at the console, the success of robotic assisted surgical procedures also relies on the assistant surgeon positioned at the patient side, who provides assistance laparoscopically. Throughout a robotic assisted operation, the patient side surgeon is responsible for tasks such as the exchange of instruments, retraction of tissue to enhance operative fields, manipulation of instruments, etc. Literature has demonstrated that the performance of the assistant surgeon has an effect on the outcomes of robotic surgery such as operative time.

Traditionally the patient side surgeon relies on the monitor mounted on the vision cart to guide his/her movement. The monitor provides real-time relay of the image captured from the endoscope, but does not provide the full three-dimensional stereo endoscopy view unless set up with specialized stereo-vision equipment. The position of the monitor is also often awkward, creating problems such as obstructed views and non-ergonomic positioning of the patient side surgeon to overcome the view obstruction. The complex three-dimensional set-up of endoscope, robotic instruments, and hand-held instruments inside the patient body could prove difficult to imagine from the patient side surgeon's perspective, and guesswork could be involved during transfer of instruments/objects towards the operative field as the hand-held instruments are often out of the visualized field of the endoscope.

Augmented reality (AR) technology delivered via optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD) could potentially be the solution to the aforementioned issues. OST-HMD, such as Microsoft HoloLens, can superimpose computer graphics on top of real-world view through optical combiners. The clinical application of such a technology has been gaining interest in the surgical community, with preliminary study demonstrating feasibility of AR technology in ureteroscopic procedures.

The ARssist system is a novel AR system designed for the patient side surgeon in robotic assisted surgeries. It integrates the da Vinci surgical system and Microsoft HoloLens, and provides valuable AR information to the patient side surgeon including (i) three-dimensional real-time rendering of the endoscope, robotic instruments, and hand-held instruments within the patient body, and (ii) real-time stereo endoscopy that is configurable for the assistant surgeon's preferred hand-eye coordination. The ARssist system would in theory grant the patient side surgeon improved orientation and navigation of hand-held laparoscopic instruments, thus improving their laparoscopic performance and the performance of the surgery as a whole.

OTHER,NCT03838679,Imaging of the Angiofibrotic Switch in Neovascular AMD,Multimodal Imaging of Subretinal Fibrosis in Neovascular AMD,"The content of this research project is to identify the angiofibrotic switch, the transition from angiogenesis to fibrosis, in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) longitudinally. Despite optimal treatment about 50% of eyes with nAMD develop fibrosis within 2 years, causing irreversible damage to the retina and functional loss. Objective measurement of fibrosis, however, is challenging, since clinical staging is subjective and current imaging modalities such as color fundus photography (CFP), fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) often do not allow clear delineation. Novel imaging modalities such as polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA) and adaptive-optics OCT (AO-OCT) offer identification of fibrous components and microvasculature of fibrotic lesions non-invasively with highest precision and shall thus be used in this study.

Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize to detect and quantify subclinical (i.e. not detectable on dilated fundus examination) areas of fibrosis using PS-OCT and determine the rate and exact location within the neovascular lesion. Furthermore, the investigators expect neuroretinal and microvascular changes, which will be assessed by AO-OCT and OCTA.

Methods: Eighty eyes of 80 patients with chronic nAMD will be included and examined cross- sectionally to evaluate the accuracy of PS-OCT to detect and quantify fibrosis in comparison to gold standard imaging modalities. In addition, OCTA and AO-OCT will be performed to analyze the relationship between fibrous, neovascular and neuroretinal structures. Furthermore, forty eyes of 40 participants with treatment-naïve nAMD will be included and followed over 12 months with predefined follow-up intervals. Novel non-invasive imaging will be applied to objectively determine the exact time and extent of the angiofibrotic switch in nAMD during state-of-the- art therapy. This approach has not been done before and is clinically relevant for multiple reasons: Firstly, only little is known about the development of fibrosis in AMD during therapy. Secondly, the clinical diagnosis of subretinal fibrosis is subjective and does not allow reliable quantification. Thirdly, current gold standard imaging modalities (i.e. CFP and FA) for detection of fibrosis involve invasive and time-consuming procedures and do not allow three-dimensional analysis. Finally, our study may identify objective endpoints for future interventional trials.","Research questions/hypotheses: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of legal blindness among elderly patients in industrialized countries. The main reason for severe and irreversible visual impairment among these patients is subretinal fibrosis (SF). Large-scale interventional trials (e.g. CATT) have shown that half of all eyes affected by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) develop clinically visible fibrotic scarring over two years despite optimal treatment, causing irreversible retinal damage and functional loss. Thus, prevention of fibrosis in AMD is currently the focus of researchers worldwide. Clearly defined end points for interventional trials, however, are lacking because detection and quantification of SF is challenging. Clinical staging of SF is subjective and current gold standard imaging modalities such as color fundus photography (CFP), fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), even in concert, do not allow a distinct and early delineation of SF. Novel imaging modalities such as polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA) and adaptive optics (AO)-OCT are promising means to objectively detect SF and provide detailed insights into the biology of the microvascular and neurosensory compartments. Our group recently demonstrated that PS-OCT offers automated identification and quantification of SF in AMD based on tissue-specific contrast. Aim of the proposed research project is to detect and characterize the angiofibrotic switch, i.e. the transition from active and reversible neovascularization to irreversible fibrosis, in neovascular AMD under anti-VEGF treatment. We hypothesize to detect the initiating events of fibrotic conversion including even subclinical stages of fibrosis by non-invasive PS-OCT and identify the association with fibrovascular and retinal changes by OCTA and AO-OCT, respectively.

Scientific/scholarly innovation/originality of the project: The combination of PS-OCT, OCTA and AO-OCTA to non-invasively detect pathognomonic features of fibrovascular conversion is a novel and unprecedented approach towards objective visualization and quantification of disease pathomechanisms. Outcomes of this study may provide clearly defined morphological endpoints for future interventional trials.

Methods: Eighty eyes of 80 patients with chronic nAMD will be included and examined cross-sectionally to evaluate the accuracy of PS-OCT to detect and quantify fibrosis in comparison to gold standard imaging. In addition, OCTA and AO-OCT will be performed to analyze the relationship between fibrous, vascular and retinal structures. Furthermore, forty eyes of 40 participants with treatment-naïve nAMD will be included in a prospective study and followed for one year under treatment.

OTHER,NCT06948279,Immediate vs. Elective Endoscopic Removal of Large CBD Stones in High-Risk Elderly Patients,Immediate Versus Elective Endoscopic Removal of Large Common Bile Duct Stones in High-Risk Elderly Patients,"The goal of this clinical trial is to compare two different approaches for removing large or multiple stones from the common bile duct in older adults with chronic diseases. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Is it better to remove the stones immediately during the first endoscopic procedure? Or is it safer and more effective to place a temporary plastic stent first and remove the stones later?

Researchers will compare these two approaches to see which one leads to better stone clearance and fewer complications.

Participants will:

Undergo an endoscopic procedure (ERCP) to treat their bile duct stones. Be randomly assigned to either have immediate stone removal or have a stent placed first, with stone removal scheduled 8-12 weeks later.

Attend follow-up visits to monitor their recovery and check for complications.

This study is being conducted at the National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, Egypt.","This study was designed to evaluate two different endoscopic treatment strategies for managing large or multiple common bile duct (CBD) stones in elderly patients considered high-risk due to age and comorbid conditions. The research was conducted at the National Liver Institute, Menoufia University in Egypt, a tertiary care center with a high volume of hepatobiliary cases and extensive expertise in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Study Design and Population This was a prospective, randomized, comparative clinical trial conducted between February 2022 and September 2024. A total of 400 patients aged 65 years or older, with a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) ≥ 3 and radiologically confirmed large or multiple CBD stones, were enrolled. Large stones were defined as those with a diameter ≥15 mm; multiple stones were defined as three or more stones, each measuring ≥10 mm. Stone size and number were confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups:

Group A (Stent-first approach): Underwent initial biliary stenting followed by elective stone extraction 8-12 weeks later.

Group B (Stone retrieval-first approach): Underwent immediate endoscopic stone removal during the index ERCP.

Study Procedures and Intervention Details All participants underwent a standardized baseline assessment, including a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, laboratory testing (e.g., liver enzymes, complete blood count, coagulation profile), and imaging studies. Randomization was computer-generated and concealed from the enrolling clinical team to minimize selection bias. While blinding of patients and proceduralists was not feasible due to the nature of the interventions, outcome assessments-including imaging reviews and complication monitoring-were conducted by independent investigators who were blinded to treatment allocation.

ERCP procedures were performed using a side-viewing endoscope (Pentax ED-3490TK). In all patients, endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) was performed, and selective CBD cannulation was achieved using standard or alternative techniques when necessary. In Group A, a 10 Fr, 10 cm plastic biliary stent was placed, with a follow-up ERCP scheduled after 8-12 weeks for elective stone removal. In Group B, stone extraction was attempted during the index ERCP using a balloon, Dormia basket, or mechanical lithotripsy. A stent was placed only if stone extraction was incomplete.

Calculation of Stone Burden CBD stone dimensions were measured from radiographic images, with adjustments for magnification using the endoscope diameter as a reference. The total stone burden, or stone index, was calculated as the sum of all stone diameters in centimeters. Two independent radiologists reviewed and averaged the measurements to ensure accuracy and objectivity.

Assessments and Follow-Up The primary outcome was the rate of complete stone clearance. Patients were monitored throughout hospitalization and followed at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after discharge. Follow-up evaluations included clinical examinations, laboratory testing (e.g., liver function, inflammatory markers), and repeat imaging studies. Complications were recorded in real time, and their severity was graded using established clinical criteria.

Statistical Analysis Plan The sample size was calculated to detect a 15% difference in stone clearance rates between the two groups, with 80% power and a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Continuous variables were assessed using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test, depending on the distribution. Statistical significance was defined as P \< 0.05.

Ethical Considerations This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Liver Institute (Approval No. 00659) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

OTHER,NCT05671679,Supporting Meal Management in Type 1 Diabetes,Supporting Meal Management in Type 1 Diabetes,"Carbohydrate count marks the cornerstone of Type 1 Diabetes management. Eventhough it is a crucial task, it is burdensome and prone to error. Therefore, the investigators want to explore the effect that SNAQ, a food analyser app would have in glycaemic control by facilitating the task of carbohydrate estimation.","Diet and physical activity are critically important in the lifestyle of people with type 1 diabetes. When diagnosed with the disease, people with type 1 diabetes are educated about nutritional goals and how to estimate nutritional content of food. Carbohydrates are the food component with the greatest impact on blood glucose levels and typical sources in the diet include starches, some vegetables, fruits, dairy products and sugars . Thus, people with type 1 diabetes are primarily being trained to estimate the carbohydrate content of food, a task that is also referred to as carbohydrate counting. Different methods can be used to count carbohydrate in food and drink. These include reading the nutritional labels, consulting reference books or websites, carrying a database on a personal digital assistant or using exchange tables which provides the carbohydrate content for typical serving sizes (e.g. 1 slice of bread). While nutritional information can be accessed through the above mentioned methods, the quantification of the portion sizes (if not indicated on the food package) requires the additional use of scale or measuring vessel. Given the required effort and time investment related to these methods, the great majority of people with type 1 diabetes count carbohydrates by visual estimation and experience. As a consequence, people's estimate often deviate substantially from ground truth values and average carbohydrate estimation errors reported in the literature are 20% or higher.

Of note, more than 60% of individuals with diabetes report having trouble with carbohydrate counting, despite their awareness on its importance . Even in patients who are confident in applying carbohydrate counting, the daily task is perceived as major burden of diabetes self-management.

Since carbohydrate counting is particularly demanding when eating fresh, non-packaged foods, a concerning trend towards unhealthy dietary choices with preference of prepackaged foods (with accessible nutrition facts) over whole foods is increasingly observed in people with type 1 diabetes. This is paralleled by an increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in the type 1 diabetes population.

Thus, even with the latest hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery technologies, adequate nutrition knowledge remains a cornerstone for satisfactory glucose control, metabolic health, and prevention of diabetes-related complications and comorbidities.

With the development of new technologies embedded in modern smartphones (i.e. depth sensors), image-based methods to support food assessment have become widely available. Of particular use is the employment of well-established computer vision methodologies to estimate the quantity of food. When combined with food-recognition technologies and information from nutritional databases, a proposition of the nutritional content (e.g. carbohydrates, fat, proteins, fibres) can be made to the user on the basis of captured images and obviates the need for error prone visual estimations and mental calculations. Several such applications have become available and can support monitoring the diet as part of lifestyle management.

Insights from a recent online survey suggest that a high proportion of people with type 1 diabetes believe that such new technologies for meal management could facilitate their daily self-management and would be interested in using such technology. Moreover, according to a recent study, such digital tools may promote diabetes education and food literacy which may particularly benefit those with a lower education level and with a history of depression.

Amongst several options (e.g. Foodvisor, Calorie-Mamma, Lifesum) for image-based food tracking and analysis, SNAQ is one of the most commonly used app in people with type 1 diabetes. Up to date, more than 40000 users have downloaded the SNAQ app in their phones, of which 2,500 are living in Switzerland.

The investigators have previously demonstrated that the system estimates the macronutrient content of real meals with satisfying accuracy.

However, evidence with regards to the effect of the food analysis on daily self-management of people with type 1 diabetes (e.g. glucose control, meal patterns, perceived benefits) is currently lacking. The investigators therefore aim to address these aspects in a randomized-controlled study contrasting the use of the SNAQ app with people's traditional meal management techniques.",COMPLETED,,2023-03-27,2024-05-08,2024-05-08,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,PREVENTION,44,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""SNAQ app"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""SNAQ is a smartphone food analysis app that estimates the macronutrient content of a meal, based on a single image.

Then, the total macronutrient and energy content of the meal is determined based on the estimated volume and information from a nutritional database. Of note, the application also allows for assessing nutritional content of packaged foods by means of a barcode scanning function.

INDUSTRY,NCT05201079,Primary or Recurrent Clostridioides Difficile Infection Treatment With Capsules of Lyophilised Faecal Microbiota vs Fidaxomicin,"A Randomised, Controlled, Open-label Phase III Clinical Trial in Patients With Primary or Recurrent Clostridioides Difficile (CD) Infection, to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Capsules of Lyophilised Faecal Microbiota vs Fidaxomicin.","Patients with microbiota alterations developed after being exposed to antibiotics are especially susceptible to Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI). The incidence and severity of CDI has increased in recent years and CDI recurrences (r-CDI) due to the appearance of new episodes in patients with a previous cured CDI, represent a serious and complex clinical issue. Although antibiotics are the recommended therapy for the first episode of CDI, treatment with oral vancomycin and/or metronidazole often results in significant treatment failure. In addition, the treatment of r-CDI is not adequately standardized, and although the most widely used treatment is the administration of fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab, its efficacy in patients who already have r-CDI is not proven. In the late years, Fecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT) has emerged as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment to manage CDI with multiple recurrences and recent clinical trials have evaluated its potential efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with primary CD infection.

The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the MBK-01 medication, consisting of heterologous lyophilized fecal microbiota capsules coming from healthy donors in comparison to the treatment with fidaxomicin, in 92 patients with primary or r-CDI.","This is a Phase III, multicenter, controlled and open label clinical trial in which patients who suffered an episode of Clostridioides difficile infection (either the first episode or subsequent recurrences) will be randomly assigned (1:1) to one of the following arms:

* Fidaxomicin
* MBK-01 (heterologous lyophilized fecal microbiota)

Objective: To assess the efficacy of FMT with capsules of lyophilized fecal microbiota (MBK-01), compared to the control (fidaxomicin) at 8 weeks after the start of the treatment. Also, assess the safety of MBK-01 and the quality of life of patients participating in the study.

Follow up: participants will return for clinic visits at 72 hours, week 3 and week 8 after the start of the treatment, and will receive follow-up phone calls at month 3 and month 6 after the start of the treatment. Stool samples will be collected from participants for further studies at time 0 and week 8 after the start of the treatment. Study Outcomes are detailed in the specific section of this website.

Rationale: The transferred microbiota restores the recipient's intestinal microbiota by reintroducing bacterial taxa that were absent or in low proportion in the recipient before the FMT. This supports the expansion of the recipient's own commensal microbiota and re-establishing a microbiota community with a high biodiversity.

Donors: All donors are screened to ensure they meet the strict requirements necessary to maintain the safety of the MBK-01.

Justification: The treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) with antibiotics is usually effective for acute symptoms, but after the initial treatment, the probability of recurrence at 8 weeks ranges from 10-20 % of cases, and once a patient has a recurrence, the probability of further recurrences increases up to 40-65 %. In recent years, Fecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT) has emerged as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment to manage CDI with multiple recurrences and recent clinical trials have evaluated its potential efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with primary CD infection. Although antibiotics are the recommended therapy for the first episode of CDI, treatment with oral vancomycin and/or metronidazole often results in significant treatment failure, with recurrences occurring in up to 30-40% of patients. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment does not correct deficiencies in the intestinal microbiota that facilitate CD infection and is associated with the risk of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Moreover, the treatment of recurrences is not adequately standardized. In recent years, although the most widely used alternatives have been fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab, their efficacy in patients who already suffer from r-CDI is not proven. The administration of the FMT through oral capsules, although it is not standardized, has proven to be effective in the restoration of intestinal microbiota of patients with r-CDI. In addition, the use of lyophilized formulas facilitates the concentration of bacteria and further optimizes the donors' sample and reduces the amount of capsules that the patient has to ingest.",COMPLETED,,2021-10-29,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,93,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""MBK-01"", ""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""description"": ""A single dose of 4 capsules of MBK-01 (heterologous lyophilized fecal microbiota coming from healthy donors) orally."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Fidaxomicin"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Oral administration of 200mg/12 hours of fidaxomicin for 10 days."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BIOLOGICAL;DRUG,mbk-01;fidaxomicin,1

- Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a functional imaging technique that can be uses light to study brain function while allowing for movement. To look at blood flow in the brain, NIRS uses a low-power light source with detectors that see how the light changes as it passes through brain tissue. Brain blood flow can indicate which parts of the brain are active during different tasks. Researchers want to study children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and will use NIRS to compare the blood flow in the brain of children with ADHD and ASD with that of typically developing children.

Objectives:

* To see how well NIRS can detect changes in brain blood flow during tests of thinking and memory in children.
* To compare blood flow in the brains of typically developing children and those with ADHD or ASD.

Eligibility:

- Children between 4 and 8 years of age with ASD, ADHD, or children with no psychiatric diagnoses.

Design:

* Participants will be screened for eligibility. Those who are taking stimulant medication for ADHD or ASD will need to stop taking it for 3 days before the study visit.
* After participating in a screening assessment, all participants will have one study visit. At this visit, they will have be asked to complete two tasks during a NIRS scan. For both tasks, they will react to images on a computer screen. This visit will last about 2 hours.
* This is a testing study only. No blood or other samples will be needed for this study.","Objective: to test whether Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to monitor cognitive brain function and detect markers for differentiation of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
