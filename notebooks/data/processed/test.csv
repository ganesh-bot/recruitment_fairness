It has also been related to cardiovascular disease.

The objective of this trial is to evaluate the clinical and metabolic efficacy of metformin plus life style modifications in women with polycystic ovary syndrome compared with life style modifications and placebo","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and heterogeneous disorder of women in reproductive age. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. Several studies in diverse populations estimate it's prevalence at 5-10%. Women present, in a high percentage of cases, with obesity, hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities and infertility. Although the exact physiopathology of PCOS remains unknown, several studies tend to point to insulinoresistance (IR) as the cause of the syndrome. IR is present in 60 to 70% of patients independently of obesity. Compensatory hyperinsulinism has a pivotal role in the physiopathogenesis of PCOS. In vitro, insulin stimulates androgen synthesis in thecal cells and decrease sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis in the liver, increasing free androgen availability.

Due to the high prevalence of IR, PCOS shares components of metabolic syndrome: abdominal obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational and type 2 diabetes, abnormalities in lipid profile, blood hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and probably cardiovascular disease.

In the past, PCOS treatment was focus on ovulation induction for infertility, oral contraceptives for irregular bleeding, and androgens antagonists for hirsutism or acne. In later years insulin sensitizing agents have been used to reduce hyperinsulinemia, improve ovary function and associated metabolic abnormalities. Metformin (MTF), a biguanide, usually used in obese patients with type 2 diabetes,inhibits glucose hepatic production,decreases insulin secretion and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity.

Some studies have reported an improvement in insulin sensitivity associated with reduction of hyperandrogenism and improvements in reproductive abnormalities with MTF. On the other hand, other authors failed to observe those changes. However, an off label indication for it usage in PCOS for FDA and the lack of large controlled trials, MTF indication to treat PCOS has grown dramatically in later years.

In obese women with PCOS, weight loss effectively ameliorates hyperandrogenism and metabolic disorders by improving insulin resistance.

Some trials have suggested that those effects could be improved with insulin sensitizing agents without changes in body weigh.

Stefano Colagrande,OTHER,NCT01411579,Use of DwI-MR to Predict Chemotherapy Response of Liver Metastases and Hepatocarcinoma,Assessment of Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging to Predict Chemotherapy Outcome in Liver Metastases and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC),"One of the most recent and interesting field of diagnostic imaging is diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DW-MRI). Various studies evaluated the application of DW-MRI to diffuse liver disease and focal liver lesions providing controversial results, probably due to the difficult reproducibility of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements. It is conceivable that a wide inter/intra-individual variability actually exists in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-values, and that each apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-value presents an higher reliability in measuring the temporal changes of water diffusion within the same individual (longitudinal-evaluation), than in characterizing tissues between different patients (transverse-evaluation). For these reasons, some previous studies assessed the application of DW-MRI in predicting the chemotherapy (CHT) outcome in liver metastases. The rationale of these studies was the overt biochemical changes shown by the neoplastic cells after CHT and the sensitivity of DW-MRI in the identification of such changes. The same authors noticed that the metastatic lesions with the lowest ADC-values present also the best outcome after CHT. Moreover, these studies suggest that it could be possible to assess if each single patient will respond (R) or not (NR) to the CHT through liver DW-MRI performed from 3 days to 3 weeks after the beginning of CHT.","In R patients an increase of the mean diameter of the neoplastic cells should be present from the first week of CHT with a consequent reduction of the ADC-value. Then, the ADC-value should increase after 2-3 weeks due to the reduction of the cellular volume and to the increase of the membrane permeability. In NR patients, these biochemical changes should not be present with a consequent constant ADC-value before/after CHT. Our multicentre study will allow the recruitment of a higher number of patients vs. previous studies. Moreover, presently the outcome of CHT in liver metastases is evaluated only after 2-3 cycles of CHT according to the RECIST (Response-Evaluation-Criteria-In-Solid-Tumors) and then merely on a dimensional basis. Anyway, frequently liver metastases in R patients, can not show any significant dimensional change, while they present several biochemical/metabolic changes, not included in the RECIST, but probably detectable by DW-MRI.

The principal objective of the study is the early assessment of CHT outcome in liver metastases and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with liver metastasis will be stratified as R and NR on the basis of the contrast-enhanced CT examination performed 20 days after the beginning of the second cycle of CHT; patients with HCC undergoing therapy with Sorafenib will be stratified as R and NR on the basis of the contrast-enhanced CT examination performed 90 days after the beginning of the therapy. The ADC-values obtained before and after the first CHT cycle will be compared between each patient category to assess the grade of agreement between the dimensional and functional parameters. Moreover, the investigators' aim is to assess whether those liver metastases or HCCs presenting a lower ADC-value before CHT are actually more responsive to CHT in comparison to liver metastases and HCCs presenting a higher ADC-value.

Secondary objectives: to propose some additional functional criteria to the RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST (for HCC) criteria based on water diffusion and biochemical changes of the neoplastic cells. As a further objective it is possible to hypothesize a different response to CHT of the different tumor histotypes detectable from the different ADC changes induced by CHT.

Patient population

Inclusion criteria:

* of age, compliant, patients enrolled for CHT, without major contraindications to the MR examination;
* non-confluent liver metastases, from every primary carcinoma histotype biopsy/surgical-proven, without intralesional necrosis/calcification involving \>30% of their volume;
* multiple confluent hepatocellular carcinomas, histotype biopsy/surgical-proven in prevision of treatment with Sorafenib;
* at least one marker lesion allowing reproducible ADC measurements, i.e. placed at the level of the lower right liver segments;
* detection/enrolment by contrast-enhanced CT before CHT that allow to define the lesion size or the gross parenchymal involvement (if HCC).

Each patient will sign an informed consent, after the procedure will be completely explained.

For the metastasis: three diameter of each marker lesion will be measured, and the mean/minimal/maximal ADC±standard deviation will be quantified by region-of-interests (ROIs) placed within the lesion avoiding lesion margins and the necrotic/intratumoral calcification areas. All measurements will be repeated for three times even at the level of the adjacent liver parenchyma (within 3 cm from the lesion margins, keeping a ROI diameter \>2 cm). Consequently, the absolute values (s/mm2) of ADC, and the ADC percentages vs. the adjacent liver parenchyma measured at the different times will be compared.

For HCC: three diameter of gross parenchymal involvement will be measured, and the mean/minimal/maximal ADC±standard deviation will be quantified by large region-of-interests (ROIs) placed within the liver lobe containing the involvement. All measurements will be repeated for three times even at the level of the adjacent normal liver parenchyma (within 3 cm from the lesion margins, keeping a ROI diameter \>2 cm). Consequently, the absolute values (s/mm2) of ADC, and the ADC percentages vs. the adjacent liver parenchyma measured at the different times will be compared.

Imaging

For metastasis: patients will be scanned by DW-MRI and contrast-enhanced CT before the beginning of CHT (Time 0). The time between the initial MRI and contrast-enhanced CT should not be superior to one week. MRI examination will be repeated within one week (Time 1) and 20 days from the beginning of the first cycle of CHT (Time 2), and 20 days from the beginning of the second cycle of CHT (Time 3).

For HCC: patients will be scanned by DW-MRI and contrast-enhanced CT before the beginning of CHT (Time 0). The time between the initial MRI and contrast-enhanced CT should not be superior to one week. MRI examination will be repeated after 30 days (Time 1), 60 days and 90 days (Time 3) from the beginning of the CHT.

Contrast-enhanced CT will be performed contemporarily or within one week after the last MRI examination.

Contrast-enhanced CT examination will be performed according to an established protocol by using a 16/64-row equipment according to the centre involved, contrast bolus-track technology, slice- thickness reconstruction of 3 mm, before/after ev. injection of iodinated contrast agent (3 mL/s), during arterial/portal phase.

All MR examinations will be carried out using the following 1.5-T units:

* Gyroscan ACS NT Intera Release 12 (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) (Trieste and Florence), gradient strength, 30 mT/m; slew rate, 120 T/m/s; six-channel phased array multicoil;
* Magnetom Avanto (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) (Treviso and Napoli), gradient strength, 45 mT/m; slew rate, 200 T/m/s; 2 phased-array coils with 18 elements. The different MR equipments employed by the different centers will be calibrated by a dedicated phantom.

The phased array multicoil will be adequately positioned to cover the upper abdomen of the subject lying in a supine position, the arms extended over the head to avoid artifacts. Patients, fasting from 4 hours, will be instructed to maintain a constant respiration depth, even with the possibility to use exogenous oxygen delivery to avoid deep respiration. All acquisitions will be obtained by single-shot sequence to obtain immediately/automatically the ADC-values.

The protocol included the following acquisitions:

1. T2-weighted half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) free-breath sequence; transverse/coronal plane; TR/TE, 810/80 ms; echo-train length, 69; slice number, 40; slice thickness, 5 mm; intersection gap, 10%; field of view, 300-420 mm; effective matrix size, 256 x 165; number signal averages (NSA), 1; total acquisition time, 2-3 min;
2. T1-weighted 2D gradient echo in/out phase breath-hold sequence; transverse plane; TR/TE, 231-121/ 14.6-2.3 ms; slice thickness, 5 mm; slice number, 24; intersection gap,10%; flip angle, 80°; sense factor, 1.5; field of view, 300-420 mm; effective matrix size, 256 x 165; NSA, 1; total acquisition time, 18 s;
3. D-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) single-shot free-breath sequences will be acquired on transverse plane with variable EPI factor and the following parameters. Fat suppression will be obtained by spectral pre-saturation inversion recovery. Isotropic motion probing gradients will be applied for each DwI acquisition and for each b-value will be obtained images and corresponding ADC map.

The investigators presently define as R those patients who show a reduction of the liver metastasis or HCC diameter ≥30% on contrast-enhanced CT at three weeks after the beginning of the second CHT cycle; if not, it was considered NR. Changes in tumor size after treatment were calculated by using the formula % Vend =(VB -Vend)/VBx100, where VB was lesion size before treatment (maximum transverse diameter) and Vend was lesion size 20 days after the second administration.

On the basis of the dimensional reduction of liver metastases and parenchymal involvement (for HCC) on contrast-enhanced CT on Time 3 vs. Time 0 scan, each patient will be classified as R or NR according to the RECIST and mRECIST criteria. Afterwards, on the basis of the ADC-values measured during the different MR examinations, the inter/intra-individual ADC-values will be compared to the results of contrast-enhanced CT to assess the relation between reduction of the liver metastasis diameter and:

* increase of the ADC-value on Time 3 (after the end of CHT);
* reduction of the ADC-value on Time 1 (very early assessment);
* increase of the ADC-value on Time 2 (early assessment); and to assess whether the lesions with the highest pre-treatment ADC-value present also the highest dimensional reduction and the highest ADC-value at the end of CHT; In each center each evaluation will be performed three times by two blinded observers (all trained how to place the ROI by an inter-centre conference) to assess the reproducibility of all measurements. The observers who will assess the MR images will be different from the observers assessing the CT images and will not be aware about the size changes after CHT. The investigators will perform data mathematical fitting on multi-b DW-MRI data sets to calculate the true diffusion and the perfusion fraction.

Statistical analysis will employ linear regression analysis to assess the association between the ADC-value changes and the CHT outcome.

The transferability of the results of the present study to the clinical practice will be possible after the achievement of the primary objective, corresponding to the possibility of stratifying patients as R and NR to CHT through DW-MRI just after one week of treatment and/or with the pre-treatment ADC assessment. Nowadays, it is necessary to wait 20-30 days after the end of the second or third CHT cycle to know the individual outcome of CHT. This determines 2-3 months of ineffective therapy with consequent avoidable pain for the patients related to drug administration, and unusable costs. The possibility to know the response of each patient to CHT well in advance will allow avoiding vain drug administration to patients who could attempt a different treatment or drug combinations reducing treatment costs.

The clinical transferability of the present study will be performed after the achievement of one or both the secondary objectives, corresponding to the identification of functional criteria based on water diffusion and biochemical features of the neoplastic cells which can be proposed as additional or alternative criteria to the RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST, and to the identification of a different response to CHT of different tumor histotypes. If only one of these objectives will be reached this study will achieve an important result, allowing a more correct assessment of individual response to CHT.","Inclusion criteria:

Obesity and MetS are commonly associated with an inflammatory status. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of echocardiographically measured epicardial fat thickness (EFT) and inflammation, on the basis of c-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with MetS and its components in people with obesity.

A total of 104 patients with body mass index (BMI)≥30 kg/m² were enrolled to the study. In all participants, EFT was measured with transthoracic echocardiography at end-systole. The patients were then classified into two groups according to whether they had MetS or not. EFT, clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between the two groups","Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a kind of VAT, between the surface of the myocardium and the epicardium. It can easily be measured by standard two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. EAT serves as an endocrin organ that secretes hormones, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Previous data suggests that EAT can play an active role in the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Previous studies have investigated the relationship between EAT/inflammatory markers and MetS/MetS components. However, there was lack of enough evidence regarding this relationship in people with obesity with or without MetS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of echocardiographically measured EAT and inflammation, on the basis of c-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), as simple and reliable indicators of inflammation, with MetS and its components in people with obesity who have similar body mass index (BMI) values. In this cross-sectional study, 104 consecutive patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 who presented to the 'Obesity Solution Center 'of Antalya Research and Training Hospital were included .

This study is designed to evaluate the adherence to extended deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis (DVT) with the direct oral anticoagulant apixaban on the background of historical data from the investigator's center on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) substandard adherence in the same setting.","All guidelines have embraced the concept of extended DVT prophylaxis after major abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer, but the recommendation is consistently to use LMWH, which is more complicated than orally available prophylaxis, more expensive and has poor adherence.

The patients will be identified in the pre-operative admission or in post-operative orders as potentially eligible for extended prophylaxis. On the day of discharge a research assistant or a research nurse will approach the patient, provide information about the study and obtain written consent if the patient fulfills the eligibility criteria.

University of British Columbia,OTHER,NCT03972579,Behavioral Profile Matching: A Precision Medicine Approach to Concussion Rehabilitation,Behavioral Profile Matching: A Precision Medicine Approach to Concussion Rehabilitation,"At least 1 in 5 people who sustain a concussion will have persistent symptoms and difficulties with daily activities. The researchers have identified two unhelpful coping styles following a concussion - avoidance and endurance. Individuals who engage in avoidance behavior may benefit from a different type of treatment than those who engage in endurance behavior. The researchers will evaluate whether assigning individuals to a specific psychologically-informed treatment tailored to their coping style is practical, acceptable, and beneficial for their recovery.","Psychosocial factors are known to affect recovery from concussion, but are not sufficiently taken into account by current treatment approaches. Distinct behavioral profiles after concussion have emerged in our research: (1) avoidance, where individuals perceive activity as overly dangerous and take care to avoid overexertion, and (2) endurance, where individuals persist with high levels of activity despite worse symptoms until they ""crash,"" requiring recuperative rest. The researchers hypothesize that patients with these behavioral profiles likely benefit from different treatment approaches. The next step in our research program is to evaluate the feasibility and potential impact of tailoring therapies based on an Avoidance-Endurance Model adapted from the chronic pain literature.

The proposed project aims to evaluate whether matching patients with concussion to tailored therapies based on their behavioral profile (avoidance vs endurance) is feasible. A secondary aim is to test our hypothesis that participants receiving the intervention matched to their behavioral profile will have less post-treatment disability than mismatched participants.

In a pilot double-blind (patient, assessor) RCT with 1:1 allocation stratified by behavioral profile (avoidance vs. endurance), 64 adults with persistent symptoms after concussion will complete an initial evaluation, an activity diary over the following week, and then be randomized to receive an interdisciplinary treatment package tailored to avoidance or endurance profiles.

In brief, the program designed for avoidance will involve graded exposure to cognitively demanding activity (e.g., mental math exercises), physical exertion (e.g., treadmill jogging), and sensory stimulation (e.g., scenes with visual motion). The focus of the endurance program will be pacing, i.e., shifting from symptom-contingent to time-contingent behavior. A blinded assessor will administer outcome measures 12 weeks after enrollment. Feasibility criteria include acceptability of randomization and treatment tolerability, fidelity, and adherence.

Proposed changes to ""profile matching"" study due to COVID-19 pandemic (March 30, 2020)

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be no new enrollments as of March 30, 2020. The study will continue to be advertised at concussion clinic group education sessions, which are now being held virtually, but inform prospective participants that enrollment will be postponed by at least one month. Interested patients will be added to a waitlist for screening when the study resumes enrollment (once COVID-19 social distancing restrictions are lifted and non-essential business/services are resumed).

For participants who have expressed interest in the study and/or have already been screened, but have not completed their baseline assessment: Defer baseline assessment. Inform the participant that the study will resume enrolling when COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted. They will keep their place on a study waitlist. Patients who have been screened will need to be re-screened when enrollment resumes.

For participants who have completed their baseline assessment or are already active in treatment: Continue treatment per protocol. However, participants who have completed no more than 25% of treatment (4 of 16 sessions) should be offered the option of a temporary stoppage for at least one month (i.e., the target of completing all 16 sessions within 10 weeks can be dropped). If the therapists believe that treatment progress is being significantly impeded by COVID-19 restrictions, they may suggest a stoppage. The final decision about stoppage should be made by the participant. If they prefer a stoppage, the therapists should contact the participant in one month to decide whether to resume treatment or delay by another month. Any stoppages should be communicated to the study coordinator.

For participants who completed treatment, or at least 75% of their treatment (12 of 16 sessions), by March 13, 2020 but did not complete their outcome assessment until after that date: Complete the outcome assessment per protocol, but add one question immediately following the WHODAS. Introduce the question as follows:

""These questions were about how much difficulty you had with various activities due to your health conditions over the past month. In other words, I asked you focus on difficulties caused by your concussion and/or other health conditions. However, the investigators recognize that it might be hard to ignore circumstances other than your health conditions when answering these questions."" Ask: ""To what extent were your answers to these questions affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?"" If they ask what ""affected by the COVID-19 pandemic"" means, the research assistant may provide examples: ""Such as all of sudden being laid off or asked to work overtime, or not being able to go out because of social distancing policies."" Provide responses: 0=minimally or not at all, 1=somewhat, 2=quite a bit, 3=very much or entirely.

Confirm their response by asking ""So, were it not for the COVID-19 pandemic, would you have answered these questions ___________ differently?"" Please also record (free text) notes if participants provide explanations or reasons. Note that this additional question is being asked only for the primary study outcome (WHODAS). This question will be removed from the protocol one month after COVID-19 social distancing restrictions are lifted and non-essential business/services are resumed.

Changes to the statistical analysis plan:

Participants whose treatment progress and/or outcome assessment was likely substantially impacted by COVID-19 will be excluded from the primary analysis. Participants who treatment progress and/or outcome assessment was possibly mildly impacted, but not likely substantially impacted, by COVID-19 will be included in the primary analysis. This will be operationalized according to the Table 1 below.

The condition can be classified as an autoimmune disorder.Although the exact cause of this condition is unknown, some potential risk factors should be taken into account, such as systemic disorders, psychogenic diseases, dental restorations, and certain medications.

The oral lesions exhibit a mostly bilateral pattern, often manifesting in the inner buccal mucosa. The condition can be classified into three distinct forms, namely the reticular form, atrophic form, and bullous-erosive form.

The condition is classified as a premalignant lesion due to its significant likelihood of undergoing malignant transformation. The disease is characterized by the presence of T-lymphocyte infiltration in the basal cell layer of the epithelium and the presence of cytoid bodies, which are distinct histopathologic markers.

Leptin, a hormone generated by adipocytes, is involved in immunological responses and contributes to the development of autoimmunity. The presence of dyslipidemia has been found to be associated with lipoprotein (LP) abnormalities. Consequently, this study was undertaken to assess the blood leptin levels and lipid profile in individuals with LP. Leptin, a polypeptide hormone, is produced and released by white adipose tissue.

Multiple research have substantiated an increase in leptin levels among persons exhibiting elevated body mass index (BMI) and a higher percentage of total body fat. Additionally, it is involved in the cellular immune response and facilitates the development of autoimmunity.

There is a proposition suggesting that leptin has a role in the promotion of cytokine generation and modulation of helper T cells, potentially implicating its involvement in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The available information about leptin status in dermatological illnesses other than psoriasis is currently sparse. It is plausible that it may have a significant role in the pathogenesis of lichen planus.

However, there is a lack of literature regarding the levels of leptin in LP. There is an association between dyslipidemia and LP. Numerous investigations have consistently demonstrated notable deviations in lipid profile levels between individuals with LP and those in normal, healthy control cohorts. These findings have led researchers to posit a correlation between chronic inflammation and dyslipidemia, hence heightening the susceptibility to cardiovascular illnesses.

The potential impact of leptin on the progression of LP is being investigated.

Bozok University,OTHER,NCT05368779,Online Psychosocial Intervention for Nursing Students Who Experienced Intimate Partner Abuse in Turkey,Online Psychosocial Intervention for Nursing Students Who Experienced Intimate Partner Abuse in Turkey: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Intimate partner abuse is very common among university students. Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse.The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse.,"Background: Intimate partner abuse is very common among university students. Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse. An intervention with evidence-based applications to post-traumatic stress caused by intimate partner abuse and posttraumatic growth, using web-based applications that young people are familiar with, is considered important in order to protect the physical-mental health of university students, to increase their academic success, and to ensure that they establish healthy intimate partner relationships in the future.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse.

Methods: The randomized controlled study that did not use blinding employed a 2x5 split-plot design. The universe of the study consisted of 371 student nurses. Students who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: experimental (n=17) and control (n=18). The internet-based psychosocial intervention, which was based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, was delivered individually and electronically to the students in the experimental group in eight sessions, each lasting up to 120 minutes, using videoconferencing. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PGTI) were used to measure the outcomes at the pre-test, post-test, 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up.

Discussion: The internet-based psychosocial intervention was found to be effective in reducing post-traumatic stress and experiencing post-traumatic growth in student nurses who had been exposed to partner violence with these positive effects lasting for six months. This study is one of the first web-based randomized controlled studies to address post-traumatic stress and growth together in university students who were exposed to intimate partner violence. It is hoped that the results of the study will guide the research to be carried out in this context by internet intervention in the future.

Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse.The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse. Background: Intimate partner abuse is very common among university students. Post-traumatic stress disorder is one of the most serious mental diseases caused by intimate partner abuse. An intervention with evidence-based applications to post-traumatic stress caused by intimate partner abuse and posttraumatic growth, using web-based applications that young people are familiar with, is considered important in order to protect the physical-mental health of university students, to increase their academic success, and to ensure that they establish healthy intimate partner relationships in the future. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an internet-based psychosocial intervention based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches on post-traumatic stress and growth in student nurses who had experienced intimate partner abuse. Methods: The randomized controlled study that did not use blinding employed a 2x5 split-plot design. The universe of the study consisted of 371 student nurses. Students who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: experimental (n=17) and control (n=18). The internet-based psychosocial intervention, which was based on Social Learning Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques, was delivered individually and electronically to the students in the experimental group in eight sessions, each lasting up to 120 minutes, using videoconferencing. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PGTI) were used to measure the outcomes at the pre-test, post-test, 1-month follow-up, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. Discussion: The internet-based psychosocial intervention was found to be effective in reducing post-traumatic stress and experiencing post-traumatic growth in student nurses who had been exposed to partner violence with these positive effects lasting for six months. This study is one of the first web-based randomized controlled studies to address post-traumatic stress and growth together in university students who were exposed to intimate partner violence. It is hoped that the results of the study will guide the research to be carried out in this context by internet intervention in the future. \* This research was carried out as part of the Ege University Institute of Health Sciences Psychiatric Nursing Doctoral Thesis.

Patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccinated or non-exposed were included. Demographic, cycle characteristics, and laboratory outcomes were compared.","This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study performed at the Centro de Fertilidad y Genetica Novafem, Bogota, Colombia, and Clinica de la Mujer - Medicina Reproductiva, Viña del Mar, Chile. The Ethics Committee approved the study protocol of both centers. Informed contents were obtained from patients for data collection with scientific use.

All donors who underwent COS for oocyte donation between January 1st, 2018 and July 31th, 2022 were screened for eligibility and followed up to September 18th, 2022.

Oocyte donation cycles were utilized because this model is an excellent choice for controlling known female characteristics. Previous research concluded that a major predictor of ART outcomes is maternal age.

Eligibility criteria were donors aged older than 18 years or younger than 35 years. After providing informed consent, the patients were questioned about their confirmed past SARS-Cov-2 infection/vaccination status. Patients were categorized into the vaccinated group if they had received two dosages of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2 mRNA Pfizer-Biontech, mRNA-1273 Moderna or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Sinovac) with a break of at least three weeks between each dose. First and second vaccine dates were requested of vaccinated patients. Vaccine administration details, such as vaccine type, dose, date, manufacturer, and lot number, were collected from immunization records.

For recovering patients, the date of a negative nasopharyngeal COVID polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was registered. None of the recovering patients were vaccinated with any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Both clinics strictly required a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection 5 days before oocyte retrieval, except for those patients who were less than 3 months following recovery from SARS-Cov-2 infection. Patients in the control group were selected from medical records prior to March 2020 to ensure they did not have the infection and were not vaccinated.

Data including the patient age, body mass index (BMI), antral follicle count (AFC), anti mullerian hormone (AMH), days of stimulation, average dose of gonadotropins, the number of retrieved oocytes, mature oocytes, fertilized oocytes and top quality embryos obtained were recorded. Other parameters were calculated such as the ratio between the number of retrieved oocytes and the number of mature follicles in order to assess the adequacy of response of the follicle to the LH/hCG trigger; the fertilization rate (FR), which was defined as the proportion of inseminated oocytes with 2PN at the time of the fertilization check on Day 1 and finally the blastocyst development rate, defined as the proportion of 2PN zygotes which are at the blastocyst stage at Day 5.

Harbin Medical University,OTHER,NCT01024179,Relationship Between Initial Plaque Characteristics and Stent Surface Coverage Patterns,Relationship Between Initial Plaque Characteristics and Stent Surface Coverage Patterns After Sirolimus-eluting Stent Implantation Assessment by Optical Coherence Tomography,"Vulnerable plaque characterized by thin fibrous cap and large lipid core is an independent risk factor for most of acute cardiac event. Current clinical data showed that thin-cap fibroatheroma was more frequently observed in patients with ACS than SAP. Further OCT study indicated that patients with ACS had significantly higher incidence of incomplete neointimal coverage and malapposition after DES implantation than those with SAP. These findings imply that initial native lesion characteristics may be related to different vessel response (neointimal coverage and malapposition) after stenting. However, there is little data on the relationship between plaque characteristics and vascular response to DES after stent implantation evaluated by OCT.

Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the relationship between initial plaque characteristics and stent surface coverage or late malapposition after SES implantation. The investigators will use high resolution OCT to assess the initial culprit plaque morphology and subsequent vascular response after SES stenting at the time points of post-stenting, 6 months and 12 months. IVUS will also be performed to evaluate the tissue protrusion, malapposition, vessel remodeling at the same time points.","Vulnerable plaque characterized by thin fibrous cap and large lipid core is an independent risk factor for most of acute cardiac event.

M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,OTHER,NCT00093379,"Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Anal Cancer","A Phase II Study of Capecitabine (Xeloda)/Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) With Concomitant Radiotherapy (XRT), XELOX/RT in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Anal Canal","RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Capecitabine may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Capecitabine and oxaliplatin may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining capecitabine and oxaliplatin with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine and oxaliplatin together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage III anal cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine time to treatment failure in patients with stage II-IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and radiotherapy (i.e. Capecitabine (Xeloda)/Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) With Concomitant Radiotherapy (XRT) shortened to XELOX/XRT).
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

Secondary

* Determine the complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine 2-year local regional control in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine 2-year colostomy-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine 2-year median overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine 2-year progression-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral capecitabine\* twice daily on days 1-2, 6-10, 20-24, 27-31, and 41-42, and undergo radiotherapy\* once daily on days 1-3, 6-10, 13-17, 20-24, 27-31, 34-38, and 41-42. Patients also receive oxaliplatin intravenous (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

NOTE: \*Patients with T3-4 lesions also receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 43 and 44.

Patients are followed at 4-6 and 12 weeks and then periodically thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study.","Inclusion Criteria:

1. Previously untreated patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal.

6. Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease. Patients with measurable disease, as defined by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, have at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter to be recorded \>/= 20 mm using conventional techniques or \>/= 10 mm with spiral CT scan (with minimum lesion size no less than double the slice thickness). Lesions seen on colonoscopy or barium studies are not considered measurable lesions.
7. A negative pregnancy test in all women of child-bearing potential, within two weeks of initiating treatment.
8. The effects of oxaliplatin and capecitabine on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because cytotoxic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign the written informed consent/authorization document.

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Prior chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, capecitabine, or 5-fluorouracil.
2. Prior radiation to the pelvis.
3. Prior surgery for anal cancer excluding prior biopsy.
4. Known history of dihydropyrimidine (DPD) deficiency.
5. Known history of hypersensitivity to platinum-containing compounds.
6. Peripheral neuropathy of \>/= grade 2 by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 3.0.

8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit adherence with study requirements.
9. Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a requirement for intravenous (IV) alimentation.
10. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with oxaliplatin or capecitabine, breast feeding should be discontinued.
11. Because of the known interaction of capecitabine and coumadin, patients taking coumadin will be ineligible. Patients will be requested to discontinue coumadin and utilize Lovenox if agreeable. Patients must have discontinued coumadin for 7 days before initiating therapy.
12. No prior malignancies (excluding non-melanomatous skin neoplasms) over the past 5 years.
13. HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from this study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with capecitabine or oxaliplatin. This exclusion is for patient safety since patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, and because very few HIV-positive anal canal cancer patients are seen at this institution. This hinders us from accruing enough patients to adequately test the safety of this regimen in this population.

Patients with recurrent disease may have a limited number of sites of metastatic (spread) squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck. Another goal of this study is to learn how nivolumab impacts the immune system's ability to treat the cancer. While nivolumab is approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with metastatic SCCHN with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, the word ""investigational"" in this context means that the study drugs are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of head and neck cancers prior to surgery and thus is still being tested in research studies. However, the FDA is allowing the use of nivolumab in this study.

This study will have two arms. Cohort (arm) 1 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about 4 weeks before surgical resection (removal) of a newly diagnosed SCCHN. Twelve patients will be enrolled to this arm. Cohort 2 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about 4 weeks before surgical resection (removal) of SCCHN which has recurred and possibly spread to distant sites, but still can be resected with one surgery. Twelve patients will be enrolled to this arm.","Inclusion:

This research is being done to see if it is safe and feasible to give the investigational drugs, nivolumab (also known as BMS-936558) before surgery to people with newly diagnosed or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). Patients with recurrent disease may have a limited number of sites of metastatic (spread) squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck. Another goal of this study is to learn how nivolumab impacts the immune system's ability to treat the cancer. While nivolumab is approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with metastatic SCCHN with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, the word ""investigational"" in this context means that the study drugs are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of head and neck cancers prior to surgery and thus is still being tested in research studies. However, the FDA is allowing the use of nivolumab in this study. This study will have two arms. Cohort (arm) 1 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about 4 weeks before surgical resection (removal) of a newly diagnosed SCCHN. Twelve patients will be enrolled to this arm. Cohort 2 will examine one dose of nivolumab given about 4 weeks before surgical resection (removal) of SCCHN which has recurred and possibly spread to distant sites, but still can be resected with one surgery.

National Cancer Institute (NCI),NIH,NCT00043979,Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With High-Risk and Recurrent Pediatric Sarcomas,Pilot Study of Allogeneic/Syngeneic Blood Stem Cell Transplantation in Patients With High-Risk and Recurrent Pediatric Sarcomas,"This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplantation for treating patients with sarcomas (tumors of the bone, nerves, or soft tissue). Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow and blood stream that develop into blood cells. Stem cells transplanted from a healthy donor travel to the patient's bone marrow and begin producing normal cells. In patients with certain cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, the donor's immune cells attack the patient's cancer cells in what is called a ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect, contributing to cure of the disease. This study will determine whether this treatment can be used successfully to treat patients with sarcomas.

Patients between 4 and 35 years of age with a sarcoma that has spread from the primary site or cannot be removed surgically, and for whom effective treatment is not available, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have been diagnosed by the age of 30 at the time of enrollment. They must have a matched donor (usually a sibling). Participants undergo the following procedures:

Donors: Stem cells are collected from the donor. To do this, the hormone granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the cells are collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the stem cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm.

Patients: For patients who do not already have a central venous catheter (plastic tube), one is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body the entire treatment period for giving medications, transfusing blood, , withdrawing blood samples, and delivering the donated stem cells. Before the transplant procedure, patients receive from one to three cycles of ""induction"" chemotherapy, with each cycle consisting of 5 days of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by at least a 17-day rest period. All the drugs are infused through the catheter except prednisone, which is taken by mouth. After the induction therapy, the patient is admitted to the hospital for 5 days of chemotherapy with high doses of cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and fludarabine. Two days later, the stem cells are infused. The anticipated hospital stay is about 3 weeks, but may be longer if complications arise. Patients are discharged when their white cell count is near normal, they have no fever or infection, they can take sufficient food and fluids by mouth, and they have no signs of serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-a condition in which the donor's cells ""see"" the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response against them.

After hospital discharge, patients are followed in the clinic at least once or twice weekly for a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for 100 days. They receive medications to prevent infection and GVHD and, if needed, blood transfusions. If GVHD has not developed by about 120 days post transplant, patients receive additional white cells to boost the immune response. After 100 days, follow-up visits may be less frequent. Follow-up continues for at least 5 years. During the course of the study, patients undergo repeated medical evaluations, including blood tests and radiology studies, to check on the cancer and on any treatment side effects. On four occasions, white blood cells may be collected through apheresis to see if immune responses can be generated against the sarcomas treated in this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be done on five occasions. This test uses a radioactive material to produce images useful in detecting primary tumors and cancer that has spread.","Background:

* Treatment of pediatric sarcomas has enjoyed progress in the past 25 years for patients with localized, chemosensitive disease and prognostic factors are now available to identify subsets of patients who have very dismal prognoses; patients with primary metastatic disease, especially those with bone and bone marrow metastases.
* Patients with primary chemoresistant disease and early recurrence also have very poor prognoses and lack suitable treatment options. For these patients, it is critical that alternative approaches to cytotoxic chemotherapy be identified.
* Basic laboratory studies have shown that Ewing's sarcoma is susceptible to immune mediated mechanisms of cytolysis in vitro. Interestingly, for Ewing's sarcoma this appears to be true for both chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines.
* Recent progress in the field of bone marrow transplantation has identified approaches that can reproducibly induce allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell engraftment in adults with hematologic malignancies. In some cases, this same approach has shown beneficial effects for patients with solid tumors as a result of the development of allogeneic, immune-mediated graft versus tumor effects.

* To determine if the transplantation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched, peripheral blood stem cells can result in full donor engraftment (greater than 95 percent by day 100) in patients with high risk-pediatric sarcomas.
* To identify and characterize the toxicities of HLA-matched peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in patients with high-risk pediatric sarcomas. In particular we will identify the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and the pace of immune reconstitution in this population.
* To determine if allogeneic graft-versus-tumor responses following allogeneic PBSCT can induce clinically significant anti-tumor effects as measured by radiographic evidence of antitumor responses following PBSCT in patients with measurable disease and improved clinical outcome compared to historical controls in this patient population with a universally poor outcome.

Eligibility:

Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow and blood stream that develop into blood cells. Stem cells transplanted from a healthy donor travel to the patient's bone marrow and begin producing normal cells. In patients with certain cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, the donor's immune cells attack the patient's cancer cells in what is called a ""graft-versus-tumor"" effect, contributing to cure of the disease. This study will determine whether this treatment can be used successfully to treat patients with sarcomas. Patients between 4 and 35 years of age with a sarcoma that has spread from the primary site or cannot be removed surgically, and for whom effective treatment is not available, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have been diagnosed by the age of 30 at the time of enrollment. They must have a matched donor (usually a sibling). Participants undergo the following procedures: Donors: Stem cells are collected from the donor. To do this, the hormone granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the cells are collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the stem cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm. Patients: For patients who do not already have a central venous catheter (plastic tube), one is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body the entire treatment period for giving medications, transfusing blood, , withdrawing blood samples, and delivering the donated stem cells. Before the transplant procedure, patients receive from one to three cycles of ""induction"" chemotherapy, with each cycle consisting of 5 days of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by at least a 17-day rest period. All the drugs are infused through the catheter except prednisone, which is taken by mouth. After the induction therapy, the patient is admitted to the hospital for 5 days of chemotherapy with high doses of cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and fludarabine. Two days later, the stem cells are infused. The anticipated hospital stay is about 3 weeks, but may be longer if complications arise. Patients are discharged when their white cell count is near normal, they have no fever or infection, they can take sufficient food and fluids by mouth, and they have no signs of serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-a condition in which the donor's cells ""see"" the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response against them. After hospital discharge, patients are followed in the clinic at least once or twice weekly for a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests for 100 days. They receive medications to prevent infection and GVHD and, if needed, blood transfusions. If GVHD has not developed by about 120 days post transplant, patients receive additional white cells to boost the immune response. After 100 days, follow-up visits may be less frequent. Follow-up continues for at least 5 years. During the course of the study, patients undergo repeated medical evaluations, including blood tests and radiology studies, to check on the cancer and on any treatment side effects. On four occasions, white blood cells may be collected through apheresis to see if immune responses can be generated against the sarcomas treated in this study. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be done on five occasions. This test uses a radioactive material to produce images useful in detecting primary tumors and cancer that has spread. Background: * Treatment of pediatric sarcomas has enjoyed progress in the past 25 years for patients with localized, chemosensitive disease and prognostic factors are now available to identify subsets of patients who have very dismal prognoses; patients with primary metastatic disease, especially those with bone and bone marrow metastases. * Patients with primary chemoresistant disease and early recurrence also have very poor prognoses and lack suitable treatment options. For these patients, it is critical that alternative approaches to cytotoxic chemotherapy be identified. * Basic laboratory studies have shown that Ewing's sarcoma is susceptible to immune mediated mechanisms of cytolysis in vitro. Interestingly, for Ewing's sarcoma this appears to be true for both chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines. * Recent progress in the field of bone marrow transplantation has identified approaches that can reproducibly induce allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell engraftment in adults with hematologic malignancies. In some cases, this same approach has shown beneficial effects for patients with solid tumors as a result of the development of allogeneic, immune-mediated graft versus tumor effects. Objectives: * To determine if the transplantation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched, peripheral blood stem cells can result in full donor engraftment (greater than 95 percent by day 100) in patients with high risk-pediatric sarcomas. * To identify and characterize the toxicities of HLA-matched peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) in patients with high-risk pediatric sarcomas.

Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University,OTHER,NCT01763879,Pressure-controlled vs Volume Controlled Ventilation on RV Function During OLV,Right Ventricular Function During One-lung Ventilation: The Effects of Pressure Controlled and Volume Controlled Ventilation,"The use of pressure controlled ventilation (TV) during one lung ventilation (OLV) for thoracic surgery is associated with comparable oxygenation with volume controlled ventilation (VCV) with added benefits of decreasing airway pressures and shunt fraction. The later may improve the right ventricular (RV) function during OLV. We postulate that the use of PCV during OLV for thoracic surgery would preserve RV function than during VCV. After local ethics committee approval and informed consent, we will randomly allocate 28 patients scheduled for elective thoracic surgery OLV to randomly crossed from PCV to VCV mode (n= 14 for each) during with VT of 6 mL/kg, I: E ratio 1: 2.5, PEEP of 5 cm H2O, recruitment maneuvers and respiratory rate will be adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Intraoperative changes in the right ventricular function (peak systolic and diastolic tricuspid annular velocity (TAV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and RV fractional area changes (RV-FAC)), hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters, peak and plateau airway pressures, compliance will be recorded.","One-lung ventilation (OLV) provides excellent operative field for thoracic procedures, but is opposed by the harmful impairment of cardiac index and right ventricular (RV) function which may influence postoperative morbidity and mortality. In our previous study, we demonstrated significant reductions in RV ejection fraction (REF) and CI values after the initiation of OLV attributable to the increased right ventricular afterload, stroke work and end-diastolic volume augmented by increased airway pressures. This may be harmful with the patients with advanced obstructive lung diseases and those with pulmonary hypertension. Thus there is no doubt that decreases in airway pressures will be associated with better RV function.

Volume controlled ventilation (VCV) is the commonly used traditional ventilation mode for OLV during thoracic procedures but its use is associated with deleterious increases in airway pressure which may impede RV function.

Pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) is an alternative mode of ventilation which is widely used in the patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI), whereby high initial flow rates are delivered to quickly achieve and maintain the set inspiratory pressure followed by rapidly decelerating flow.These high initial flow rates lead to a more rapid alveolar inflation.

PCV has been suggested as a useful tool to improve oxygenation as well as decreases in intra-pulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) and airway pressures compared with VCV during OLV for patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Whereas, others demonstrated comparable arterial oxygenation with the use of PCV and VCV during OLV.

However, the use of PCV offers advantages over VCV during OLV in the term of reducing mean and bronchial peak airway pressures and intrapulmonary shunt, hence limiting the risk for barotrauma and impaired RV function.

Up to the investigators knowledge, there is no available study of the effects of PCV and VCV on RV function during OLV after thoracic surgery.

The investigators hypothesize that the use of PCV during OLV will be associated with preserved RV function than during the use of VCV. They will compare the effects of the use of PCV and VCV with 5 cm H2O level of PEEP and recruitment maneuvers during OLV on the right ventricular function (peak systolic and diastolic tricuspid annular velocity (TAV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and RV fractional area changes (RV-FAC)), hemodynamic parameters (heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure, (MAP)), oxygenation parameters (arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension (PaO2 and PaCO2, respectively), and arterial tension to inspired fraction of oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio), ventilation parameters (peak and plateau airway pressures (Ppk and Ppl, respectively) and compliance) and the ICU and hospital length-of-stays, morbidity and 30-day mortality.

Sample size calculation:

A priori power analysis of the previous published data11 showed that the investigators will need to study 13 pairs to detect a 20% difference in the mean maximal systolic TAV values (7.0 cm/s) with a SD of 1.4 cm/s, after start of OLV, a type-I error of 0.05 and a power of 90%. We will add 10% more patients for a final sample size of 28 patients to account for patients dropping out during the study.

Interventions:

In all patients, standard monitors will be applied. A thoracic epidural or paravertebral catheter will be inserted with no more use of local anesthetics during the study to avoid their effects on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.12 An arterial line (20 G) and a right internal jugular vein catheter will be inserted. Anesthetic technique will be standardized in all studied patients. Anesthesiologists who will give the anaesthetic will be not involved in the patient's assessment. General anesthesia will be induced with propofol (2-3 mg/kg), fentanyl (2-3 µg/kg), and cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) will be given to facilitate tracheal intubation with a left-sided double-lumen tube (DLT). The correct position of its tip will be confirmed with a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Anesthesia will be maintained with 1-1.5 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane and increments of fentanyl (0.5µg/kg) and cisatracurium (0.04 mg/kg).

The patients' lungs will be mechanically ventilated using VCV mode, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 in air, tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL/kg (predicted body weight), inspiratory to expiratory \[I: E\] ratio of 1:2.5, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, respiratory rate (R.R) will be adjusted to achieve an PaCO2 of 35-45 mm Hg, peak inspiratory pressures (Ppk) will be limited to 35 cm H2O and a low fresh gas flow (FGF) (\<2 L/min) in a semi closed circuit system.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) will be inserted and the right ventricular function will be assessed with the measurements of EDV, ESV, RVEF, both maximal systolic and diastolic TAV at the tricuspid annulus at the RV free wall recorded from the apical 4-chamber views using pulsed wave Doppler tissue imaging.

All operations will be performed by the same surgeons. Intraoperative hypoxemia will be defined as decrease in arterial oxygen saturation less than 90% will be treated with increasing of FiO2 to 1.0. Addition of low level of 2 cm H2O of CPAP will be considered if the later fails to correct hypoxemia. 1 Intraoperative fluid therapy will include intravenous infusion of 2 ml/kg/hour of Lactated Ringer's solution and blood losses will be compensated with colloids and with red blood cell concentrates if the hemoglobin levels decreases below 8 to 9 g/dL. Mean arterial blood pressure will be maintained greater than 60 mm Hg using bolus doses of ephedrine 5 mg or phenylephrine 100 ug. Urine output will be maintained to be greater than 0.5 ml/kg/hour.

At the end of surgery, the nondependent will be re-expanded and TLV will be resumed as before surgery, sevoflurane will be discontinued, the residual neuromuscular block will be antagonized, and the patient will be extubated. Postoperative analgesia will be accomplished with the use of continuous epidural/paravertebral infusion of bupivacaine 0.125% and fentanyl 2 µg/mL.

Statistical Analysis:

Data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Fisher exact test will be used for categorical data. Repeated two-way ANOVA and paired t-test will be used to study the changes in the primary and secondary endpoints during each intervention. The Wilcoxon 2 rank sum test will be used for the non-parametric values. We will avoid the carryover effect (persistence of the effect of the first intervention on the operative conditions into the second period) through the comparison of the effects of period (time effect) and the order of treatment using independent t-tests. Data will be expressed as mean ± SD, number (%), or median \[range\]. A value of P \< 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.","Inclusion Criteria:

The knees, lower back and hip/groin were the most common injury locations. It has been postulated that reduced physical capacity (e.g strength, flexibility, stability) in the knees, lower back and hip/groin can increase the risk of injuries in rhythmic gymnastics.

In addition, more than 30% of the Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts experience urinary incontinence (UI), and 70% reported that UI negatively affected sports performance (Gram, M., \& Bø, K., 2020). Few of the rhythmic gymnasts had any knowledge about the pelvic floor.

Hence, this assessor blinded cluster randomized controlled trial aims to find out whether the implementation of exercises targeting reduced physical capacity and pelvic floor dysfunction can prevent/reduce the prevalence of overuse injuries and UI.","BACKGROUND

Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts have high prevalence and incidence of overuse injuries. Previous research on risk factors related to injuries in rhythmic gymnastics (RG) has implied that high weekly training load, hypermobility, poor technic and inappropriate training load increase the risk of injuries. A prospective study also found that previous injury increased the risk of injuries substantially (Gram, M., Clarsen, B., \& Bø, K., 2021). Hence, injury prevention interventions should start at an early age to avoid the first injury. In addition, since the aetiology and mechanisms of injuries are multifactorial, with a well described complex interaction of internal and external risk factors making a gymnast more or less prone to sustain an injury, there might be a need to assess some internal risk factors more thoroughly. The modifiable internal risk factor physical capacity, e.g. strength, flexibility, stability, might be of particular interest, since lack of physical capacity can be thought of as a potential underlying cause in all of the above-mentioned risk factors. In addition, it is well known how persistent lack of physical capacity relative to the requirements in a sport might lead to injuries. With knees, lower back and hip/groin as the most commonly reported injury locations, clinical assessment of strength, flexibility and stability in these locations has been conducted in a cross-sectional study before this randomized controlled trial (RCT). Reduced physical capacity revealed in the cross-sectional study will be targeted/brought forward in the exercise program in the RCT.

The most common types of pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFD) are urinary incontinence (UI), anal incontinence (AI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). UI has high prevalence among female athletes participating in sports including jumping and running (high impact). A prevalence of 80% was found in young, nulliparous high-level trampoline jumpers in Sweden (Eliasson et.al., 2008). The prevalence among Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts was \>30%, while Thyssen et.al. found that 56% of female Danish artistic gymnasts and 43% of dancers reported UI. UI negatively affects sports performance, and symptoms at young age is a risk factor of future UI developing during pregnancy and after childbirth. Hence, interventions toward prevention and treatment is necessary. While strength training of the pelvic floor muscles has 1A level of evidence/recommendation to treat UI in the general female population, and has no known adverse effects, there is little knowledge of this among young female athletes and dancers. Search on PubMed revealed only one RCT assessing the effect of pelvic floor muscle training on UI in female athletes. Ferreira et.al. randomized 32 female volleyball players to 3 months of pelvic floor muscle training or control, and found statistically significant improvement in the exercise group in frequency of leakage and urine loss measured during physical activity(p\< 0.001). Hence, there seem to be a potential for prevention and treatment also in athletes exposed to heavy load towards the pelvic floor.

AIMS

The aims of this RCT are to investigate if implementation of prophylactic exercises targeting reduced capacity and pelvic floor dysfunction can prevent/lower the prevalence of overuse injuries and UI among Norwegian rhythmic gymnasts.

Unity Health Toronto,OTHER,NCT02481479,Saxagliptin and Cardiac Structure and Function,SCARF: Saxagliptin on CArdiac StRucture and Function,"Diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of heart failure, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the development of new therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control, recent clinical data from the saxagliptin assessment of vascular outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (SAVOR-TIMI) 53 study observed an unexpected finding of an excess of adjudicated heart failure hospitalizations. This excess occurred in the setting of pre-existing heart failure (HF) hospitalization and in those with elevated biomarkers for heart failure such as N terminal pro Brain type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). A wealth of preclinical data did not suggest a mechanistic basis for an excess of heart failure events, however these preclinical studies primarily focused upon prevention based strategies as opposed to regression studies once established heart failure was present. This proposal seeks to understand if and how dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i,specifically saxagliptin) may influence the development of heart failure, by evaluating changes in cardiac structure and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","The cardiovascular safety and potential cardioprotective effects of diabetes drugs have been the focus of recent research. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all new anti-diabetic drugs to demonstrate no important increase in cardiovascular adverse events before approval.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are oral incretin-based agents that increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level, with proven anti-hyperglycemic effects and are increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes. In a rat model of diabetes and myocardial infarction, sitagliptin treatment improved passive left ventricular compliance, increased endothelial cell density, reduced myocyte hypertrophy and collagen abundance. GLP-1 and DDP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin improve cardiac function, cardiac remodeling, and survival in animal models of pressure-overload and chronic heart failure. However, in another study of post-MI cardiac remodeling in mice, vildagliptin failed to show any early or late protective effects on cardiac function.

Some clinical studies suggest that GLP-1 infusion is associated with an absolute increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure, although data are conflicting. The GLP-1 receptor analog, exenatide may reduce infarct size in patients with myocardial infarction but does not improve LVEF.

The Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Alogliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome EXAMINE trial randomized assigned 5340 patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome to alogliptin or placebo, and found no increase in adverse cardiovascular events in the alogliptin group. In SAVOR-TIMI 53, 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events were randomized to receive saxagliptin or placebo. Over a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P=0.99 for superiority; P\<0.001 for noninferiority). However, patients in the saxagliptin group were more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure, which was not ascertained in the EXAMINE trial. Furthermore, the Sitagliptin Cardiovascular Outcome Study (TECOS), which examined the DPP4i sitagliptin versus placebo in high risk patients for a cardiovascular event demonstrated cardiovascular safety (P\<0.001 for non inferiority), and there was no signal for excess heart failure hospitalizations.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as the ""gold standard"" for measuring LV volume, mass, and ejection fraction. LV volume measurements by cardiac MRI do not rely on geometric assumptions. CMR measurements have excellent intra-observer, inter-observer, and inter-study variability, which were superior to other imaging techniques. The high inter-study reproducibility of CMR affords a substantial reduction in the required sample size to demonstrate even small changes in LV volume, LV mass or LVEF, or conversely, to reliably exclude clinically important changes. Furthermore, CMR tagging allows detailed and quantitative assessment of regional LV diastolic and systolic function. For example, in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), CMR can detect subtle alterations in global and regional LV functions in patients with traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Although prior studies have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects of improved glycemic control on myocardial function, CMR promises to be a more sensitive and accurate technique.

Accordingly, the investigators propose to use CMR to examine the cardiac structure, global and regional function among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with saxagliptin.","Inclusion Criteria:

The prevalence rate in England is reported to be between 1-2.4%. OLP contributed to around 40% of all visits or 1,200 appointments in 2014 at the Eastman Dental Hospital. Pain, discomfort, long-standing use of medications, lesion recurrence and adverse side effects of therapy are commonly associated with OLP, eventually leading to a significant reduction in a patient quality of life. In addition, there is also increased risk of developing oral cancer in patients with OLP. The current gold standard treatment for OLP is corticosteroid, which can result in adverse side effects including increased risk of infections and skin cancer, reduced systemic immune system, and hepatotoxicity with long-term usage.

Alternatively, a probiotic food supplement, VSL#3, has shown evidence of been able to induce and maintain remission in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), with no adverse effect a part than bloating, reported. Additionally, a preliminary report shown that probiotics treatment in Behcet's disease and Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) lesion resulted in reducing the number of oral ulcerations and subjective relief of oral discomfort.

Investigator designed a clinical trial with 30 participants allocated to one of two interventions, VSL#3 or placebo. Individuals with biopsy-confirmed OLP who experience painful symptoms will be recruited from a single site research site (Eastman Dental Hospital (EDH)). Either the active VSL#3 or the placebo, provided by Ferring Pharmaceuticals Limited, will be consume twice a day over a 30 days period. Questionnaires that will determine pain levels, disease activity and quality of life will be completed before the study begins, on days 15, 30 and 30 days after the last supplement intake. In addition saliva and blood samples will be taken before therapy begin, at 30 days of therapy, and 30 days after the last supplement intake. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the oral microbiota will be investigated using these samples. A blinded clinician will assess the clinical effects between groups of active VSL #3 and placebo and the results will analyze by statistician.","Primary objective:

• To investigate the effects of 30 days use of supplement therapy of probiotic VSL#3 on painful symptoms of OLP at the end of the therapy (30-days endpoint) and 30 days after the last dose (60-days endpoint).

Secondary objective:

1. To investigate the effects of 30 days use of supplement therapy of probiotic VSL#3 on OLP disease activity.
2. To investigate the effect of 30 days use of supplement therapy of probiotic VSL#3 on quality of life.
3. To investigate acceptability of the intervention and potential adverse effects. and for the mechanistic study, whether :

   * The use of VSL#3 is associated with metagenomics changes in saliva.
   * The use of VSL#3 is associated with changes in the serum expression profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

A randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial study on individuals with OLP.

Patients with painful ulcerative biopsy-confirmed OLP attending the Oral Medicine clinics of the UCLH ( University college of London hospital) Eastman Hospital and meeting the inclusion criteria of the study will be given information about the trial and invited to participate.

30 individuals who consent will be recruited and randomised in two groups: group A (15 participants) will receive the VSL#3 and group B (15 participants) will receive a placebo. A centralised computer-generated randomization list provided by an independent third party will be used to conceal allocation of patients to the treatments. The list will be sent to the drug manufacturer who will label the VSL#3 or placebo with relevant study participant code, which will come in the same identical plain-packages to ensure blinding (neither the participants nor the investigator will be aware of the sachets content). The study statistician will also be blinded to the allocation. Patients will be allowed to use best standard therapy during the study.

To demonstrate the research hypotheses, Investigators will record oral painful symptoms, disease activity, and quality of life in participants before, at 15 and 30 days from treatment start, and 30 days (day 60) after the last VSL#3 supplement intake.

The prevalence rate in England is reported to be between 1-2.4%. OLP contributed to around 40% of all visits or 1,200 appointments in 2014 at the Eastman Dental Hospital. Pain, discomfort, long-standing use of medications, lesion recurrence and adverse side effects of therapy are commonly associated with OLP, eventually leading to a significant reduction in a patient quality of life. In addition, there is also increased risk of developing oral cancer in patients with OLP. The current gold standard treatment for OLP is corticosteroid, which can result in adverse side effects including increased risk of infections and skin cancer, reduced systemic immune system, and hepatotoxicity with long-term usage. Alternatively, a probiotic food supplement, VSL#3, has shown evidence of been able to induce and maintain remission in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), with no adverse effect a part than bloating, reported. Additionally, a preliminary report shown that probiotics treatment in Behcet's disease and Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) lesion resulted in reducing the number of oral ulcerations and subjective relief of oral discomfort. Investigator designed a clinical trial with 30 participants allocated to one of two interventions, VSL#3 or placebo. Individuals with biopsy-confirmed OLP who experience painful symptoms will be recruited from a single site research site (Eastman Dental Hospital (EDH)). Either the active VSL#3 or the placebo, provided by Ferring Pharmaceuticals Limited, will be consume twice a day over a 30 days period. Questionnaires that will determine pain levels, disease activity and quality of life will be completed before the study begins, on days 15, 30 and 30 days after the last supplement intake. In addition saliva and blood samples will be taken before therapy begin, at 30 days of therapy, and 30 days after the last supplement intake.

People with hypochondriasis believe that real or imagined physical symptoms are signs of serious illnesses, despite medical reassurance and other evidence to the contrary. Symptoms of the disorder include a preoccupation with fear of an illness; a persistent fear of having a serious illness, despite medical reassurance; and misinterpretation of symptoms. Some individuals with hypochondriasis recognize that their fear of having a serious illness may be excessive, unreasonable, or unfounded. Episodes of hypochondriasis usually last from months to years, with equally long periods of remission.

Most infants and children and many teenagers need deep sedation or light general anesthesia to complete a successful and safe procedure. Induction of general anesthesia is a stressful procedure itself. Strategies to reduce preanesthesia anxiety include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions.

However, this evidence is based mainly on self reports rather than objective measurements. Therefore, objective and non-invasive measurements to be utilized in the current study, should provide an assessment tools regardless the children's age.

Background: Since the advent of pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy in the early 1970's, there has been a remarkable increase in the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed in infants and children. Performance of endoscopy in children requires more patience, experience, and expertise than in adults. The anxiety of the children is related to parent's separation, loss of self-control, unknown surroundings and strange people that are taking care of them, and frequently unpleasant or even painful procedures. Painful and frightening procedures in children have been shown to result in short-term physiologic changes and long-term behavioral changes. The response to unpleasant stimuli with stress and fear may be exaggerated in children and experienced as pain. Most infants and children and many teenagers need deep sedation or light general anesthesia to complete a successful and safe procedure. Induction of general anesthesia is a stressful procedure itself. Strategies to reduce preanesthesia anxiety include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions.

Dream doctors are professional medical clowns or stage artists, who received training specifically to understand medical patient's need and to give the patient adjuvant therapy during hospital admissions or ambulatory treatment. Laughter has physiological effects on different body mechanisms and it affects the cardiovascular system (decreasing heart rate and blood pressure), strengthens the immune system, and lowers level of stress hormones like Norepinephrine. Humor can also help in strengthening the bond between therapist and patient and reduce stress and anxiety and enhance recovery. The Israel dream doctors project, integrates professional medical clowning into the medical services provided at Israeli hospitals. The DDs are part of the multidisciplinary staff, principally but not only, in pediatric wards. Studies already proved that presence of medical clowns significantly reduces the level of anxiety during induction of anesthesia in children. In the pediatric ward in Afula Medical Center, the investigators have experience with DDs for preparing children to kidney scans.

Pre-Puls Inhibition PPI A computerized human startle response monitoring system (SR-HLAB STARTLE REFLEX, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) was used to deliver acoustic startle stimuli via headphones and record and score the corresponding electro myographic activity from the orbicularis oculi muscle. Two disposable electrodes (sensor area 12 mm2) were placed approximately 0.75-1cm below the pupil on the orbicularis oculi muscle and 3rd reference electrode on the mastoid bone. The skin area at the electrode site was cleaned with a cotton swab saturated with rubbing alcohol, then prepared by gently rubbing a small amount of EEG \& ECG Skin Prepping Gel (Signa Gel- Parker Laboratories Inc., Fairfield, New jersey, USA), and cleaned again with a cotton swab.

The session (a total of 56 trials) is started with 3 min acclimatization period with a 60 dB background noise level that is delivered continuously throughout the test session. The session is comprised from two blocks. block1: comprised from randomly delivered six trials of single 40 msec 120 dB ""pulse alone"" startle stimuli in order to evaluate the startle response, ten ""pre"" stimuli (at 74, 78, 82, 86 or 92 dB), and thirty ""pre pulse"" trials that consisted of a single 120 dB pulse preceded (120 msec inter-stimulus-interval) by a 20 msec pre pulse of 14, 18, 22, 26 or 32 dB above background (i.e., 74, 78, 82, 86 or 92 dB). Block1 trials were delivered on average 20 sec inter-trial-interval ITI (15-25 sec, total 46 trials). Block2: comprised of the last ten trials of ""pulse alone"" startle, at fixed 2 sec ITI in order to evaluate a measure of habituation in response to repeated delivery of the startling stimuli. Finally, prepulse inhibition (PPI) was calculated as the percent of the habituated response as follows \[100-(max response to ""pre pulse"" trial / max response to ""pulse alone"" trial X 100)\]

GSR - Galvanic Skin Response Electrodermal activity will be measured by the differences of the skin conductivity. Two 5 mm electrodes will be placed on fingers 2 and 4 of the non-dominant hand. The electrodes will be connected to sensor and amplifying receiver with a 10Hz sampling rate.

Different portions of the skin can show differences in conductivity, due to sweat related to stress. Thus, measuring the skin conductivity of the non-dominant hand was shown to reduce this variability.

Hypothesis of the study: 1) DDs lessen the level of anxiety and attention impairment in children undergoing gastroscopies. 2) DDs improve the satisfaction of children and their parents during gastroscopies.

The aim of this study is: 1) To explore the influence of DDs on the satisfaction of children and their parents undergoing gastroscopy, utilizing questioners. 2) To explore the effects of DDs on anxiety and attention of children and their parents, undergoing gastroscopies by means of GSR, startle response and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) tests and measuring anxiety-related biologic indices.

Patients and Methods: This randomized, controlled study will be conducted with children undergoing deep sedation during pediatric upper gastrointestinal endoscopies in the Gastroenterology institute of the Emek Medical Center,Afula, Israel. One hundred children (age 1-18 years) scheduled to undergo deep sedation and elective gastroscopy will be enrolled. During enrollment, the potential clown involvement will be explained to parents. Patients will be assigned to one of two groups: Group 1:children and their parents with the presence of DD upon arrival to the Gastroenterology institute and throughout the induction of sedation, gastroscopy and recovery. Group 2: children and their parents undergoing gastroscopy with deep sedation without the presence of a DD.

The randomization process: In Afula Medical Center, the investigators perform gastroscopies weekly. During the study period the investigators will perform the gastroscopies one week with the DD and one week without the DD.The patients will not be aware to that fact that in some weeks the DD is participating during the sedation induction in some of the patients (every other week). The DD will use various methods for entertaining the child and alleviate stress according to the child's age. The parents and the children will be given anxiety questioners to fill before the induction of sedation. At the end of the gastroscopy the parents and the children will be given satisfaction questioners. The children will perform Pre-Pulse inhibition (PPI) test and GSR before and after the gastroscopy to assess physiological and biological emotional and cognitive consequences. The parents will perform PPI test and GSR before, during and after the gastroscopy (no caffeine or nicotine consumption will be allowed 30min before examination). The anesthesiologist and the nurse at the recovery room will fill a questioner evaluating the behavior of the child during the induction of sedation and awakening. While inserting an IV line blood spots will be taken for stress hormones: cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. The following physical indices will be measured: blood pressure, pulse, saturation and body temperature. The amount of drugs given for deep sedation will be evaluated.

The current study hold two major innovativeness: (a) The effects of DD as part of the medical team in gastroscopy in children. (b) The physiological and biological evaluation of the emotional and cognitive consequences in children and their parents during gastroscopy.

Statistical analysis:

The study design is Mixed design (2X3), with DD as between subject factor (with or without DD) and stage of treatment as within subject factor (prior, during and after gastroscopy examination).Thus, we will conduct a Two-Way ANOVA (2X3) with post hoc Tukey's test. Significant interactions will be further analyzed with One-Way ANOVA. Moreover to relate physiological and biological measurement to questioner items, Pearson's correlations will be calculated.

The study schedule:

1. Recruitment: 1.5 year
2. Study period: for each patient the study will be held during the day of gastroscopy.
3. Examination of blood serum by ELISA: 3 months.

3. Analysis of results: three months 4. Targeted date as to completion of project: two years from the study beginning.

This is a research study to verify the same effectiveness and safety profile for the test product, Nicorette Strongmint lozenge, as for an already approved product, NiQuitin® Minimint lozenge (reference product), in a standardized mode. This verification is done in a so-called bioequivalence study, which means that the same amount of the same active substance (nicotine), in the same dosage form, for the same route of administration, and meeting the same or comparable standards is performed. During the study visits, blood samples will be drawn to measure the level of the substance in the blood to verify that the two products are comparable.

University of Florida,OTHER,NCT02780479,Steroids in Children Hospitalized With Asthma,Oral Dexamethasone Versus Oral Prednisone in Children Hospitalized With Asthma: A Randomized Control Study,"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children. A short (3-5 day) course of a short-acting steroid such as Prednisone or Prednisolone has long been the standard of care for asthma exacerbation. Dexamethasone efficacy in asthma exacerbation has been studied in the outpatient setting and was found to be as effective as Prednisone. Dexamethasone has the advantage of shorter course, more compliance, and more tolerable. This has led many emergency departments to provide a 1-2 dose course of Dexamethasone on discharge. Thus, many inpatients have received a first dose of Dexamethasone prior to reaching the inpatient unit, leading to confusion about the best plan for these patients. Many hospitalist pediatricians continue to give a 5-day total course with Prednisone, but some patients have begun to receive a second dose of Dexamethasone 24 hours after the first dose. To our knowledge, no studies have been done to compare the efficacy of these two protocols in pediatric patients requiring hospitalization. The hypothesis is that a second dose of Dexamethasone is as effective as four additional days of Prednisone in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbation. This is an open label, randomized control study comparing these treatments in children age 2-18 hospitalized with asthma exacerbation who have received a first dose of Dexamethasone.","Corticosteroids are the first-line therapy for managing acute asthma exacerbations. Studies have shown that systemic steroids effect decrease relapse and hospital admission. Due to its short half-life, Prednisone is usually given daily or twice daily for 3-5 days. It has been associated with poor compliance due it the prolonged course. Dexamethasone half-life is 36 - 72 hours.

Several studies have shown no difference in outcomes between 3-5 days of prednisone and different forms of dexamethasone, including single intramuscular dose or single oral dose or two oral doses 1 day apart. However, those studies were done in the emergency department (ED). Lack of response to initial asthma treatment in ED results in admission to the hospital, implying more severe exacerbation than those able to be discharged. Some clinician shift to oral prednisone once admitted to the floor for patients who have received Dexamethasone or not. Others have begin to complete the Dexamethasone course with one more dose of Dexamethasone 24 hour after the first dose. Dexamethasone has the advantage of compliance and tolerability, however, no studies investigated its efficacy in hospitalized patients. Such knowledge will improve patient's compliance and outcomes.

Instituto Bernabeu,OTHER,NCT02372279,Prospective Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effect of Embryonic Observation on the Gestation (PROdE),Prospective Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effect of Embryonic Observation on the Live Birth Rate (LBR),"In a conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, daily microscopic observation of embryos outside the incubator to assess their morphology and establish a selection process is performed. In this way it is possible to know which embryo or embryos have greater implantantion capacity and will be transferred to the uterus to obtain a viable pregnancy. However, these observations can produce deleterious effects on embryo development due to changes in temperature, pH and osmolarity of the culture media, as well as a negative effect of direct light microscope for observation. This project aims to test the hypothesis that non-embryonic observation produces a beneficial effect on embryo quality until day 5 of development (blastocyst stage) and, therefore, on rates of implantation and ongoing gestation, compared with the conventional protocol of observations under the inverted microscope on days two, three and five of development.","The present study is a prospective double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) approved by a local Ethics Committe. Summarily, in the control group we did three embryo observations outside the incubator as we usually do in our conventional protocol: day 2, day 3 and day 5, just before ET; in the study group we performed a unique embryo observation on day 5 before ET. All the subjects that participated in the study were informed and gave us their consent to take part on it.

The inclusion criteria of the study were: first cycle of ART treatment with conventional IVF or ICSI with donated eggs, normal uterine cavity and a single or double embryo transfer, always performed on day 5 at blastocyst stage.

The exclusion criteria were the following: patients above 50 years old, patients that were diagnosed with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and/or recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) or uterine pathologies, body mass index \>30 kg/m2, the use of seminal samples coming from donors or testicular origin and cycles that included preimplantational genetic testing (PGT).

LBR was the main outcome of our study, defined as the number of deliveries that resulted in a live born neonate, expressed per 100 embryo transfers (Zegers- Hochschild et al., 2009). Secondary efficacy endpoints were positive hCG rate (\>5 mUI/mL, assessed in serum 14 days after oocyte retrieval), implantation rate (number of gestational sacs observed divided by the number of embryos transferred, expressed as a percentage, %), ongoing pregnancy rate, defined as a pregnancy with a detectable heart rate at 12 weeks of gestation or beyond and miscarriage (loss of a pregnancy after 12 weeks of gestation).

In addition, we assessed the next IVF laboratory parameters: fertilization rate, blastocyst formation rate on day 5, blastocyst quality, number of transferred embryos and number of usable blastocysts (number of blastocysts transferred and frozen).

The sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome. We assumed a live birth rate of 40% in the control group, compared to 50% in the non-observational group deduced from previous studies. By applicating the sample size calculation program, 776 patients (388 per group) were required in order to detect a risk difference (RD) of 10% between the two groups in the final analysis, with a power of 80% at a two-sided, adjusted alpha-level of 0.05.

The pneumoperitoneum and deep Trendelenburg position (at least 25°-45° upside down) required for RALP surgeries can cause significant pathophysiological changes in both the pulmonary and cardiac systems, as well as complicate hemodynamic management.

In this study, investigators aimed to determine the changes in the cardiovascular system during deep Trendelenburg position with the hemodynamic parameters monitored by the pressure record analytical method (PRAM) and the Longitudinal Strain measured with simultaneous transesophageal echocardiography.","RALP is the gold standard surgical technique in prostate surgery. Many Robotic-laparoscopic surgical techniques also require the intraoperative deep Trendelenburg position. However, the possible side effects of the deep Trendelenburg position on the cardiovascular system during surgery are unknown. Although the Trendelenburg position is a life-saving maneuver in hypovolemic patients, it also carries undesirable risks. Although the increase in venous return is expected to protect the cardiac output (CO) in the deep Trendelenburg position, the increase in intrathoracic pressure due to the intraperitoneal pressure may cause deterioration in venous return and a decrease in CO . In addition, the changing heart configuration in the deep Trendelenburg position may also cause an increase in the workload of the heart. Therefore, the need to evaluate hemodynamic management with advanced monitoring techniques, including fluid therapy in the perioperative period, has arisen in patients undergoing RALP.

The pressure Recording Analytical Method (PRAM), is one of the most up-to-date monitoring methods designed for continuous CO measurement derived from the arterial pressure wave analysis, with a high signal sampling rate (1000 Hz). Many studies have shown that PRAM is a reliable monitoring method in major surgery. Cardiac Cycle Efficiency (CCE), which the PRAM method adds to our daily practice, is an index that defines hemodynamic performance in terms of energy consumption and efficiency. It can be expressed as the ratio of systolic energy performance to the total energy expenditure of the cardiac cycle and indicates the ability of the cardiovascular system to maintain homeostasis at different energy levels. However, data on how cardiac functions change in the deep Trendelenburg position are still limited.

In this study, investigators aimed to demonstrate the reliability of the CCE value through its correlation with the Longitudinal Strain (LS) by observing the effect of the deep Trendelenburg position in RALP surgeries on cardiac functions using PRAM and Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE).","Inclusion Criteria:

"University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland",OTHER,NCT01540279,Clinical Outcome in View of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) With Antibacterial Skin Sutures,Do Antibacterial Skin Sutures Reduce Surgical Site Infections After Open Abdominal Surgery?,"Background: Poor wound healing and the development of surgical site infection (SSI) continue to occur and remain a significant cause of disability among operated patients. In spite of the substantial advances in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention it remains one of the most common complications in conventional abdominal surgery with an incidence in the literature between 4% and 17%. As it is known that surgical sutures potentiate the development of wound infection the search for an ideal suture material, suitable for all purposes has been pursued by surgeons for decades.

Hypothesis: In line with in-vitro results the investigators hypothesize that the use of antibacterial skin sutures with triclosan poliglecaprone 25 reduces the rate of SSI after open abdominal surgery Methods: To prevent microbial colonization of suture material in operative wounds and therefore to prevent SSI, triclosan-coated poliglecaprone 25 suture materials with antibacterial activity will be tested against un-coated suture material for skin closure after open abdominal surgery of 200 patients. The study is planed as a single center, randomized controlled trial. After ethical approval the patients will be consecutively enrolled from 2011 to 2012 in the Department of Visceral Surgery, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The patients will be followed for 30 days (day 3,7 and 30) to detect and document wound complications. Wound complications will be classified according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention Standard guidelines. Data will be collected and the rate of SSI will be analysed in both groups.

Expected value of the proposed project: If the investigators can confirm the proposed hypothesis in our study this could be a promising and feasible approach to lower SSI after open abdominal surgery and might be also used in other surgical fields.

Medical University of Vienna,OTHER,NCT03448679,"Albumin, COP and Endothelial Damage in Patients With ESLD Undergoing OLT","Serum Albumin, Colloid Osmotic Pressure and Endothelial Damage in Patients With End Stage Liver Disease Undergoing Orthotopic Liver Transplantation. A Retrospective Data Analysis.","To study the correlation between colloid osmotic pressure, albumin and the loss of vascular integrity in terms of endothelial dysfunction in patients with ESLD undergoing OLT and its impact on the perioperative course, as well as on morbidity and mortality.","Patients suffering from end-stage liver disease (ESLD) are critically ill. Still, therapeutic options are limited, no organ replacement procedure is available and orthotopic liver transplantation remains the unique therapy of choice.

ESLD is associated with a myriad of comorbidities, and is characterized by imbalances in the acid-base- status, coagulopathy, metabolic disorders and activation of the pro-inflammatory cascade. ESLD represents a state of generalized systemic inflammation subsequently leading to endothelial dysfunction and capillary leak syndrome, potentially culminating in end-organ dysfunction.

Furthermore, patients with ESLD suffer from reduced regenerative and synthetic capacity/ability, which is reflected by the serum albumin deficiency. Serum albumin is the most important plasma protein, is produced exclusively in the liver, and houses various physiological functions: it owns immunological, immuno-modulating and anti-inflammatory properties, transport capacities, as well as detoxifying qualities. However, the most well known property of human serum albumin is maintaining the colloid osmotic pressure (COP). In the healthy individual, serum albumin is responsible for 75% up to 80% of the COP, whereas in the critically ill, the percentage proportion drops down to 17%. The COP itself accounts for the regulation and distribution of the plasma volume and is therefore essential in maintaining the vascular stability and integrity. Additionally, the endothelial glycocalyx is necessary in the context of safeguarding the endothelial function and regulating the vascular permeability. The glycocalyx covers the endothelium luminally and its core component is the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-1. Under various clinical conditions, like ischemia/reperfusion, inflammation, sepsis, shock, major surgery, hypervolemia, degradation to the glycocalyx may happen. These pathophysiological circumstances may lead to loss of the endothelial integrity and consecutively to capillary-leak syndrome causing a loss of albumin and fluid extravasation/shifts. Various clinical and experimental studies could show that global, as well as regional ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion-phase, both lead to glycocalyx-shedding, in terms of increased syndecan-1 plasma levels. Furthermore, a previous study from our study group clearly detected increased syndecan-1 plasma levels in patients with ESLD as surrogate parameter of glycocalyx degradation mirroring the state of chronic inflammation in this patient population.

Nevertheless, a clear correlation between colloid osmotic pressure, albumin and the loss of vascular integrity in state of endothelial dysfunction has not been studied before in patients with ESLD undergoing OLT.","Inclusion Criteria:

Ain Shams University,OTHER,NCT01679379,Wound Infection in Obese Women After Cesarean Delivery,Surgical Site Infection in Obese Women After Cesarean Section; A Randomized Controlled Trial of Absorbable Versus Non Absorbable Sutures for Skin Closure.,The purpose of this study is to determine the surgical site infection rate and patient satisfaction for absorbable versus non absorbable suture in closure of skin at cesarean section in obese women.,"Cesarean section (CS) is the commonest major operation performed on women in the world. Approximately one in 4 women in the United States is delivered by cesarean section, and it is well established that operative abdominal delivery is associated with a significant risk of infection compared with vaginal delivery. These risks are increased with preexisting operative site infection, breaks in sterile technique, prolonged preoperative admissions that may result in colonization with resistant microbes, prolonged operative duration, use of electrocautery, obesity, advanced age, inadequate host immunocompetence.

Obese women may have increased susceptibility to infections because of the effects of obesity on the immune system, skin barriers, wound healing, mobility, and coexisting chronic diseases including diabetes, which could increase infection risk by itself. Cohort studies have shown that women with a body mass index (BMI)\>30kg/m\^2 have a two to three folds increased risk of post cesarean infections, such as wound infection, urinary tract infection UTI), endometritis, or pneumonia, compared with non-obese women. Other studies found that obesity doubled the risk specifically for post-cesarean wound infection.

Wound complications are a major source of morbidity after CS and contribute to prolonged hospital stay and rates of readmission. Age, (BMI), length of incision, and timing of prophylactic antibiotic administration have all been associated with post cesarean surgical site infection (SSI).

A surgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place. SSI can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs, or implanted material. SSI has a great impact on the economy and health care resources. Infection has always been a feature of modern surgery and continues to be a significant problem for health care practitioners across the world.

The ideal skin closure would be safe and effective, associated with minimal patient discomfort, and have a good cosmetic result. It would also be inexpensive and require fewer health care resources by being fast and easy to apply, require minimal follow-up evaluation, and be associated with a low rate of complications.

Methods for closing the skin at the time of cesarean delivery include stainless steel staples, subcuticular absorbable staples, subcuticular suture, adhesive closure strips, and tissue adhesives (cyanoacrylates). Each of the methods has its postulated benefits for wound outcomes; however, none of these have been compared in a prospective trial.

The role of skin closure suture material on wound complication rates in Obstetrics is poorly studied. And when we are talking about obese patients we did not find any recommendation regarding the suture material of skin closure although most of Obstetricians use different sutures materials.

Does closure of skin by absorbable compared to non absorbable suture affect the rate of surgical site infection in obese patients undergoing caesarian section? Our hypothesis is that no difference between absorbable compared to non absorbable suture.","Inclusion Criteria:

For the oral glucocorticoid therapy, we plan to use dexamethasone (dex) 2.5 mg daily. We chose dex for known glycemic effects, improved compliance, and once daily dosing.

Previous studies have shown that in humans, glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance develops within 4 hours with infused drug at high dose (methylprednisolone 500 mg x single infusion) and does not change with duration of drug therapy of up to 3 months.10 Furthermore, more modest doses over a short duration (dex 2.0 mg orally daily x 2 days) have been shown to decrease insulin-mediated glucose disposal.11 12 Thus, studying acute effects of oral dex at 2.5 mg daily x 7 days should be more than adequate to achieve impaired glucose-mediated insulin secretion and impaired insulin-mediated glucose disposal.

In order for sitagliptin to have the desired effect, drug should be administered for at least 7 days (5 half-lives plus 40% more for margin of error). We plan to study subjects with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance as they would likely be candidates for DPP-IV therapy in the future and would be likely to have impaired insulin secretion and impaired glucose disposal amenable to DPP-IV therapy.

The use of eflornithine may be an effective way to prevent the recurrence of or further development of cervical cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of eflornithine in preventing cervical cancer in patients who have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.","OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of eflornithine versus placebo in causing regression in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. II. Compare the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of these treatment regimens in these patients. III. Establish the biochemical tissue markers of DNA content, PCNA, the ras oncogene, EGFR, and keratin and involucrin as intermediate biomarker end points for squamous carcinogenesis in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I-II: Patients receive one of two different doses of oral eflornithine daily. Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo daily. Treatment continues for 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 28 days, and then at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

Douglas Trask,OTHER,NCT00222079,Evaluation of Esomeprazole in Treating Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Exposed to Radiation Therapy,"Pilot Study to Evaluate Esomeprazole (Nexium) in Treating Gastro-esophageal Reflux in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer With Prior External Beam Radiation Therapy: a Randomized, Prospective, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Study.","The purpose of this research study is to measure acid reflux into the throat both before and after medical treatment in people who have had radiation therapy to their head and neck for the treatment of cancer. Many people who have received head and neck radiation therapy develop a dry mouth as a result of the radiation damage to their saliva glands. In addition to the discomfort associated with a dry mouth, the decrease in saliva may increase the severity of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (acid reflux). Acid reflux occurs when acid escapes from your stomach into your throat. You may not have any symptoms of acid reflux, but often it can cause symptoms of heartburn or chest discomfort.

Acid reflux can be treated once it is diagnosed. Treatment consists of dietary changes, behavioral alterations, and medication. Medications are available that decrease the amount of acid in your stomach. Diagnosis of acid reflux is made with a pH-probe to test for acid in your throat.","The annual incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is 40,000 cases per year in the US and 60,000 cases per year in Europe. Radiation therapy is employed in combination with chemotherapy in primary treatment or as adjuvant therapy for over half of patients with SSCHN.

A high incidence of pathologic laryngopharyngeal reflux and gastroesophageal reflux is observed in patients with head and neck cancer. When treatment for the cancer includes radiation therapy, an incidence of 90% has been reported \[2\]. Although the interplay between acid reflux and the development of head and neck cancer remains unclear, there is a strong argument that radiation therapy worsens the problem by muting the body's ability to neutralize acid.

Radiation therapy is extensively used in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Radiation therapy works by exploiting a survival differential between malignant cells and normal cells. Simply stated, the malignant cells are more likely to die with radiation when compared to normal non-malignant cells. However, not all normal cells respond equally and some normal tissues have marked sensitivity to radiation damage. Salivary glands are one such radiosensitive tissue that is permanently destroyed with external-beam radiotherapy.

Damage to salivary tissues by radiation decreases their ability to excrete saliva. This is supported by Olmos et al, who used salivary scintigraphy on both irradiated and non-irradiated patients and found that 84% of those irradiated had total or partial disturbance in both baseline and stimulated function. Of those treated with greater than 4500cGy, salivary excretion was almost invariably impaired. Xerostomia is the term for the dry mouth, which can result from this loss.

In addition to the volume of the saliva, the contents of the saliva are also important. Helm et al. ""...evaluated the properties of human saliva relevant to its potential contribution to esophageal acid clearance."" By measuring the capacity for acid neutralization and plotting titration curves, they identified that saliva and especially its bicarbonate content play an important role in neutralization of esophageal acid in both resting and lozenge-stimulated states.

As saliva plays an active role in the neutralization of esophageal acid and its clearance from the esophagus, loss of saliva is predicted to increase the severity and incidence of reflux as the protective effect of saliva's ability to clear and neutralize acid reflux is diminished. Korsten et al., assessed the effects of chronic xerostomia on parameters of gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis and reported markedly impaired clearance of acid from the esophagus and abnormal 24-hour intra-esophageal pH studies from a cohort of male patients with xerostomia.

Medications are available to increase salivary flow but these are often minimally effective and poorly tolerated. Decreasing stomach acid production is an alternative method of mitigating the effect of GERD in these patients.

The secondary objectives are to correlate the dominant metabolic dependencies of TNBCs with pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy, and with the cancers' molecular signaling pathways assessed via NGS and RPPA.","One of the recognized hallmarks of cancer cells is deregulated cellular metabolism, characterized by enhanced metabolic autonomy compare with non-transformed cells. Tumor cells typically display an overall increase in glucose metabolism, associated with enhanced aerobic glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by a requirement for a high rate of protein, nucleotide, and fatty acid synthesis to provide the raw materials for cell division. 13C-glucose is a non-radioactive stable isotope tracer that has been widely used in vitro, in vivo, and in patients in a variety of disease settings to study glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, at steady state and following intervention. \[1,2-13C\] glucose can provide additional information on the activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway versus glycolysis. Administration of intravenous 13C-glucose is a convenient and affordable approach to analyzing the metabolomics of human cancers in their native microenvironments.

The metabolic dependencies of the various breast cancer subtypes are poorly understood. Importantly, in depth analyses of the in situ metabolic processes utilized by triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) using state-of-the-art in vivo \[1,2-13C\]-glucose infusions in patients with TNBC has never been done. In TNBC, oncogenic activation of key signaling pathways leads to altered metabolic programming resulting in an increased dependence on exogenous nutrients such as glucose and glutamine. These data further suggest a hypothesis that TNBCs may employ a cellular mechanism called macropinocytosis to ingest and degrade interstitial albumin to accumulate glutamine. This process may then be exploited for therapeutic gain through enhanced uptake by cells that utilize macropinocytosis to meet their metabolic requirements.

In this study, administration of \[1,2-13C\]-glucose to patients with TNBC will be done prior to patients undergoing a biopsy of their breast cancer as well as blood sample collection which will allow for in depth evaluation of glycolysis as well as lipid and amino acid metabolism by Joshua Rabinowitz, PhD, at Princeton University who is an international expert in cancer metabolomics.

Headaches are often associated with significant disruptions that can interrupt the patient's usual activities for hours. Although headaches are typically episodic, many individuals with migraine experience life restrictions due to the anticipation of future attacks and the prevalent concern that headaches will compromise their functional capabilities. Several health-related quality of life scales have been developed to assess migraine and its associated conditions. Some examples include the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Quality of Life and Migraine Scale, and the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Measure. While some of these scales have Turkish versions, others do not. Many of these instruments are designed for clinical research, offering comprehensive assessment but are disadvantaged by lengthy completion and scoring times for patients. There is a need for brief health status measures with simple scoring systems that can evaluate the overall impact of migraines on daily activities. The Headache Needs Assessment (HANA) is a seven-item questionnaire developed to assess migraine-related quality of life issues.

This study aims to validate and establish the reliability of the Turkish version of the Headache Needs Assessment for evaluating individuals with migraines. If proven valid and reliable, the Headache Needs Assessment will be a practical tool for assessing the quality of life in individuals with migraines.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The Turkish version of the Headache Needs Assessment is not valid and reliable.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The Turkish version of the Headache Needs Assessment is valid and reliable.","Migraine is a serious health problem that disrupts quality of life and ranks second among primary headaches, affecting over 10% of the general population. In Turkey, the lifetime prevalence of migraine is reported to be 16%, with rates of 10.9% in men and 21.8% in women. Migraine is characterized by episodic attacks that may include headaches accompanied by vomiting, nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia. Chronic migraine is defined as a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month for over three months, with migraine features present on at least 8 of those days. The International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for migraine require only two of four commonly seen pain features; thus, a non-throbbing, bilateral headache can still meet migraine criteria if it is moderate to severe, worsens with physical activity, and is accompanied by migraine-specific symptoms. Neck pain related to stress, which is sometimes associated with tension-type headache, is also a common feature of migraine.

Measurements play a crucial role in scientific research across various fields, including natural sciences, social sciences, and health sciences. In the biomedical sciences, many clinical conditions, psychological behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs are challenging to measure accurately. These may include disease severity, disease-related quality of life, pain perception, anxiety, and more. To quantify and assess specific attributes, researchers develop tools known as ""scales"" that consist of various components. Clinical scales are tools used in medicine to evaluate different aspects of a patient's health, including physical and mental health symptoms, functional abilities, and overall quality of life.

The Headache Needs Assessment (HANA) is designed to assess two dimensions of the chronic impact of migraine-related quality of life issues: frequency and discomfort.

Hence, Magnesium supplementation using magnesium salts could be a good approach to improve the cardiovascular complications, insulin resistance index, lipid profile and kidney function in diabetic nephropathy patients.","Diabetic nephropathy is a serious kidney-related complication of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. It is also called diabetic kidney disease. Up to 40 percent of people with diabetes eventually develop kidney disease. Over time, elevated blood sugar associated with uncontrolled diabetes causes high blood pressure which in turn damages the kidneys by increasing kidney filtration pressure. Complications of diabetic nephropathy include heart and blood vessel disease (cardiovascular disease), fluid retention and hyperkalemia. Magnesium (Mg) is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and the second most important intracellular cation. It plays an essential role in biological systems as co-factor for more than 300 essential enzymatic reactions such as signal transduction, energy metabolism, vascular processes and bone metabolism. Normal serum Mg concentrations ranges from 0.7 to 1.1 mmol/L (1.4-2.0 mEq/L or 1.7-2.4 mg/dL). Outcome studies in the general population have indicated potential associations between low serum Mg levels and atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, and left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as both CVD mortality and all-cause mortality. Low SMg levels (1.4-1.9 mg/dL; 0.58-0.78 mM) were independently associated with all-cause death in patients with prevalent CKD. Higher prevalence of hypomagnesaemia in diabetic patients with nephropathy compared to those without nephropathy. Serum magnesium levels were significantly inversely correlated with serum creatinine and U-A/C ratio, and positively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Magnesium deficiency promotes hydroxyapatite formation and calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells . It is closely related to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. A lower Mg level is directly associated with a faster deterioration of renal function in T2DM patients. Moreover, hypomagnesemia is associated with the long-term micro- and macrovascular complications of T2DM. A dysregulation of mineral metabolism, reflected by altered levels of magnesium and FGF-23, correlates with an increased urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) in type 2 diabetic patients with CKD stages 2-4. Also, a link between hypomagnesemia and atherogenic dyslipidemia alterations exists; a significantly raised total cholesterol and LDL and non-HDL in patients with CKD are observed, suggesting a link to increased cardiovascular risk in CKD patients. Increasing magnesium levels could attenuate the cardiovascular risk derived from hyperphosphatemia, hence the CKD progression. Current literature suggests that Mg may have a protective effect on the CV system. Mg supplementation improves the insulin resistance index and beta-cell function, and decreases hemoglobin A1c levels in type 2 DM patients. In animal models of vascular calcification VC, dietary supplementation with magnesium results in marked reduction in VC and mortality, improved mineral metabolism, including lowering of PTH, as well as improvement in renal function. Hence, Magnesium supplementation using magnesium salts could be a good approach to improve the cardiovascular complications, insulin resistance index, lipid profile and kidney function in diabetic nephropathy patients.","Inclusion Criteria:

Use of topical immunosuppressants has increased in recent years because the topical corticotherapy leads to ocular complications. The most used immunosuppressant is cyclosporine. Tacrolimus , another immunosuppressant, has been used in treatment of immune and inflammatory ocular diseases.This study describes a prospective controlled double-blinded randomized study of the clinical outcome of SS dry eyes patients treated with 0.03% tacrolimus eye drops. As secondary purposes, outcome of dry eye symptoms and any ocular symptoms of the eye drops were also questioned to the patients.","Aqueous deficiency dry eye is mainly caused by Sjogren syndrome (SS), an autoimmune, chronic, inflammatory and systemic disease which affects most commonly the lacrimal and salivary glands. The hyperreactivity of B lymphocytes causes lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, which induces production of antibodies against antigens of the acinar epithelium and ducts of the lacrimal exocrine gland . The ocular treatment is focused in increasing lubrification and decreasing inflammation with topical autologous serum, topical immunosuppressive agents and corticotherapy. Use of topical immunosuppressants has increased in recent years because the topical corticotherapy leads to ocular complications.

Among topical immunosuppressants the most used ones are tacrolimus, also known as FK506 and cyclosporine A (CsA). Their mechanism of action is similar, but FK 506 is described to be 10 to 100 times more potent than CsA. Tacrolimus is a macrolide with immunomodulatory action and becomes biologically active only when it binds to immunophilin and acts by inhibiting calcineurin, limiting transduction of the signal that carries information from the cell membrane to the nucleus, with the aim of stimulating interleukin (IL) - 2 synthesis, and inhibiting T and B lymphocyte activation . Generally, tacrolimus suppresses the immune response by inhibiting the release of other inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, interferon- ϒ, and tumor necrosis factor - α) .

The systemic and topical use of tacrolimus is already well established in ophthalmologic treatments of immune-mediated diseases , uveitis, graft-versus-host disease , corneal transplants and ocular pemphigoid .

University of Florence,OTHER,NCT00670579,Study About Complications of Totally Implanted Venous Access Devices (TIVADs) in People With Cystic Fibrosis (CF),A Prospective Study About Complications of Totally Implantable Central Venous Access Ports in People With CF,"Pulmonary infections are the major cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF); patients frequently have to take antibiotics which often cannot be given orally or by aerosol but have to be administered intravenously. In order to reduce the number of venepunctures, totally implanted venous access devices (TIVAD) or Ports have been used to administer antibiotics and other infusions.

The use of Port systems has been increasing in recent years, especially for those patients requiring frequent intravenous treatments. Having a TIVAD in place makes venous access quicker and also reduces trauma, suffering and pain. However, there are important complications associated with TIVADs which can be early (pneumothorax, arterial puncture, severe bruising) or late (infections, thromboembolic complications and occlusion).

Although the use of TIVADs in CF is increasing, there is little CF-specific literature available on the epidemiology and risk of TIVAD complications. Also, literature is scarce about clinical criteria for deciding to insert a TIVAD. Therefore, so far clinical decisions were based mainly on experiences of TIVAD use in other diseases, such as cancer.

With this prospective observational study we will survey a large population of Italian CF people with TIVAD in order to: collect data about current clinical conditions of CF people with TIVAD; investigate about clinical criteria that led to the decision of positioning a TIVAD; observe the possible onset of late complications.","To be included in the study, subjects need to fulfil the following requirements:

Epacadostat (INCB024360) is an Inhibitor of Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a 403 amino acid cytosolic haem enzyme encoded by the INDO gene on human chromosome 8p22. IDO1 is responsible for the catabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan (trp) to kynurenine (kyn) within immune cells and a subset of tumor cells resulting in inhibition of antitumor cell-mediated immune responses. Increased IDO activity correlates with lower CR rates and shorter OS in AML.

Immunization with 4 melanoma antigen peptides will increase the response rate from 10% to 30%. Administration of low-dose IL-2 following each vaccine will result in a greater than 3-fold increase in specific T cells compared to no IL-2.

Secondary hypotheses: Immunization will clear the blood of detectable circulating melanoma cells. Tumors that grow despite induction of melanoma antigen-specific T cells may lack expression of antigens, class I MHC, or the TAP peptide transporter, or may fail to show increased expression of mRNA for IFN-y or perforin. Tumors that resist vaccination may express a different array of genes than those that are susceptible to vaccination.","Based on the above preclinical and Phase I results, a logical strategy for a second generation melanoma vaccine has emerged. A randomized Phase II study in metastatic melanoma patients will be undertaken. Patients first will be HLA-typed; HLA-A2-positive patients will be eligible for screening. When feasible, each patient will undergo a tumor biopsy to screen for expression of MAGE-3, Melan-A, gplOO, and NAI 7 using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, to determine whether T cells are present in the lesion, to measure cytokine gene expression by RT-PCR, and to perform gene array analysis. In addition, blood cells will be analyzed for certain parameters of T cell function.

Patients will be randomized to cohorts A (no IL-2) or B (with low-dose IL-2). For treatment, peripheral blood will be collected and fractionated by density centrifugation to isolate PBMC as a source of APC. The PBMC will be divided into four pools, each of which will be incubated with one of the following peptides: MAGE-3, Melan-A, gp 100, or Ni 7A. The peptide-loaded cells will then be washed and recombined into a single suspension in PBS, and lethally irradiated. Approximately 120 x 106 pulsed cells will be injected subcutaneously at a site near a lymph node not thought to be involved with tumor. The subcutaneous route has been selected for the reasons of safety, efficacy in the preclinical model, and the goal of targeting the vaccine to a draining lymph node. rhIL-12 (4 .tg straight dose) will then be given subcutaneously adjacent to the vaccine site days 1,3, and 5 of each cycle. This dose and schedule was found to be effective in our phase I study. In one-half of the patients (cohort B), IL-2 (I MU straight dose) will be administered subcutaneously daily, days 7-18. Re-immunization along with rhIL-12 followed by IL-2 (if assigned) will be performed at 3 week intervals as in cycle I.

On day 1 of each cycle, peripheral blood will be collected to measure peptide-specific IFN-y production. Before treatment and after every 3 cycles, PBMC will be collected to quantify peptide specific CD8 T cells by flow cytometric analysis with peptide/HLA-A2 tetramers, and evidence for a molecular response will be assessed by performing RT-PCR. for melanoma antigens on peripheral blood samples. In addition, prior to treatment, after the first 3 cycles, and at the time of going off- study, a tumor biopsy will be performed to assess the immune response in the tumor microenvironment, including gene array analysis. It is hoped that these studies will uncover the reason for lack of clinical response in patients with residual tumors. Clinical response will be assessed as a secondary outcome.","Inclusion Criteria:

"University of California, San Francisco",OTHER,NCT05158179,Assessment of Laryngopharyngeal Sensation in Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia,Assessment of Laryngopharyngeal Sensation in Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia,"Study investigators have completed a study testing laryngopharyngeal sensation at specific laryngopharyngeal subsites using a novel buckling force aesthesiometer in a series of 22 healthy adults at this institution. Investigators would like to use the same device apparatus to evaluate laryngopharyngeal sensation in patients with laryngopharyngeal disorders, such as adductor spasmodic dysphonia. This study will use a tested laryngopharyngeal aesthesiometer to examine laryngeal sensation using calibrated tactile stimuli to determine differences in somatotopic perceptual strength maps of laryngopharyngeal structures between patients with laryngopharyngeal disorders and healthy controls.","Participant Recruitment Subjects with adductor type LD (AdLD) were identified and recruited by advertisements and by study clinicians at their institution. Advertisements were physically placed in the UCSF Voice and Swallowing Center clinic and were delivered electronically through the website of the National Spasmodic Dysphonia Association and to area LD (""spasmodic dysphonia"") support groups.

Adults greater than 18 years old with AdLD were included if they received a diagnosis established by a multi-disciplinary evaluation by a fellowship-trained laryngologist and voice-specialized speech-language pathologist. Subjects diagnosed by a physician outside of the study facility were evaluated in-person by a fellowship-trained laryngologist to confirm their eligibility for this study. All patients were required to have history of favorable response to intra-laryngeal botulinum toxin A (BtxA) treatment, as further demonstration of the correct diagnosis of ADLD. This was especially helpful for patients initially diagnosed outside of our center. Subjects with abductor or mixed type LD were not included in the present study due to their low incidence, but concurrent essential tremor (ET) of the vocal tract was accepted.

Patients were also excluded if they had a history of: concurrent laryngeal diseases or conditions other than AdLD+/-ET; bleeding disorder or current anticoagulation use; head and neck radiation; active tobacco use; or drinking more than two alcoholic beverages per day. If laryngopharyngeal lesions and/or masses, impeding abnormal laryngopharyngeal structure(s), or excessive post-nasal drip were noted on laryngoscopy, then examination ceased, and patients were excluded. Prior to testing, subjects also completed symptom-specific patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), including: Reflux Symptom Index (RSI),18 Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10),19 Dyspnea Index (DI),20 Cough Severity Index (CSI),21 and Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10).22 These PROMs are standardly collected as part of the routine clinical are for all patients undergoing evaluation at this center and are reported herein for holistic characterization of these subjects but not intended as a reflection or measure of the severity of their AdLD. Lastly, to avoid any potentially confounding physical effects from the injection (e.g., vocal fold edema), no testing was performed in the two weeks immediately following BtxA treatment. For patient convenience and to facilitate maximal enrollment, patients were allowed to undergo testing at any point outside of this post-injection window, although the majority pursued testing immediately prior to a BtxA injection on the same day.

Healthy controls were defined as adults between 18 and 85 years of age without laryngopharyngeal disease and were subject to the same screening and exclusion criteria.23 Additionally, controls were excluded if they had abnormal patient reported outcome measures (i.e. Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score\> 13, Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) score\>2, or Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) score\> 11).

Aesthesiometer Device As outlined in previous work, modified nylon monofilaments fixed to the end of 5-French open lumen catheters were utilized to deliver tactile stimuli to laryngopharyngeal subsites.12 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously ruled the aesthesiometer to be a Nonsignificant Risk (NSR) Device Study (Q190371/S001). Three nylon monofilament sizes (6-0, 5-0, 4-0) were cut to a calibrated length of 30 mm to deliver three distinct tactile stimuli of increasing strength, known as buckling-force. The 6-0, 5-0, and 4-0 monofilaments deliver an increasing mean force of 0.03 g, 0.11 g, and 0.30 g, respectively.12 An intermediary strength ""4.5-0"" monofilament was created by using a 5-0 monofilament of 25mm length, which has been demonstrated to have a mean buckling force of 0.19 g.23 During testing, the monofilaments were passed through the working channel of a flexible ENF-VT2 laryngoscope (Olympus America, Inc., Center Valley, PA) to allow for direct visualization and concurrent stimulation of laryngopharyngeal subsites.

Laryngopharyngeal Sensory Evaluation All subjects underwent a standard protocol for laryngopharyngeal sensory evaluation. This has been described in detail previously but briefly reviewed again here.12,13 Prior to testing, subjects were screened for any recent changes in conditions affecting voice and swallowing to ascertain subjects-maintained inclusion criteria. Three investigators executed laryngopharyngeal testing: 1) one to operate the laryngoscope; 2) one to maneuver the aesthesiometer monofilament; and 3) one to monitor testing, record subjective patient response, and observe cough/gag/swallow responses.

An investigator then examined both nasal passageways with a nasal speculum, selecting the more patent pathway for laryngoscope insertion. The more patent nasal passageway was topically anesthetized with cottonoid pledgets soaked in a 50/50 mixture of 4% lidocaine hydrochloride and neosynephrine. The cottonoid pledgets were compressed to remove excess liquid to avoid unintentional spillage posteriorly to the nasopharynx and potentially larynx, and left in place for five minutes.

The channeled laryngoscope was then inserted along the inferior meatus towards the posterior nasopharyngeal wall. The 6-0 monofilament was pressed against the posterior nasopharyngeal wall and swiftly removed to establish a perceptual strength of ""1"". If subjects were insensate to this stimulation, monofilament size was incrementally increased (i.e., 5-0, 4.5-0, and 4-0) until the stimulus was perceived, to establish this internal anchor. As per the validated, standardized protocol, all AdLD participants were stimulated on the left, allowing maximal visualization of the vocal folds during testing due to camera configuration of the flexible laryngoscope. Only four controls were stimulated on the right side, during earliest phases of testing.

Starting with the 6-0 monofilament, the lateral pyriform sinus (LPS) was presented with the planned stimulus, followed by the aryepiglottic fold (AEF) and the false vocal folds (FVF). (Figure 1) Participants were instructed to raise their hand when the stimulus was detected, and then were asked by the study team to report a perceptual strength ""score,"" in comparison to the nasopharyngeal anchor strength of 1. LAR response was observed and recorded by the study team. A negative response was defined as a lack of LAR to two appropriate stimuli. Gag or cough response to stimuli delivery were also recorded, assuming a positive LAR during these observations.

The LPS and AEF were tested in order of increasing stimulus: 5-0, 4.5-0 and 4-0 monofilaments. The false vocal folds (FVF) were tested last, in the same order of increasing monofilament strength. Testing of FVF terminated after the first observed LAR given site sensitivity, assuming positive responses would also be present for increased monofilament strength.

LAR Assessment Confirmation of LAR was determined using post-hoc frame-by-frame analysis of video recordings. Unilateral or bilateral vocal fold adduction following stimulus delivery was recorded as a positive response. Upon review, stimuli were excluded if they did not produce 10-30% monofilament buckling (as observed by the reviewer), were entrapped by saliva, or could not compress orthogonally to the mucosal surface. Additionally, if line of sight of visualization of vocal fold adduction was obstructed or confounded by phonation, the stimuli were excluded. All stimuli were reviewed by one study investigator with 30% of stimuli reviewed by a blinded second reviewer. Disagreements were reconciled by a blinded third reviewer.","Inclusion Criteria:

In the neonatal population, infants with history of intestinal resection and short bowel syndrome are at increased risk for this disease. The investigators plan to compare two possible lipid dosing preventative strategies including a composite, fish oil lipid and soy-based lipid reduction. Intestinal failure associated liver disease (IFALD) is a cholestatic liver disease associated with prolonged need for parenteral nutrition. This disease can lead to such serious complications as liver failure and need for transplantation. In the neonatal population, short bowel syndrome, due to intestinal resection, is the most common cause of intestinal failure. While the exact cause is yet to be determined, it is felt the lipid component of parenteral nutrition is a large contributor to the development of this disease. Currently, there is no standard preventative strategy to attempt to decrease the risk of IFALD in the high risk, post-surgical neonatal population. The investigators aim to complete a randomized trial comparing two possible preventative strategies. One group will receive a composite lipid containing fish oil (Smoflipid) and the other group will receive soy-based lipid at reduced dosing. Inclusion Criteria: Neonates with anticipated need for parenteral nutrition (based on primary physicians opinion) for greater than or equal to four weeks and one of the following diagnoses: * Anatomic: Neonate with intestinal atresia, omphalocele, gastroschisis, or volvulus with or without intestinal resection. * Ischemic/perforation: Neonates with spontaneous intestinal perforation or necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgical intervention.

The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and anti-cancer activity of various doses and repeated cycles of the experimental treatment using the study drug RM-1929 and fixed amounts of red light applied at the tumor site to activate the pharmacodynamics of the drug.

The part 1 of the study has been completed and consisted in a single cycle, 3+3 dose escalation safety study of the experimental drug RM-1929 using a fixed amount of 690 nm red light. The part 1 was designed to determine the safety of the treatment as set by the maximal feasible dose or the maximal tolerable dose of RM-1929. From the part 1 results, the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929 was determined.

The part 2 of the study is currently ongoing and it is evaluating the safety and anticancer efficacy of up to four repeated treatments of Photoimmunotherapy with RM-1929 at the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929 activated with a fixed amount of red light.","Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is a new cancer targeted technology invented at the National Cancer Institute, USA. This clinical study evaluates the treatment of the experimental drug RM-1929 with Photoimmunotherapy (PIT).

The experimental drug, RM-1929, is a parental formulation consisting of a chemical conjugate of the dye IR700 with the FDA approved antibody, Erbitux® (Cetuximab), that targets EGFR receptors (EGFR is a cancer expressed protein, a cancer antigen). EGFR is highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC). It is expected that systemic administration of RM-1929 will lead to tumor accumulation and binding to EGFR expressed at cancer cells. It is expected that treatment with RM-1929 and Photoimmunotherapy can lead to the selective destruction of the HNSCC cancer cells and provide an effective therapy to manage the disease.

The treatment using RM-1929 with Photoimmunotherapy requires two steps:

(i) the administration by infusion of the drug RM-1929 targeting the cancer protein EGFR

AND

(ii) the illumination of the tumor with red light (690 nm) using sufficient energy to activate the drug and induce cancer cell killing.

Light illumination is applied at 24 h post drug infusion to enable sufficient time for the drug to distribute in the tumor after administration. Cell killing occurs only at cancer cells expressing the protein EGFR that is bound to the drug RM-1929. The requirement of binding of the drug to EGFR of cancer cells enables the selective destruction of cancer cells with minimum damage of healthy tissue surrounding the tumor cells. Preclinical pharmacology demonstrated that light-induced activation of RM-1929 elicits rapid tumor destruction of human cancer xenografts implanted in mice and that the treatment is cancer specific.

The Part 1 study has been completed and consisted of a single cycle 3+3 dose escalation study of RM-1929 to determine the safety of the treatment and the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929. From the part 1 of this study, the maximal feasible dose for treatment with RM-1929 was selected. The currently ongoing Part 2 of the clinical study is evaluating the safety and anti-cancer activity of up to 4 repeat treatment cycles of Photoimmunotherapy with RM-1929.","Inclusion Criteria:

Patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible for study participation:

The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and anti-cancer activity of various doses and repeated cycles of the experimental treatment using the study drug RM-1929 and fixed amounts of red light applied at the tumor site to activate the pharmacodynamics of the drug. The part 1 of the study has been completed and consisted in a single cycle, 3+3 dose escalation safety study of the experimental drug RM-1929 using a fixed amount of 690 nm red light. The part 1 was designed to determine the safety of the treatment as set by the maximal feasible dose or the maximal tolerable dose of RM-1929. From the part 1 results, the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929 was determined. The part 2 of the study is currently ongoing and it is evaluating the safety and anticancer efficacy of up to four repeated treatments of Photoimmunotherapy with RM-1929 at the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929 activated with a fixed amount of red light. Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) is a new cancer targeted technology invented at the National Cancer Institute, USA. This clinical study evaluates the treatment of the experimental drug RM-1929 with Photoimmunotherapy (PIT). The experimental drug, RM-1929, is a parental formulation consisting of a chemical conjugate of the dye IR700 with the FDA approved antibody, Erbitux® (Cetuximab), that targets EGFR receptors (EGFR is a cancer expressed protein, a cancer antigen). EGFR is highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC). It is expected that systemic administration of RM-1929 will lead to tumor accumulation and binding to EGFR expressed at cancer cells. It is expected that treatment with RM-1929 and Photoimmunotherapy can lead to the selective destruction of the HNSCC cancer cells and provide an effective therapy to manage the disease. The treatment using RM-1929 with Photoimmunotherapy requires two steps: (i) the administration by infusion of the drug RM-1929 targeting the cancer protein EGFR AND (ii) the illumination of the tumor with red light (690 nm) using sufficient energy to activate the drug and induce cancer cell killing. Light illumination is applied at 24 h post drug infusion to enable sufficient time for the drug to distribute in the tumor after administration. Cell killing occurs only at cancer cells expressing the protein EGFR that is bound to the drug RM-1929. The requirement of binding of the drug to EGFR of cancer cells enables the selective destruction of cancer cells with minimum damage of healthy tissue surrounding the tumor cells. Preclinical pharmacology demonstrated that light-induced activation of RM-1929 elicits rapid tumor destruction of human cancer xenografts implanted in mice and that the treatment is cancer specific. The Part 1 study has been completed and consisted of a single cycle 3+3 dose escalation study of RM-1929 to determine the safety of the treatment and the maximal feasible dose of RM-1929. From the part 1 of this study, the maximal feasible dose for treatment with RM-1929 was selected. The currently ongoing Part 2 of the clinical study is evaluating the safety and anti-cancer activity of up to 4 repeat treatment cycles of Photoimmunotherapy with RM-1929.

Nantes University Hospital,OTHER,NCT05042479,Using of Virtual Reality to Relieve Procedural Pain in Pediatric Oncology.,Using of Virtual Reality to Relieve Procedural Pain in Pediatric Oncology.,"Medical procedures can be a very frightening experience for children. It is known that children who received painful medical procedures can develop a higher sensitivity of pain during their following experiences.

During their treatments for malignant diseases, children are exposed to a lot of painful procedures (eg. needle insertion, lumbar punction, myelogram, etc...)

Therefore, medical societies propose the use of interventions like distraction techniques for pain management in complement of pharmacological treatment.

In addition, the repetitions of painful procedures and ineffective prevention of pain can create care phobia.

Within this context, immersive and participative virtual reality (VR) could be an innovative distraction technique for pain management among children undergoing medical procedures.

Attention Pain Theory can explain how virtual reality can reduce the perception of pain. Attention is required to feel pain. When the patient is focused on another subject like an immersive virtual environment, his brain is less available to treat information like painful stimulus from care procedures.

The investigators hypothesis is that VR can reduce procedural-related pain and can decrease fear during the following procedures.

Results of previous studies are varied : some showed a non-significant reduction of patient's procedural pain despite the use of VR, whereas others concluded to a decrease of pain. The question of the benefit of VR for the patients who are exposed to repeated painful procedures remains still unclear, especially with patients who are likely to feel chronic pain or many pain-related exposures.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of virtual reality as a distraction technique for pain management in children and adolescents with onco-hematological diseases, undergoing painful procedures, compared to standard of care.","VIRTUOSO is a study that aims to evaluate the impact of using a virtual reality headset to prevent care-induced pain in pediatric oncology. This study plans to include 34 patients. It is a single-center, non-inferiority, controlled, with cross-over study.

Efficiency of VR will be evaluated for each patient across 3 potentially painful care-procedures :

For the first treatment, the child will benefit usual distraction and pain prevention techniques.

For the 2nd treatment, the child will use a VR headset as well as pain prevention techniques (excluding oxygen-nitrous oxide mixtures). The child will choose the application he/she wishes to use according to his/her age.

For the 3rd treatment, the child will choose his/her favorite technique.

The virtual reality headset is an Occulus Quest headset, composed of 2 integrated earphones. It is adapted to the environment and can be used sitting or standing.

Usual pharmacological techniques for pain prevention will be maintained as per local practice.

All concomitant treatments are authorized except the use of oxygen-nitrous oxide mixtures.

The duration of this study is approximately 20 months. Inclusion will be for 10 months, patient follow-up for 6 months. Data analysis will be performed during 4 months.

During each treatment, if the child wishes to stop VR, the helmet will be removed and the usual techniques will be offered.

After each procedure, a self-assessment of the pain will be done immediately, using VAS.

At the end of the third treatment, a short questionnaire will be proposed to the child in order to collect the reasons for his choice. Another questionnaire will also be proposed to the parent present during the care.
