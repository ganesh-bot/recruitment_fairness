Baptist Health South Florida,OTHER,NCT04684979,Transplantation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells From HLA-compatible Donors in Patients With B-Cell Lymphoid Malignancies,A Non-Myeloablative Conditioning Regimen With Peri-Transplant Rituximab and the Transplantation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells From HLA-compatible Related or Unrelated Donors in Patients With B-Cell Lymphoid Malignancies,"This research study is being conducted to treat patients with B-cell lymphoid malignancies. These types of cancers include diffuse large cell (DLBCL) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), mantle cell NHL, any indolent B cell NHL (such as follicular, small cell or marginal zone NHL), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with these types of lymphomas have been shown to benefit from peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). PBSCT uses healthy blood stem cells from a donor to replace your diseased or damaged bone marrow. Before undergoing PBSCT, you'll receive chemotherapy and/or radiation to destroy your diseased cells and prepare your body for the donor cells. This is called a ""conditioning regimen."" Non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning causes minimal cell death. This research study will look at a course of treatment using NMA conditioning regimen including low dose chemotherapy and low dose radiation as well as rituximab and PBSCT from a compatible donor. The primary aim is to obtain a preliminary estimate of the overall and event-free survival 1 year post-transplant after NMA.","This is a phase 2 study of a treatment regimen consisting of a non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimen incorporating low dose chemotherapy and low dose radiation as well as peri-transplant Rituximab and the transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) from an HLA compatible related or unrelated donor in patients with B cell lymphoid malignancies including diffuse large cell (DLBCLC) and mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (MCL), indolent B cell NHL, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study design will be based on a total of 90 patients, 30 recipients of related matched and 60 recipients of mismatched related or unrelated PBSCT.

It is anticipated that the accrual will last 5-6 years. At the conclusion of the study, the safety and a preliminary assessment of efficacy of NMA PBSCT will be determined. The treatment will be declared efficacious if the disease-free survival at 1 year in this patient population is at least 50%.","Inclusion Criteria:

Grupo Cooperativo de Estudio y Tratamiento de las Leucemias Agudas y Mielodisplasias,OTHER,NCT01698879,Prospective Study of Mylotarg and G-CSF in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment,"Treatment of de Novo Acute Myeloid Leukemia With the Combination of Idarubicin, Cytarabine, and Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (Mylotarg ®), Associated or Not Priming With G-CSF. Prospective Study of Efficacy and Toxicity","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a neoplasm of immature hematopoietic cells (blasts) with altered ripening capacity. Due to excessive proliferation, the blasts displace normal hematopoietic cells and bone marrow failure appears. Leukemic cells also infiltrate extramedullary tissues.

Following the standard chemotherapy treatment, the CR rate achieved is around 65-75% for all patients and 15% lower when considering only patients over 65 years. Modifications to the standard regimen consist of replacing the DNR for a cytotoxic one, modifying the dose of ara-C or adding a third drug.

Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg ®) is an immunoconjugate between anti-CD33 antibody and a cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic, calicheamicin. Mylotarg ® antibody specifically binds to CD33, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein expressed in over 90% of LMA10. Mylotarg ® selectively transports the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin into leukemic cells and hematopoietic progenitors differentiated from the myelomonocytic line, while respecting the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. Calicheamicin is released only after the fixation of the antibody anti-CD33 and its internalization by the cell, after which binds to and damages the DNA.

Mylotarg ® is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of CD33 positive AML in first relapse, for patients older than 60 years non-candidates for other intensive treatment modalities.

Since the efficacy of Mylotarg ® is equivalent and its toxicity profile less than the conventional therapy, it is logical to conduct a phase II trial exploring the role of Mylotarg ® in the early stages of treatment of AML.

Previous experience with gemtuzumab ozogamicin in relapsed patients led to its use combined with induction chemotherapy. The aim was to improve the CR rate reached with the latter and reduce relapse after achieving greater leukemic cytoreduction.

Recent data from the HOVON group support that the administration of G-CSF before and during induction chemotherapy decreases the incidence of relapse in patients with AML, particularly those considered to have intermediate risk.

Everything mentioned above justifies to investigate the combination of GO combined with chemotherapy with IDR and ara-C in standard 3x7 scheme and analyze the effect of sensitization with G-CSF in patients with AML de novo. If the treatment proposed here is effective and presents an acceptable toxicity it should be investigated.",,"Inclusion Criteria:

In HIV-infected patients with KS in developed settings, the initiation of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has been associated with regression of the tumor, in many but not all cases, even in the absence of conventional chemotherapy. However, it is not known which specific antiretroviral drugs or regimens are critical to convey HAART's anti-KS effect. In particular, it is not known whether the anti-KS effects of protease inhibitors (PI) in vitro and in animal models translate into improved clinical outcomes as compared to non-PI-based HAART regimens. To address this, we will determine whether a PI-based HAART regimen (lopinavir/ritonavir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir) is superior to a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based HAART regimen (efavirenz plus emtricitabine/tenofovir) in promoting the regression of KS tumor burden in persons with AIDS-related KS in sub-Saharan Africa.

In some individuals who receive a blood transfusion, white blood cells from the donor's blood may remain in the body for years, a condition known as microchimerism. This study will evaluate the occurrence of microchimerism among the following three groups of individuals who previously received transfusions: 1) individuals with traumatic injuries; 2) individuals with burn injuries; and 3) individuals who underwent elective orthopedic operations.","Approximately 10% to 15% of injured patients who receive blood transfusions experience a condition known as transfusion-associated microchimerism.

One of the main indicators of success is they have excellent physical fitness. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of an intervention program by comparing the results of (intervention) intervention groups, namely the effect of physical exercise interventions (endurance exercise) measured before and after the intervention. This research is an intervention study, and I understand that the process of taking blood can occur with fear, pain due to being pricked by a needle, can faint or be infected. However, previous blood pressure tests, sterile collection techniques and performed by experts, are very unlikely to cause side effects.","The investigators invite all Indonesian Hajj Health Officers candidates to participate in research on physical fitness (VO2max) which is an important part of providing Hajj health services in Saudi Arabia while they are on duty. I was involved in the RT-PCR examination and physical fitness test (VO2max) that was carried out before the intervention program and was briefed on the examination protocol before being tested. The consent form was given to me first to be handled. I was informed about the intervention process and the purpose of the research, as well as the confidentiality of the data, collected. And it was also stated that I would be allowed to withdraw from the research at any time without pressure and coercion from any party. The procedure investigators will do is take samples from prospective Indonesian Hajj Health Officers undergoing a series of anamneses and physical examinations by doctors, in the form of personal data, physical activities, general physical examinations including TB, BB, HR, RR, then performed the physical activity eligibility forms. Next, a 1 ml blood sample is taken into a purple test tube containing EDTA to prevent lysis. The blood sample is taken to the HUM-RC Makassar Biomolecular Biology laboratory and stored in a frozen cupboard, after which an initial physical fitness measurement (VO2max) test is carried out using the Multi Fitness Test (MFT) or Bleep Test to PRE TEST at the Health Training Center (Health Training Center) BBPK) Makassar, followed by running exercises intervention as far as 1600 meters 3 times a week duration of 20-30 each training session with a frequency of exercise 16 times 5 weeks according to a predetermined schedule, then conducted a physical fitness test (VO2max) using the same method when PRE TEST to POST TEST I, followed by 1 ml blood sampling at Sudiang Embarkation Hajj Makassar, then 1 week later physical fitness test (VO2max) to POST TEST II without blood sampling is taken again.

Participants (n = 30), measured physical fitness level (VO2max) using the Multistage Fitness Test (MFT) Bleep Test (level and feedback) method before being given intervention (pre-exercise), after that given a running intervention 1600 meters duration 20 -30 minutes each training session 3 times a week with a frequency of exercise16 times for 5 weeks, then physical fitness measurements (VO2max) → (post-exercise 1), then intermittent 1-week duration of physical fitness measurements (VO2max) again without intervention and blood sampling (post-exercise 2).

Participants only joined in one group will be given intervention for 5 weeks in the form of running 1600 meters duration of 20-30 minutes 3 times a week. It is important for the participants as well as for us to know which training methods are given. this information will be documented in our file, but the investigators will not see these files until after the research is complete. this is the best way the investigators have for testing without being influenced by what the investigators think or expect might happen.

The doctor in charge of research will always look after the participants very carefully during the study. If the investigators are worried about what is done, the investigators will find out how the level of physical fitness that participants get and make changes. If there is something the participant is worried about or is disturbing the Participant about the research, please talk to me or one of the other researchers.

In this study, the investigators did not use a placebo term, but the investigators still explained to participants in the world of research that the term placebo is known as clinical trials or interventions given to participants that are not genuine but fake. For good research, participants mustn't know whether the participants have been properly measured according to the criteria or not. This is one of the best ways the investigators have to find out what level of physical fitness the investigators are testing. No side effects might occur because the previous sample was very rigorously selected through analysis, physical examination and physical activity feasibility testing. If Participants find that Our interventions are very uncomfortable for participants, the investigators can use other exercise options more comfortably according to the available exercise choices.

The possibility of danger, risk, or side effects in this study is very small because the selection of samples is done very closely starting with anamnesis and head-to-toe physical examination and continued with a physical activity feasibility test (PAR-Q). If the physical fitness test occurs when there is suffocation, the researcher has prepared 2 medical staff who accompanied the subjects during the physical fitness test and also in this study the investigators prepared 2 clinics namely the Makassar BBPK Health Clinic which was used during the physical fitness pre-test and the Clinic Musytasyfa Health Makassar Haji Sudiang Dormitory that was used at the time of physical fitness post-test.

Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla,OTHER,NCT04011579,Pilates Training in Multiple Sclerosis,Multiple Sclerosis Fitness Intervention Training With Pilates Exercises,"To date, despite recent advances in MS care including rehabilitation interventions, many PwMS are unable to access these developments due to limited mobility, fatigue and related issues, and costs associated with travel.

Thus, physical activity at home could be a new way to deliver exercises to the patients. Although Pilates did not show any significant advantage over standardized physical therapy in the current literature, it is a good method to promote physical activity, sensorimotor integration and cognitive stimulation. Thus, it could be a treatment option to improve fatigue, balance and walking abilities in PwMS; consequently, Pilates could be suggested by the clinician as a physical activity to be integrated in the daily life.

This possibility could be made more feasible using new tools such as those offered by low cost devices.

The main MS-FIT project purposes are to provide and to test a tool based on serious game concept of Pilates-inspired exercises for daily use at home, by mixing the entertainment aspects typical of the videogames and the possibility to perform physical activity.

The MS-FIT tool does not pursue therapeutic aims as rehabilitation does, but it could have a positive impact on prevention and health in MS.

MS-FIT, by using the Microsoft Kinect Motion Controller Xbox or similar to deliver adapted physical activity, offers the possibility to transform the Pilates exercises into a virtual reality game.

MS-FIT, through a multicentre approach, would provide:

* a feasibility study in order to:

  * refine the tool for the final customized version to be used in a RCT MS study
  * assess the tool for PwMS in terms of technology acceptability and satisfaction-to-use
  * assess the process of recruitment, the adherence to the intervention, the dropout rate and identify potential issues
  * assess human resources necessary for the RCT
  * estimate the effect of the intervention and its variance necessary to calculate the appropriate sample size for the RCT
* a RCT study in order to evaluate the effect of a physical activity intervention of exercises inspired to Pilates self-managed at home in terms on PwMS","Devices and technologies for at-home interventions could provide to PwMS with mild disability useful tools to successfully maintain own physical, cognitive and emotional status by performing at-home physical activity/exercises and avoiding outpatient interventions. Together, new devices and technologies could help in overcoming all barriers (i.e. transportations, working time, etc.) hindering the adherence to and, consequently, efficacy of the outpatient treatments.

MS-FIT, through a multicentre approach, would provide:

* Feasibility study
* RCT study

All the 14 participating centres will select a dedicated therapist who will be responsible for patient training in using the MS-FIT tool.

All the subjects recruited following the inclusion/exclusion criteria will sign an informed consent and all the procedures (feasibility and RCT) will be in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and approved by Local Ethical Committee.

No trial-specific procedures will be conducted before informed consent has been obtained, and participants will be reminded that they may withdraw from the trial at any time without it affecting the quality of their care in the future.

Participants with relapses during the period of their involvement in the project will be considered as drop out and will be considered in the analysis for the entire period of study participation.

Feasibility study

Primary objective:

• the refinement of the tool for the final customized version to be used in a RCT MS study. The primary objective will be reached by fixing eventual bugs relieved during the feasibility study and taking into account results from the assessment in terms of technology acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety and the physical effects of the intervention.

Secondary Objectives:

* the estimation of human resources necessary for the RCT.
* the estimation of the effect of the intervention and its variance necessary to calculate the appropriate sample size for the RCT.

Due to the nature of the feasibility study and based on previous literature showing that a sample size of 25-40 subjects per arm is adequate for a feasibility trial, the investigators will recruit 28 PwMS per arm. All the 14 participating centres will recruit a total of 56 recruited patients following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the range of EDSS inclusion criteria 28 subjects will be recruited with lower disability (EDSS 2-3) and 28 with higher disability (EDSS of 3.5 or 4). For both levels the subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITFeas (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLFeas (""unspecific physical activities""). Randomization will be provided by an independent randomization service at FISM accessed via a web-based system, using computer-based block randomization (1 factor: EDSS score 2-3 and 3.5-4). Patient will be allocated to MSFITFeas and CTRLFeas in a 1:1 ratio. Confirmation emails will be sent to Centres PI.

The MSFITFeas group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 6 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 6 weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 6 weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home.

The protocol for the Feasibility study will consist on (Figure 2):

* T0 evaluation (PRE)
* 6 weeks of intervention

  * MSFITFeas: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home
  * CTRLFeas: unspecific physical activities
* T1 evaluation (POST)

The evaluation for the Feasibility study are described in the section Outcome Measures.

Deliverables Deliverables of the Feasibility study will be the final customized tool, a set of indications for the management of the RCT, the sample size estimation for the RCT.

Focus group A nested qualitative study on 14 participants will explore patients' experiences of MS-FIT via Focus Group Meeting (FGM). The objectives are to provide insight into the quantitative results, explore strengths and limitations of the intervention with MS-FIT, so as to guide the RCT.

The report of each FGM analysis will be submitted to FGM participants for review (respondent validation).

Deliverables Deliverables of the nested qualitative study will be the delivery of the report of the FGM analysis.

RCT study

Primary Objective:

• evaluation of the change in TUG.

Secondary Objectives:

* evaluation of the physical effects also in terms of self-reported outcome, upper limb performances, resistance in walking and physical activity, cognitive and psychosocial effects, quality of life and wellbeing. Differences in physical and cognitive performances due to the genetic features will be evaluated also considering subgroups identified through the polymorphism analysis.
* evaluation of the acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety through the measurements of endpoint already listed for the Feasibility study.

The RCT sample size will be definitively calculated based on the results from the feasibility study. However, by considering the literature about Pilates in MS, the investigators can preliminary estimate the needed sample size. In particular, the investigators refer to the TUG post-intervention improvement found by Karlon et al. in a group of PwMS performing Pilates. For our aim, the investigators can consider this result even if no differences between Pilates group and control group (Physiotherapy) were found. Pilates group improved the performance in TUG of about 1.8s, that could be considered as clinically relevant for PwMS. By considering a variability of about 3.4s, a power of 80%, a level of significance (two sided) of 5% and a potential loss of 15% of patients at follow-up, the estimation of the necessary sample size consists of approximately 63 subjects for the experimental group (a total of 126).

All the 14 participating centres will be involved in the patients' enrolment. The subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITRCT (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLRCT (""unspecific physical activities""). The randomization will be carried out using a web based procedure and will be centrally managed. A stratified minimization/adaptive algorithm will be used in order to balance the baseline EDSS (2-3 vs 3.5-4) factors across the two groups.

The MSFITRCT group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 12 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. The follow-up (FU) evaluation will be after 6 weeks since the end of the intervention. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home.

At the end of the 18 weeks, the participants of the CTRLRCT group will be offered the MS-FIT intervention.

The requirement that the enrolled patients will have not to perform any supervised physical activity or rehabilitative intervention is in line with recent studies showing that most of PwMS with mild disability (78.34% EDSS \<4) were not treated with rehabilitation.

The subjects involved in the feasibility study will be excluded from the RCT study in order to avoid bias effects.

The protocol design for the RCT study will consist on (Figure 3):

* T0 evaluation (PRE)
* 12 weeks of intervention

  * MSFITRCT: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home
  * CTRLRCT: unspecific physical activities
* T1 evaluation (POST)
* T2 evaluation (FU) - after 6 weeks from T1

The evaluation for the RCT study are described in the section Outcome Measures. Moreover, blood samples will be collected at T0 to investigate if genetic polymorphisms of candidate regulators of neuronal plasticity could be correlated to the response to the proposed protocol. According to previous report MS subjects of the two RCT groups could be subdivided in subgroups with respect to the polymorphism features. For example, for the CNR1 gene the subdivision could be based on the number of AAT repetitions (short AAT: homozygous or heterozygous for allele with ≤11 repeats of AAT triplets; long AAT: homozygous for allele with ≥12 repeats of AAT triplets).

Differences among subgroups in terms of physical and cognitive performances will be evaluated.

In particular, all patients will be genotyped for a total of 55 genetic polymorphisms of 23 potential regulators, like: Homer1; AKT1; RAPTOR; D2R; GAPD; CHAT; p53; BRCA2; LIG4; XRCC5; CYP3A4; NBS1; MDM2; CNR1, ATTn; CNR2; GRIN1; GRIN2B; TRPV1; FAAH, COMPT; (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) BDNF.

Blood sample will be assessed from participants early in the morning after awakening (8h). To synchronize the sample for lifestyle variables, subjects were requested to avoid excessive physical activity the last three days before the blood sampling, sleep for 7-8h the night before study, avoid starving, and eat a usual breakfast in the morning (approximately 1h before the time of the breakfast).

The samples will be collected by each participant centre and shipped to the IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia (Prof. Diego Centonze) for the analyses.

Although Pilates did not show any significant advantage over standardized physical therapy in the current literature, it is a good method to promote physical activity, sensorimotor integration and cognitive stimulation. Thus, it could be a treatment option to improve fatigue, balance and walking abilities in PwMS; consequently, Pilates could be suggested by the clinician as a physical activity to be integrated in the daily life. This possibility could be made more feasible using new tools such as those offered by low cost devices. The main MS-FIT project purposes are to provide and to test a tool based on serious game concept of Pilates-inspired exercises for daily use at home, by mixing the entertainment aspects typical of the videogames and the possibility to perform physical activity. The MS-FIT tool does not pursue therapeutic aims as rehabilitation does, but it could have a positive impact on prevention and health in MS.

MS-FIT, through a multicentre approach, would provide: * Feasibility study * RCT study All the 14 participating centres will select a dedicated therapist who will be responsible for patient training in using the MS-FIT tool. All the subjects recruited following the inclusion/exclusion criteria will sign an informed consent and all the procedures (feasibility and RCT) will be in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and approved by Local Ethical Committee. No trial-specific procedures will be conducted before informed consent has been obtained, and participants will be reminded that they may withdraw from the trial at any time without it affecting the quality of their care in the future. Participants with relapses during the period of their involvement in the project will be considered as drop out and will be considered in the analysis for the entire period of study participation. Feasibility study Primary objective: • the refinement of the tool for the final customized version to be used in a RCT MS study. The primary objective will be reached by fixing eventual bugs relieved during the feasibility study and taking into account results from the assessment in terms of technology acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety and the physical effects of the intervention. Secondary Objectives: * the estimation of human resources necessary for the RCT. * the estimation of the effect of the intervention and its variance necessary to calculate the appropriate sample size for the RCT. Due to the nature of the feasibility study and based on previous literature showing that a sample size of 25-40 subjects per arm is adequate for a feasibility trial, the investigators will recruit 28 PwMS per arm. All the 14 participating centres will recruit a total of 56 recruited patients following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the range of EDSS inclusion criteria 28 subjects will be recruited with lower disability (EDSS 2-3) and 28 with higher disability (EDSS of 3.5 or 4). For both levels the subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITFeas (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLFeas (""unspecific physical activities""). Randomization will be provided by an independent randomization service at FISM accessed via a web-based system, using computer-based block randomization (1 factor: EDSS score 2-3 and 3.5-4). Patient will be allocated to MSFITFeas and CTRLFeas in a 1:1 ratio. Confirmation emails will be sent to Centres PI. The MSFITFeas group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 6 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 6 weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 6 weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home. The protocol for the Feasibility study will consist on (Figure 2): * T0 evaluation (PRE) * 6 weeks of intervention * MSFITFeas: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home * CTRLFeas: unspecific physical activities * T1 evaluation (POST) The evaluation for the Feasibility study are described in the section Outcome Measures. Deliverables Deliverables of the Feasibility study will be the final customized tool, a set of indications for the management of the RCT, the sample size estimation for the RCT. Focus group A nested qualitative study on 14 participants will explore patients' experiences of MS-FIT via Focus Group Meeting (FGM). The objectives are to provide insight into the quantitative results, explore strengths and limitations of the intervention with MS-FIT, so as to guide the RCT. The report of each FGM analysis will be submitted to FGM participants for review (respondent validation). Deliverables Deliverables of the nested qualitative study will be the delivery of the report of the FGM analysis. RCT study Primary Objective: • evaluation of the change in TUG. Secondary Objectives: * evaluation of the physical effects also in terms of self-reported outcome, upper limb performances, resistance in walking and physical activity, cognitive and psychosocial effects, quality of life and wellbeing. Differences in physical and cognitive performances due to the genetic features will be evaluated also considering subgroups identified through the polymorphism analysis. * evaluation of the acceptability and satisfaction-to-use, adherence to the intervention, intervention safety through the measurements of endpoint already listed for the Feasibility study. The RCT sample size will be definitively calculated based on the results from the feasibility study. However, by considering the literature about Pilates in MS, the investigators can preliminary estimate the needed sample size. In particular, the investigators refer to the TUG post-intervention improvement found by Karlon et al. in a group of PwMS performing Pilates. For our aim, the investigators can consider this result even if no differences between Pilates group and control group (Physiotherapy) were found. Pilates group improved the performance in TUG of about 1.8s, that could be considered as clinically relevant for PwMS. By considering a variability of about 3.4s, a power of 80%, a level of significance (two sided) of 5% and a potential loss of 15% of patients at follow-up, the estimation of the necessary sample size consists of approximately 63 subjects for the experimental group (a total of 126). All the 14 participating centres will be involved in the patients' enrolment. The subjects will be randomized into two groups: MSFITRCT (MS-FIT at-home + ""unspecific physical activities"") and CTRLRCT (""unspecific physical activities""). The randomization will be carried out using a web based procedure and will be centrally managed. A stratified minimization/adaptive algorithm will be used in order to balance the baseline EDSS (2-3 vs 3.5-4) factors across the two groups. The MSFITRCT group will self-manage MS-FIT at-home for 12 weeks, performing at least 3 sessions/week for a total of 30 minutes of exercises (also distributed during the day with a minimum slot of 10 minutes) for each session. During this period Xbox One and Microsoft Kinect 2.0 will be delivered to the participants for the aims of the study. Before starting the at-home intervention each subject will be trained to the use of the platform by a therapist. The follow-up (FU) evaluation will be after 6 weeks since the end of the intervention. No rehabilitative interventions except sphincter and speech rehabilitation and psychological support, are admitted for the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project. The execution of unspecific physical activities, if not already practiced, will be suggested to the participants. For the 18 (12 + 6) weeks of participation to the project CTRLFeas will be similar to MSFITFeas group except for the execution of MS-FIT at-home. At the end of the 18 weeks, the participants of the CTRLRCT group will be offered the MS-FIT intervention. The requirement that the enrolled patients will have not to perform any supervised physical activity or rehabilitative intervention is in line with recent studies showing that most of PwMS with mild disability (78.34% EDSS \<4) were not treated with rehabilitation. The subjects involved in the feasibility study will be excluded from the RCT study in order to avoid bias effects. The protocol design for the RCT study will consist on (Figure 3): * T0 evaluation (PRE) * 12 weeks of intervention * MSFITRCT: unspecific physical activities + MS-FIT at-home * CTRLRCT: unspecific physical activities * T1 evaluation (POST) * T2 evaluation (FU) - after 6 weeks from T1 The evaluation for the RCT study are described in the section Outcome Measures. Moreover, blood samples will be collected at T0 to investigate if genetic polymorphisms of candidate regulators of neuronal plasticity could be correlated to the response to the proposed protocol. According to previous report MS subjects of the two RCT groups could be subdivided in subgroups with respect to the polymorphism features. For example, for the CNR1 gene the subdivision could be based on the number of AAT repetitions (short AAT: homozygous or heterozygous for allele with ≤11 repeats of AAT triplets; long AAT: homozygous for allele with ≥12 repeats of AAT triplets). Differences among subgroups in terms of physical and cognitive performances will be evaluated. In particular, all patients will be genotyped for a total of 55 genetic polymorphisms of 23 potential regulators, like: Homer1; AKT1; RAPTOR; D2R; GAPD; CHAT; p53; BRCA2; LIG4; XRCC5; CYP3A4; NBS1; MDM2; CNR1, ATTn; CNR2; GRIN1; GRIN2B; TRPV1; FAAH, COMPT; (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) BDNF. Blood sample will be assessed from participants early in the morning after awakening (8h). To synchronize the sample for lifestyle variables, subjects were requested to avoid excessive physical activity the last three days before the blood sampling, sleep for 7-8h the night before study, avoid starving, and eat a usual breakfast in the morning (approximately 1h before the time of the breakfast). The samples will be collected by each participant centre and shipped to the IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Isernia (Prof. Diego Centonze) for the analyses. Deliverables Deliverables will be the report of the results of the trial and the final guidelines to make available and easy-to-use the MS-FIT tool Criteria for Premature Withdrawal Criteria for the premature withdrawal are: 1. Patients withdrawal of the consent anytime; 2. Any medical conditions that the investigator determines jeopardize the patient's safety if she/he continues the study and/or study results; 3.

MindMics has a working prototype of the ear buds which will perform all the conventional tasks of earbuds (listen to music, etc.), but, in addition, will measure heart rate, stress, blood pressure. The earbuds capture the sounds made by the various cardiac structures pulsing and moving blood. The sound is caused by the acceleration and deceleration of blood and the turbulence developed during rapid blood flow.","Introduction:

This study will evaluate the efficacy of the MindMics earbud recording apparatus to record data from patients with known atrial fibrillation as well as those in sinus rhythm. Patients in the clinic and patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled to undergo elective direct-current cardioversion will be the chosen subjects. This process will select a variety of patients to allow evaluation of the Mindmics apparatus's ability to collect data from patients with normal as well as abnormal cardiac rhythms.

Hypotheses

The MindMics earbud device is capable of recording normal cardiac rhythms in patients noninvasively using earbud device in a noninvasive manner. The same apparatus may be capable of discerning atrial fibrillation compared with normal sinus rhythm. This will be evaluated by collecting information from patients with atrial fibrillation in the office as well as those scheduled to undergo an elective direct-current cardioversion procedure. A timed recording of the clinical rhythm while wearing the apparatus will allow simultaneous recording of data from an ECG recording (documenting the patient's clinical arrhythmia) at the same time the MindMics earbud records its data obtained during the ECG recording of the patient's rhythm. For those patient scheduled for direct current cardioversion, the patient will undergo the direct-current cardioversion and a second recording will be obtained during sinus rhythm afterwards allowing an appropriate comparison of the differences in the recording sets.

The objective is to demonstrate differences between recordings made in atrial fibrillation and those in sinus rhythm that can be used to develop an algorithm allow discernment between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm.

OVERALL DESIGN

This study is designed to collect sequential patient's in a nonrandomized unblinded procedure designed to collect information using the apparatus to document its capability of recording cardiac rhythm data, then using this recorded data to determine whether the patient has an abnormal cardiac rhythm. Initial efforts will be directed to develop an algorithm to detect atrial fibrillation.

Patients will be recruited from inpatients at Palmetto Tuomey Medical center or in the outpatient office during routine office visits for patients with clinical arrhythmias for elective recording for group 1. Group 2 patients will be recruited prior to direct-current cardioversion. Both groups will be explained the study, what is their participation, potential risk and expectations for their participation in the study.

Once selected each patient will be required to sign a study protocol consent form before actual entry into the study. Once the consent is completed, the patients will be connected to the Mindmics apparatus as well as an electrocardiographic recording system. The study participant will lie quietly collecting simultaneous electrocardiographic data and data from the Mindmics earbuds. Group 1 patients will be identified as outpatients during their routine office visits will have 15 minutes of recording in a patient examination room during the office visit. Group 2 patients undergoing Direct-Current Cardioversion will have 15 minutes of recording prior to the cardioversion procedure and 15 minutes of recording after completion of the cardioversion procedure.

NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS

Approximately 25 patients will be recruited for group 1 from inpatient or outpatient office visits. These patients will have persistent atrial fibrillation during the office visit. If necessary would consider increasing the total number of patients to 50 in this group Approximately 25 patients will be recruited for group 2 prior to direct-current cardioversion allowing collection of data from before and after cardioversion to document differences in recordings during sinus rhythm after having successful cardioversion from atrial fibrillation. While certainly some patients will revert back to atrial fibrillation and not have periods of sinus rhythm is anticipated the vast majority of patients will have successful cardioversions long enough to record at least the 15 minutes post cardioversion in sinus rhythm. If necessary would consider increasing the total number of patients to 50 in this group

DURATION The total duration of involvement for each study participant is for the duration of the recording interval. Group 1 participants will have a 15-minute recording interval while those in group to will have 2 sessions of 15 minutes each separated by the direct current cardioversion. No further participation will be required.

All data collected during the study will be kept by Mindmics. All data collected in the study will be de-identified

OUTCOME MEASURES and STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Each recording will be evaluated by Mindmics to evaluate the ability of the recording apparatus to provide data that would lead to clear discernment of the patient's cardiac rhythm as well as rate related phenomena. At this juncture, it is anticipated the collected data will be used to develop and test algorithms yet to be developed and to make clinical determinations of the cardiac rhythms.

Initial data will be evaluated to determine if the Mindmics earbuds are capable of discriminating atrial fibrillation from normal sinus rhythm. For that reason, it is not possible to suggest a statistical method until it is determined the device data can be used to evaluate differences in cardiac rhythm.

SAFETY

There is no potential harm or injury associated with the research. The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. There are no potential risks with respect to psychological, sociological, economic, or legal. The overall risk of the device in minimum.

James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center,FED,NCT03037879,Treating Cognitive Deficits in Spinal Cord Injury,Treating Cognitive Deficits in Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Multiple studies in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population have documented deficits in learning and memory (LM) and processing speed (PS) that adversely impact daily life and the ability to benefit from rehabilitation. The investigators have previously attributed the cognitive deficits demonstrated in the SCI population to low blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) and are currently conducting a study to determine the effect of a 30-day elevation in BP (using midodrine hydrochloride - an alpha agonist) on CBF and cognitive performance compared to placebo in hypotensive individuals with SCI. In addition, the investigators believe that cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) may improve cognition independent of changes in BP and CBF in individuals with SCI. The current randomized clinical trial (RCT) will examine the efficacy of 2 treatment protocols shown to be effective in improving cognitive performance in other neurologically impaired populations for use in persons with SCI demonstrating (1) LM impairment and/or (2) PS impairment on objective measures of cognitive functioning during a complete Neuropsychological assessment. Two methods of outcome assessment will be used to examine treatment impact: (1) a traditional Neuropsychological assessment (NP) and (2) an assessment of global functioning (AGF) composed of broader outcome measures that examine the impact of the treatment on everyday life activities. In this way, the investigators will be able to objectively evaluate the presence or absence of changes in memory performance through a NP assessment, while also evaluating the impact of this treatment protocol on everyday life through the AGF. While most studies evaluating the efficacy of cognitive retraining usually employ a pre- and post-training evaluation, such evaluations have been criticized for their lack of ecological validity (i.e., real world generalizability). The present design allows the assessment of the efficacy of these treatment techniques within an SCI population using traditional measures, as well as the assessment of the impact that treatment has on everyday life. The investigators will additionally evaluate the long-term efficacy by including a 6-month post-treatment follow-up. Few studies examine long-term effects, but given the time, labor and expense involved, it is critical to demonstrate long-term efficacy.","104 individuals with SCI will be recruited for eligibility to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=26 per group) story memory technique (mSMT), mSMT control, speed of processing training (SPT) and SPT control.

The study involves 14 visits spread over 8 months. A screening visit, lasting approximately 1 hour. 3 testing sessions lasting 3-4 hours each (Baseline, Immediate and Long-term follow-ups), and 10 intervention sessions that will last approximately 45 minutes each.

Screening: Prior to enrollment in the study protocol, all potential subjects will undergo cognitive screening to determine eligibility for participation.

Baseline: After passing screening, subjects will be scheduled for the baseline evaluation comprised of a cardiovascular/cerebrovascular assessment and cognitive evaluation.

Intervention: Subjects will undergo 10 sessions of training in one of the 4 randomized groups.

Immediate Follow-up Assessment: Subjects will undergo a repeat of the baseline assessments upon completion of the intervention protocol to document changes in PS, LM, BP and CBF following treatment.

Long-Term Follow-up: Subjects will be asked to return to the laboratory 6 months following the intervention for evaluation of the maintenance of the treatment effect over time. Baseline and Immediate follow-up measures of PS, LM, BP and CBF will be documented.","Inclusion Criteria:

The investigators have previously attributed the cognitive deficits demonstrated in the SCI population to low blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) and are currently conducting a study to determine the effect of a 30-day elevation in BP (using midodrine hydrochloride - an alpha agonist) on CBF and cognitive performance compared to placebo in hypotensive individuals with SCI. In addition, the investigators believe that cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) may improve cognition independent of changes in BP and CBF in individuals with SCI. The current randomized clinical trial (RCT) will examine the efficacy of 2 treatment protocols shown to be effective in improving cognitive performance in other neurologically impaired populations for use in persons with SCI demonstrating (1) LM impairment and/or (2) PS impairment on objective measures of cognitive functioning during a complete Neuropsychological assessment. Two methods of outcome assessment will be used to examine treatment impact: (1) a traditional Neuropsychological assessment (NP) and (2) an assessment of global functioning (AGF) composed of broader outcome measures that examine the impact of the treatment on everyday life activities. In this way, the investigators will be able to objectively evaluate the presence or absence of changes in memory performance through a NP assessment, while also evaluating the impact of this treatment protocol on everyday life through the AGF. While most studies evaluating the efficacy of cognitive retraining usually employ a pre- and post-training evaluation, such evaluations have been criticized for their lack of ecological validity (i.e., real world generalizability). The present design allows the assessment of the efficacy of these treatment techniques within an SCI population using traditional measures, as well as the assessment of the impact that treatment has on everyday life. The investigators will additionally evaluate the long-term efficacy by including a 6-month post-treatment follow-up. Few studies examine long-term effects, but given the time, labor and expense involved, it is critical to demonstrate long-term efficacy. 104 individuals with SCI will be recruited for eligibility to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=26 per group) story memory technique (mSMT), mSMT control, speed of processing training (SPT) and SPT control. The study involves 14 visits spread over 8 months. A screening visit, lasting approximately 1 hour. 3 testing sessions lasting 3-4 hours each (Baseline, Immediate and Long-term follow-ups), and 10 intervention sessions that will last approximately 45 minutes each. Screening: Prior to enrollment in the study protocol, all potential subjects will undergo cognitive screening to determine eligibility for participation. Baseline: After passing screening, subjects will be scheduled for the baseline evaluation comprised of a cardiovascular/cerebrovascular assessment and cognitive evaluation. Intervention: Subjects will undergo 10 sessions of training in one of the 4 randomized groups. Immediate Follow-up Assessment: Subjects will undergo a repeat of the baseline assessments upon completion of the intervention protocol to document changes in PS, LM, BP and CBF following treatment. Long-Term Follow-up: Subjects will be asked to return to the laboratory 6 months following the intervention for evaluation of the maintenance of the treatment effect over time. Baseline and Immediate follow-up measures of PS, LM, BP and CBF will be documented.

UMC Utrecht,OTHER,NCT00821379,CoPPer Study - Complications of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Pregnancy: Evaluating Risk,Complications of PCOS Pregnancy: Evaluating Risk,The CoPPer study is a follow-up study of women diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Women will be included pre-conceptional and followed-up until after delivery. The investigators will design a multivariate prediction model of pregnancy outcome in women with PCOS with the intention to define intervention strategies for the future.,"Background of the study:

PCOS is a heterogeneous condition in which metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance are common. Pregnancies in women with PCOS are reported to have an increased chance of being complicated by gestational diabetes, pregnancy induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Subsequently their offspring are reported to have a lower birth weight and higher risk of admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. However, the cause of increased complication rate is not yet identified.

There is evidence that intra-uterine conditions as well as pre- and periconception factors influence not only neonatal outcome, but also long-term health of the child. Therefore early detection and treatment of pregnancy complications is important for both mother and child.

In order to identify high risk PCOS pregnancies, the specific effects of PCOS on pregnancy in comparison to the background effects need further investigation.

Preconceptional risk assessment of PCOS women is needed to improve antenatal health care and pregnancy outcome of PCOS pregnancies in the future.

Objective of the study:

To design a multivariate prediction model of pregnancy outcome in women with PCOS with the intention to define intervention strategies for the future.

Study design:

Prospective multi-centre follow-up cohort study.

* The prefabricated commercially available zirconia crowns (NuSmile®) (NZC).
* The locally manufactured zirconia crowns created via Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system (CCZC).
* The locally manufactured hybrid ceramic crowns created via Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system (CCHC).","Eighty lower second primary molars will be divided into 4 groups:

* Group 1(n=20): receive 3M™ ESPE™ Stainless Steel crowns for Primary Molars.
* Group 2 (n=20): receive the prefabricated commercially available zirconia crowns (NuSmile®) (NZC).
* Group 3 (n=20): receive the locally manufactured zirconia crowns created via (CAD/CAM) system (CCZC).
* Group 4 (n=20): receive the locally manufactured hybrid ceramic crowns created via (CAD/CAM) system (CCHC).

Clinical and radiographic examination of the primary molar will be conducted to ensure compliance with the study criteria. Oral health instructions will be given to the child and parents then the application of local anesthesia.

1. Stainless steel crowns:

   Reduction of occlusal surface by about 1.5 mm using a flame shaped diamond bur to produce a uniform occlusal reduction. Proximal reduction using a long and tapered diamond bur to allow the probe to pass through the contact area. An appropriate size will be selected according to mesiodistal width of the prepared tooth and a trial fit will be carried out before cementation. The crown should remain no more than 1 mm subgingivally.(21)
2. Zirconia and hybrid ceramic crowns:

   The appropriate size of the posterior crown will be selected for the tooth chosen for treatment. The occlusal surface will be reduced by 1-2 mm by using a flame bur after evaluation of the occlusal relationships. The interproximal areas will be opened followed by reduction of the crown dimensions by 0.5-1.25 mm using a tapered diamond bur making the contour of the prepared tooth consistent with the natural contour. The prepared tooth walls will be finished with a 1-2 mm subgingival feather-edge preparation using a thinner pointed tapered diamond bur.

   The selected crown will be tested for appropriate fit before the final cementation. Finally, the prepared tooth will be cleaned from saliva, blood, and the remnants of preparation and ready for cementation.(15) The selected crown will be cleaned and then filled with resin modified glass ionomer cement. The crown will be applied with no resistance to the fully seated position on the tooth (Passive Fit) since forcing the crown to place can produce micro-fractures in the zirconia structure. Excess cement will be removed using a dental probe and dental floss.

   Clinical evaluation:

   o Evaluation criteria concerning the clinical performance are

1) The Gingival Index (GI)(22) will be measured by the William Gingival Probe with a blunt-ended instrument gently placed within the gingival gutter around each tooth to be crowned/previously crowned, and the values will be as follows: 0 = normal gingiva

1. = mild inflammation: a slight change in color, slight edema, no bleeding on probing
2. = moderate inflammation: redness, edema, and glazing, or bleeding on probing
3. =severe inflammation: marked redness and edema, a tendency toward spontaneous bleeding, ulceration.

2) Plaque Index (PI)(22) will be measured by passing the gingival probe around each tooth to be crowned/previously crowned, and the values will be as follows: 0 = no plaque

1= film at the gingival margin and adjacent tooth 2 = moderate accumulation of plaque 3 = abundance of plaque.

Crown retention (23) will be measured as follows:

0 = present.

1 = absent.

Crown integrity(24) will be measured as follows:

0 = intact.

1. = crack present.
2. = fracture present.
3. = crown lost.

Marginal adaptation will be measured clinically and radiographically:

1) All crowns will be evaluated clinically at baseline, 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th months and scored as follows:(25) 0 = Margin not discernible, probe does not catch.

1. = Probe catches on margin but no gap on probing.
2. = Probe catches on margin and a gap on probing.
3. = Crown fractured or missing. 2) All crowns will be evaluated radiographically at baseline, 6th, and 12th months to check the marginal adaptation.

Color stability(26) will be measured as follows:

0 = Unchanged.

1 = Minor deviation from original. Wear of the antagonistic natural enamel. To evaluate the wear of the antagonistic natural enamel of primary molar, a rubber base impressions will be made immediately (baseline) and at 1 year after cementation. The resulting casts will be scanned (using a 3D scanner), and 3D softare will be used to calculate the maximum amount of linear wear. (27)

o Evaluation criteria regarding the crown convenience: Time elapsed since the start of tooth preparation till the crown cementation. Anxiety using the Facial Image Scale (FIS).(28) The Facial image scale comprises a row of five faces ranging from very happy to very unhappy. The children were asked to point at which face they felt most like at that moment. The scale is scored by giving a value of one to the most positive affect face and five to the most negative affect face. Facial Image Scale has a fixed number of faces (not a continuous line) for the children to choose from, thus making it easier to score in a clinical situation, and easier for very young children to understand.","Inclusion Criteria:

Color stability(26) will be measured as follows: 0 = Unchanged. 1 = Minor deviation from original. Wear of the antagonistic natural enamel. To evaluate the wear of the antagonistic natural enamel of primary molar, a rubber base impressions will be made immediately (baseline) and at 1 year after cementation. The resulting casts will be scanned (using a 3D scanner), and 3D softare will be used to calculate the maximum amount of linear wear.

Anxiety using the Facial Image Scale (FIS).(28) The Facial image scale comprises a row of five faces ranging from very happy to very unhappy. The children were asked to point at which face they felt most like at that moment. The scale is scored by giving a value of one to the most positive affect face and five to the most negative affect face. Facial Image Scale has a fixed number of faces (not a continuous line) for the children to choose from, thus making it easier to score in a clinical situation, and easier for very young children to understand.

Ohio State University,OTHER,NCT03503279,Endotracheal Tube Placement Using McGrath MAC® Video Laryngoscope Versus Macintosh Laryngoscope,"A Prospective, Randomized, Single Center Study to Compare Endotracheal Tube Placement Using McGrath MAC® Video Laryngoscope Versus Macintosh Laryngoscope in Bariatric Surgery Patients","This study aims...

* To assess the difference in intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score following ETT placement using McGrath MAC® video laryngoscope versus conventional intubation with Macintosh laryngoscope for bariatric surgery patients
* To assess the difference in hemodynamic stimulation (airway manipulation) events in both groups
* To assess the overall difference of the duration (seconds) of ETT placement between both groups
* To assess the difference of the duration (seconds) of ETT placement during every attempt (maximum of three attempts) between both groups.
* To assess the difference of STOP BANG score between both groups
* To assess the number of intubation attempts between both groups","The failure to place properly an endotracheal tube (ETT) and to secure the airway is still significantly impacting morbidity and mortality in surgical and critical care settings. In addition, no assertive predictor factor will foresee the presence of difficult airway, most of them being acknowledged after anesthesia induction. The incidence of difficult intubation reported in different studies varies from 0.1% to 13%.

The gold standard device to place an ETT that has been used since 1943 is the Macintosh laryngoscope (ML). However, in contemplation of addressing these challenging factors related to endotracheal intubation failure, modern airway devices technology has been developed in order to improve orotracheal visualization, reduce orotracehal manipulation and ensure airway patency.

As part of these novel devices, several video laryngoscopies (VL) have s been developed to secure the airway and improve the management of difficult intubation. Difficult Airway Society (DAS) guidelines recognizes the usefulness of VL in difficult intubation by providing an improved view of the airway to clinicians and directly observe/report the effects of laryngeal manipulation.

Among several VL introduced recently, a McGrath MAC® VL was announced in 2012. McGrath MAC® is a self-contained VL with a single-use blade; its structure is similar to the ML, but without the channel that guides the tube and a mounted LCD screen on the handle that is connected to a miniature camera with a light source at the tip of the blade, allowing the clinicians to directly observe surrounding anatomical airway structures during a tracheal intubation. These features have shown a better glottis visualization and to be supportive during tracheal intubation of difficult airways.

The McGrath MAC® VL and ML are standard of care devices used according to anesthesia care providers' criteria at our institution.

A single-center, prospective, randomized, double arm study, will be conducted in order to test the following hypothesis:

Reduced manipulation of the airway using McGrath MAC® VL will lead to less hemodynamic stimulation events following intubation when compared to ML.

The non-disposable portion of the McGrath MAC® VL (upper mounted reusable video camera and the optic guide) will be cleaned between usages in accordance to manufacture catalogue and institutional policy (using disinfectants such as CIDEXTM OPA, a 0.08% paracetic acid solution or disinfecting wipes).","2.2.

Chongqing General Hospital,OTHER,NCT06793579,Lateral Approach for Mediastinal Lymph Node Dissection in Thyroid Cancer,Thyroid Cancer Superior Mediastinal Lymph Node Dissection Via Lateral Cervical Approach: Exploration and Practice of a Novel Surgical Pathway,"Despite the numerous surgical approaches available for superior mediastinal lymph node dissection in thyroid cancer, many of these methods still have significant limitations. In this study, we report for the first time a novel surgical technique for superior mediastinal lymph node dissection: a thyroid cancer surgery based on a lateral cervical approach. This technique offers a new surgical option for the dissection of superior mediastinal lymph nodes in thyroid cancer.","The incidence of thyroid cancer has been steadily rising over the past several decades, making it a significant focus of clinical and scientific research. Superior mediastinal lymph node metastasis, as a regional manifestation of thyroid cancer metastasis, is a clinically relevant yet underexplored phenomenon. According to previous studies, the incidence of superior mediastinal lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is approximately 6% to 12%, while in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), this rate is notably higher, reaching up to 18%. Although rarer, follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) can also involve superior mediastinal lymph node metastasis. Despite the clinical significance of this type of metastasis, international research on its surgical management remains limited, and there is currently no standardized treatment protocol for superior mediastinal lymph node dissection in thyroid cancer patients.

At present, there are four commonly utilized surgical approaches for superior mediastinal lymph node dissection in thyroid cancer: open surgery via a cervical incision, endoscopic surgery through a cervical approach, thoracoscopic surgery, and open thoracotomy. Among these, the open surgery performed through a cervical incision is often regarded as an extension of central compartment lymph node dissection. Following the dissection of the central lymph nodes, the procedure continues downward along the trachea to remove lymph nodes situated above the right brachiocephalic artery and the left brachiocephalic vein. This approach is favored for its relatively simple learning curve, lower surgical trauma, and shorter operative time, making it a preferred method when anatomical and technical conditions allow.

However, anatomical limitations pose significant challenges to this technique. The right brachiocephalic vein lies beneath the right brachiocephalic artery, while the aortic arch are located below the left brachiocephalic vein. Even with the assistance of surgical retractors, these anatomical features often obstruct the lower portions of the lymph nodes in the superior mediastinal regions 2R and 2L, limiting surgical visibility and access. This constraint can result in incomplete lymph node dissection and, in many cases, necessitates a switch to alternative approaches such as endoscopic surgery or open thoracotomy during the procedure. Furthermore, in hospitals with limited technical expertise or surgical resources, these challenges may lead to the inability to perform superior mediastinal lymph node dissection altogether.

To address these limitations, this study seeks to propose and evaluate a novel surgical approach aimed at expanding the dissection range achievable through a cervical incision. This new technique aims to improve surgical accessibility, reduce procedural complexity, and provide a more feasible and effective option for superior mediastinal lymph node dissection in thyroid cancer. By enhancing the scope and precision of the procedure, this study aspires to contribute to the development of more standardized and widely applicable surgical strategies for the management of thyroid cancer metastasis.","Inclusion Criteria:

Hospitalized patients are at increased risk for the development of blood clots in the legs, known as deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Surgical patients are in a higher risk category than the general hospital population due to a number of factors including undergoing surgery and increased risk of immobility. The highest risk patients are in the surgical intensive care unit, where their surgical risks for blood clots are combined with issues such as sepsis, acquired blood clotting disorders, and increasing age, each of which are factors that contribute to the risk of blood clot development. 1. Patients who develop these blood clots (DVTs) are at risk for chronic leg swelling, pain, and in some cases, chronic ulcer development on the leg. In the worst case scenario, these blood clots can break away and migrate to the lungs where they cause a pulmonary embolism (PE), a clot in the lungs that can cause significant breathing difficulty requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, and in some cases, death.

According to recent research, DVTs account for over 200,000 patient deaths each year nationwide. 2. A large amount of data has supported the use of medication called heparin or enoxaparin in low doses to prevent these blood clots from forming while in the hospital. Both of these medications are considered standard of care for use patients considered moderate and high risk for the development of DVT. 3. While both of these medications have been shown to significantly reduce the occurrence of DVT in appropriate doses, 4. there has never been a direct comparison of the two medications in the highest-risk population of the surgical intensive care unit. Our own preliminary data suggests patients may have a lower incidence of DVTs with the use of enoxaparin versus heparin.

In order to evaluate the delta between pre-operative and post-operative hemoglobin (blood loss parameters) in patients with isolated PW acetabular fractures that were treated with topical TXA or a placebo, investigators will prospectively enroll all eligible patients with the diagnosis of a closed, isolated, PW acetabular fracture that requires surgical fixation. Isolated PW fractures have been chosen to reduce confounding variables, particularly those associated with more complex fracture patterns including longer surgery duration and blood loss.

Each subject will have a pre-operative Hb and Hct drawn on the morning of surgery to establish a baseline level. Prior to surgery, subjects will be computer-randomized by pharmacy to one of two groups: a topical TXA group and a control group. The topical TXA group will be treated with 2 gm/100 ml of normal saline, while the control group will be treated with a placebo (normal saline) in a similar fashion to the TXA experimental group.

The surgeon and the operative team will be blinded as to whether the patient receives TXA or placebo.

Intraoperative transfusion requirements and estimated blood loss (EBL) will be recorded for every patient.

Hemoglobin and hematocrit values will be obtained on postoperative day one and two with routine morning blood draws (typically 5 am-9 am).

The Action Observation (AO) evokes an internal, real-time motor simulation of the movements that the observer is perceiving visually. Both mental processes trigger the activation of the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie the planning and execution of voluntary movements in a manner that resembles how the action is performed in a real manner.

Both observation and imagination share a great number of common mental processes based primarily on sensory perception, and the information stored by memory systems. The activation of the motor command during a mental practice does not induce an active movement probably due to an inhibitory mechanism in the primary motor cortex on the descending corticospinal tract pathways. However, this inhibition is not complete, for it is well known that the training of mental practice involves a component of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).

It has been shown that both MI and AO lead to changes in the ANS that cause excitatory sympathetic responses, although the neurophysiological bases remain uncertain and are still based on hypotheses. The functional relations between both neurocognitive processes and the sympathetic-excitatory nervous system (SNS) could be based on a preparation phase in which, the activation of the SNS, happens to a near effort and, therefore, to a close energy expenditure in physiological processes (i.e., cardiorespiratory adaptationse) which will take place in order to face said metabolic changes produced by the voluntary movement itself. In addition, several hypotheses have been described regarding the notion that the SNS not only has the quantitative objective of providing energy to the muscle effectors, but that it also qualitatively and specifically designs and adapts the parameters on demand in an attempt to save the energy provided for each precise motor execution.

Taking into account that both MI and AO cause sympathetic-excitatory changes that induce an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, electrodermal activity , our hypothesis is that the combination of MI and AO induces an autonomic sympathetic-excitatory shift greater than MI does in isolation. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to compare the results obtained from intervention groups on the subject of the activation of the SNS in a program that combined MI with AO, in contrast to an isolated MI program on the one hand in asymptomatic subjects and in the other hand in patients with chronic low back pain.. The secondary objective of the present study was to explore whether there is any relationship between the sympathetic-excitatory response and the ability to generate motor imagery, the mental chronometry, and the level of physical activity.","Inclusion Criteria asymptomatic subjects:

Johns Hopkins University,OTHER,NCT03212079,Physical Activities by Technology Help (PATH),Novel Individualized Intervention for Behavioral Change Among High-Risk Group Cancer Survivors : Physical Activities by Technology Help (PATH),PATH is a research study for cancer survivors to help participants to become more active. Studies suggested an association between inactivity and cancer. The investigators created new novel ways and technologies that may help participants to become more active. The three methods the investigators are studying are: 1) participant become active on her/his own; educational material will be provided; 2) working with a programmed health coach over the phone via text messages; and 3) using digital voice assist to help participant become more active. The digital voice assist will be delivered via Amazon Alexa on Echo speaker (it is the famous intelligent voice that you see in superball commercial by Alec Baldwin). This study is funded by the State of Maryland.,"If the participant agree to be in this study, the investigators will ask the participant to do the following things:

The participant will be asked questions about his/her physical activity (walking, running or other exercise) to determine if he/she are eligible to participate. If the participant is eligible and interested in participating, the investigators will ask hi/her to read and sign the consent form.

After that, the investigators will randomly assign the participant to a research group (this method would be similar to drawing numbers from a hat). The result will determine which group the participant will belong to. The study would have three different groups:

1. Group one will be self-motivated to be physically active (control group)
2. The second group will receive smart daily text messages only (text group);
3. The last group would have the Amazon Echo smart device installed in participants' homes and they will interact with a digital voice assist that will help them be active (Alexa group).

   * All study participants will receive a Fitbit device which you can keep after the study.
   * When the investigators start the study, the participant will be asked to start wearing wrist device immediately. For the next one week the investigators will monitor the participant daily number of steps to establish how active he/she is. The participant will not be required to change his/her daily routine in the first week.
   * After the end of the first week, the investigators will ask the participant to increase his/her daily steps to at least 10 thousand steps per day for the next four weeks. In total the participant will have one week of hi/her normal daily routine and four weeks of trying to do 10 thousand steps per day or more.
   * If the participant is in the control group, the investigators will ask you to try to do 10 thousand steps per day on his/her own.
   * If the participant are in the text group, he/she will get smart text messages with healthy tips to help track his/her activities and reach his/her daily goal.

Stanford University,OTHER,NCT01449279,Pilot Ipilimumab in Stage IV Melanoma Receiving Palliative Radiation Therapy,A Pilot Study of Ipilimumab in Subjects With Stage IV Melanoma Receiving Palliative Radiation Therapy,To determine the safety of local palliative radiation therapy used in combination with anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy.,"This is a single institution, open-label, pilot study of palliative radiation therapy (RT) combined with ipilimumab in patients with stage IV melanoma. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of combining ipilimumab with palliative RT in patients with Stage IV melanoma. Secondary objectives are a) to assess the induction of anti-melanoma immune responses using laboratory correlative studies of T cell responses to melanoma antigens, and b) to compare tumor response rates and duration of response at unirradiated sites with responses in patients with Stage IV disease treated with ipilimumab alone on expanded access study CA184045. In this study, ipilimumab will be administered as recently approved by the FDA (3 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments). Palliative RT will start within 2 days of the first ipilimumab dose. Patients will be seen at least every 12 weeks for follow-up following completion of ipilimumab therapy until progression of disease by imaging criteria or increased symptomatology that requires another therapy. A total of 20 patients with previously treated unresectable metastatic melanoma requiring palliative radiation therapy will be treated on this pilot study over approximately 18 months. All subjects who receive study drug will be monitored for safety. Relevant tumor imaging studies will be obtained at baseline, 2-4 weeks following the 4th/last dose of ipilimumab, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. This study will provide the safety data (and possibly early efficacy signals) needed to proceed with a randomized Phase II study for proof of principle. If compelling data is obtained supporting this IT + RT vaccine strategy, this approach will be extended to other solid tumor types.","Inclusion Criteria:

Frisius Medisch Centrum,OTHER,NCT03930979,The Effect of Hyperoxia on Cardiac Output,The Effect of Hyperoxia on Cardiac Output in Patients Undergoing Procedural Sedation in the Emergency Department.,"Rational: Preoxygenation is a standard procedure before (deep) sedation in the ED. However, there is literature suggesting that too much oxygen can be harmful. One potential detrimental effect is a decrease in cardiac output due to coronary vasoconstriction. So far, it is unknown if this effect is rate dependent and if it also occurs after only a short period of hyperoxia, as patients experience during procedural sedation pre-oxygenation.

Objective: To investigate if hyperoxia has a negative effect on Cardiac index (CI) in patients undergoing procedural sedation in the ED.","Methods: In patients needing sedation for a painful condition, non-invasive measurements of CI, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance are performed using the Clearsight non-invasive cardiac output monitoring system.. Measurements will be taken at baseline, after 1,2 and 5 minutes of 15L O2/min, and then after another 2 and 5 minutes of flush rate oxygen and during the subsequent sedation.","Inclusion Criteria:

Facharztzentrum Sonneberg-Coburg uBAG,OTHER,NCT05440279,Effects of Telemedical Support on Therapeutic Results of CPAP Patients,Effects of an Early Combination of Automated Electronic and Telemedical Support on the Therapeutic Results of CPAP and APAP Patients and as a Supplement to (Tele-) Medical Care,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a type of sleep-related breathing disorders that is characterized by a sleep-related constriction (obstruction) of the upper airways. The treatment with continuous application of positive airway pressure (CPAP) via respiratory mask forms the therapeutical standard of OSA. The autoCPAP (automatic positive airway pressure: APAP) therapy is an additional treatment option for patients with more unstable conditions (e.g. due to sleep position) which is characterized by a dynamic adaption of the applied airway pressure according to patients therapeutical needs. Device usage time and therapy adherence are crucial for treatment success.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a digital patient support (DPS) tool, complementary to standard care on continuous and automatic positive airway pressure (CPAP, APAP) adherence and daytime sleepiness after 12 weeks in patients diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

All patients with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 30 per hour are prospectively included and randomized to receive standard care (SC) or standard care with personalized DPS via prisma APP prototype version (SC+DPS). In both arms, initiation of therapy and standardized therapy control after 12 weeks is carried out identically. Patients in the SC+DPS arm received additionally automated feedback on their therapy and motivational messages, as well as therapy recommendations.","Clinical Picture From the epidemiological view obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD). OSA is characterized by a sleep-related constriction (obstruction) of the upper airways that in adulthood is often caused by a neuromuscular related impairment of the pharyngeal tone. OSA is linked to many negative health consequences and is associated with a large number of comorbidities.

General treatment As a rule SRBD are treated with appropriate therapy devices that transmit positive airway pressure (PAP) via respiratory masks. In the case of the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) therapeutical standard is formed by application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP therapy devices provide a stable positive airway pressure during sleep to prevent the upper airway obstructions. The determination of the essential airway pressure that keeps airways open takes place within the therapy setting night in the sleep laboratory under polysomnographic monitoring. Patients with more unstable pressure needs, e.g. based on position shifts during the night, also qualify for an autoCPAP (APAP) therapy. APAP therapy devices adapt the applied airway pressure dynamically within defined ranges according to patients' therapeutical needs. Therapy success is essentially defined by average device usage time and patients' long-term therapy adherence which in term is affected by a broad variety of factors. The identification of these factors therefore lead to the development of different treatment strategies to improve patients' therapy adherence.

Usual therapeutical process Patients with suspected OSA are surveyed according to their symptomatology and receive a sleep medical examination under polygraphical or polysomnographical observation. During the sleep medical examination numerous cardiorespiratory and somnological signals are recorded and evaluated.

As far as the evaluation of the recorded signals leads to the diagnosis of OSA and no indications for another type of PAP therapy are present, the adjustment to CPAP or APAP therapy under polysomnographical observation takes place immediately after diagnosis.

Following this, patients receive an appropriate adjusted CPAP- or APAP therapy device and get introduced in it´s handling to continue therapy by themselves in their home environment.

As part of the nightly home therapy, patients are expected to use the device according to the physicians advice. During the home therapy phase, the device is recording specific data to subsequently allow to draw conclusions about the therapeutic process and the therapy quality. In case of difficulties with therapy and dependent on their causes, patients are admonished to contact the sleep laboratory (regarding general problems with therapy) or the provider (regarding problems with the respiratory mask or device settings).

After a period of about 12 weeks, patients again appear in person in the sleep laboratory as part of the general therapy control. During the therapy control, the home usage data recorded by the therapy device are printed in reportform and the interventions which were implemented between first therapy setting and the therapy control are evaluated.

Finally, the medicating physician evaluates the therapy success within a conversation with the patients. In case of an inadequate outcome, therapy settings may have to be optimized.

Rationale of the study Literature shows that the first days of home therapy are crucial for long-term therapy adherence and that telemetrical support through automatic feedback can have a positive effect on therapy adherence.

However, there is a lack of experience how the effect on therapy outcomes caused by more individualized, automatic feedbacks combined with an appropriate supply of information and motivation over a longer period can be assessed.

This study is intended to investigate if therapy outcomes of CPAP and APAP patients can be further improved by an early intervention in the form of a combination of telemetric and electronic support.

Description of the applied medical device The applied medical device are the CE certified medical devices prismaSOFT/ prismaSMART (Type WM090TD) made by Löwenstein Medical Techology GmbH und Co. KG Hamburg. The applied accessories (especially breathing tubes, masks, humidifier, modems) are CE certified, too.

Devices of the WM090TD type are pressure-controlled, non-invasive, non-lifesupporting therapy devices or treating sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs) using a mask. The devices are used on persons weighing 30 kg or more. CPAP mode can be used on persons aged 3 years upwards. The device may only be used on a physician's instructions. (auto)CPAP mode provides positive airway pressure for treating obstructive sleep apnea in patients who breathe spontaneously.

Devices of the WM090TD type are used in clinical facilities and in the domestic environment. In the domestic environment, the devices also ac-company the owner on trips away.

The application of the device as part of this study takes place according to it´s intended use and within it´s indication range.

Procedure and interventions

If an OSA was diagnosed, patients will be asked for study participation and get informed about the rationale of the study. In case of patients informed consent they will be randomized to one of two groups (Standard Care = control group vs. Standard Care + Digital Patient Support Tool = intervention group).

At baseline, all patients receive an education session with a respiratory therapist about OSA and its consequences, proper use and maintenance of the CPAP device and mask, and therapy and study expectations. All patients are provided with a fixed or auto CPAP device (prismaSMART/ prismaSOFT, Löwenstein Medical Technology GmbH \& Co. KG), a heated humidifier (prismaAQUA, Löwenstein Medical Technology GmbH \& Co. KG) if needed, and a fitting interface. The initiation of therapy with anamnesis, diagnosis night, titration night, education, etc., as well as standardized therapy control after 12 weeks is carried out identically in standard care (SC) and in standard care with personalized digital support via prototype of prisma APP (SC+DPS) group and according to clinical routine.

At the beginning and with completion of the study every participant is surveyed about his daytime sleepiness applying the standardized questionnaire ""Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)"".

With completion of the study, each patient furthermore assesses his satisfaction with the CPAP therapy in general and with focus on therapy instructions and support. For this purpose, they rate 8 questions on a scale of 0-4, with a 4 being the best rating (0: strongly disagree, 1: barely disagree, 2: partly agree, 3: mostly agree, 4: strongly agree).

The intervention (SC+DPS) group receives electronic therapy support in addition to standard care. The electronic therapy support consists of:

1. Emails to patients with personalized, automated feedback on their therapy (derived from device data received via modem or data entered by the patient via electronic questionnaire),
2. electronic questionnaires (web-based) on possible problems during therapy and subjective therapy success,
3. possibility to set personal adherence goals every week,
4. links to explanations and videos on therapy and the handling of therapy equipment and accessories,
5. provision of data for the trial center in the event of contact by the patient, as well as for routine therapy monitoring.","Inclusion Criteria:

"Insel Gruppe AG, University Hospital Bern",OTHER,NCT02428179,Impact of Structured Communication in the OR on Surgical Site Infections: Prospective Observational Clinical Trial,StOP?-Trial: Impact of Structured Communication in the OR on Surgical Site Infections: Prospective Observational Clinical Trial,"Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most frequent complication in patients that undergo abdominal surgery. A previous prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing elective open abdominal procedures showed that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI whereas case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for incisional SSI. Therefore, the introduction of a clinical applicable intervention ""structured briefing using the StOP protocol"" has been developed and was tested in pilot experiments. This intervention aims at improving case-relevant communication during the procedure and to reduce excess case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation.

The hypothesis is: structured briefings during an operation reduce the incidence of SSI after surgery.","Background

A number of publications has shown a relatively high rate of complications that are related to the treatment and not to the disease. Such iatrogenic incidents are an important influence on patient morbidity and increase healthcare costs. Therefore, patient safety and minimizing the risk of iatrogenic harm has become a major concern in healthcare. Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most frequent complication in patients that undergo surgery, leading to considerable costs.

In a previous study, the investigators established an empirical relationship between communication during surgery and SSI was shown in a prospective observational study in 167 patients undergoing major elective open abdominal procedures. An analysis of 11383 communication events observed by a team of trained work psychologists showed a relationship between intraoperative communication and SSI. Adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that more case-relevant communication during the entire procedure was associated with a significant reduction in organ/space SSI (odds ratio 0.861, 95% confidence interval 0.750-0.987; P=0.034). Interestingly, case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure was associated with a significant increase of incisional SSI (odds ratio 1.1153, 95% confidence interval 1.040-1.196; P=0.002). Distractors such as noise and traffic were also assessed but had no effect on SSI. The current study is based on these observations, which reveal that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI and case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for SSI.

These findings can be interpreted in light of previous studies assessing communication in surgery and similar collaborative tasks which showed that explicit task-relevant communication fosters the development of a shared mental model of the task within the team. This facilitates coordination, because all team members are informed about the state of task progress, and can better anticipate their contribution. This is particularly important in critical phases of the procedure, as well as in OR teams composed of members with different levels of knowledge and expertise. Explicit task-related communication may be particularly useful to inform non-sterile team members (anesthetists, scrub nurses) that do not have full sight of the operative field at all times.

Although case-irrelevant communication in surgical teams has been found to foster a positive team-climate, it can be seen as a distractor if it diverts the attention away from the main task. This is more likely during the closing phase (last 20 minutes), because for most of the team members, the central task is already finished, and clearing and cleaning are routine tasks. If during routine tasks the team engages in too much non-patient relevant communication, attention to the closure may be diverted.

Given the previously found results, the introduction of a clinically applicable intervention (described below) has been tested in pilot studies. This intervention aims to assure a short discussion of case-relevant aspects at specific moments of the procedure, draw the attention of the on case-relevant communication during the main phase and to prevent a high increase in case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation.

Objective

To perform a prospective clinical trial to test the impact of structured intraoperative briefings on SSI. The incidence of SSIs will be compared before and after the introduction of this intervention.

Methods

- Intraoperative briefings: First briefing: after exposure of the organ of interest, Second briefing: Intraoperative briefing before closure of the operative field.

The current study is based on these observations, which reveal that case-relevant communication protects from organ/space SSI and case-irrelevant communication during the last 20 minutes of the procedure is a risk factor for SSI. These findings can be interpreted in light of previous studies assessing communication in surgery and similar collaborative tasks which showed that explicit task-relevant communication fosters the development of a shared mental model of the task within the team. This facilitates coordination, because all team members are informed about the state of task progress, and can better anticipate their contribution. This is particularly important in critical phases of the procedure, as well as in OR teams composed of members with different levels of knowledge and expertise. Explicit task-related communication may be particularly useful to inform non-sterile team members (anesthetists, scrub nurses) that do not have full sight of the operative field at all times. Although case-irrelevant communication in surgical teams has been found to foster a positive team-climate, it can be seen as a distractor if it diverts the attention away from the main task. This is more likely during the closing phase (last 20 minutes), because for most of the team members, the central task is already finished, and clearing and cleaning are routine tasks. If during routine tasks the team engages in too much non-patient relevant communication, attention to the closure may be diverted. Given the previously found results, the introduction of a clinically applicable intervention (described below) has been tested in pilot studies. This intervention aims to assure a short discussion of case-relevant aspects at specific moments of the procedure, draw the attention of the on case-relevant communication during the main phase and to prevent a high increase in case-irrelevant communication at the end of an operation. Objective To perform a prospective clinical trial to test the impact of structured intraoperative briefings on SSI. The incidence of SSIs will be compared before and after the introduction of this intervention. Methods - Intraoperative briefings: First briefing: after exposure of the organ of interest, Second briefing: Intraoperative briefing before closure of the operative field. * Trainings and Retrainings * Optional Interventions: Transparent drape between anesthesia and sterile team; Controlling noise and potential distractors during wound closure; Nutritional support during the operation Inclusion Criteria: * Patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery Exclusion Criteria * Preexisting surgical site infection"

Our aim was to determine the effect of a dietary iron education program (DIP) on children's iron status and intelligence quotient (IQ) score. This pre-test (week 1) post-test (week 16) quasi-experimental study with follow-up (week 18) utilized constructs from the Health Belief Model. Children and caregivers participated in the DIP which incorporated group talks, presentations, brainstorming, game-based learning and cooking sessions from weeks 2-15. Knowledge of ID and dietary iron, perceived susceptibility and severity, benefits and barriers for changing behavior, dietary intake, iron status and IQ score were determined at all timepoints (weeks 1, 16, and 18).","1. Objective The objective of this study was to determine whether an education-based dietary iron program that involved school teachers, parents and children could increase iron status and intelligence quotient (IQ) score in a group of schoolchildren.
2. Methods

2.1 Study design A quasi-experimental study (pre-test post-test design with follow-up) was used in this study that was based on the Health Belief Model as its theoretical framework.

2.2 Study Setting and Participants Child-parent/caregiver dyads were recruited from one purposively selected government-administered primary school in Phatthalung province. Schools were not involved in any other programs, located in a rural area, and had at least 200 children studying in grades 4-5. Hookworm screening was done 6 weeks before program implementation by the local government screening program. All children who were studying in grades 4-5 in the selected school were invited to participate. Out of 190 children, 34 children who were mildly anemic were enrolled in the study, together with their parents/caregivers. Sample size was calculated based on serum ferritin concentrations among school-aged children from a study by Rahman et al. \[17\]. Informed written consent was obtained from child-parent/caregiver dyads prior to program implementation.

2.3 Procedure for the intervention The Health Belief Model underpinned the development of the dietary iron program, which focused on the importance of adequate dietary iron consumption and emphasized prevention of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). It was implemented from weeks 2 to 15 of the study. Child-parent/caregiver dyads and teachers received an ID/IDA booklet that included information about anemia, causes of ID, iron-rich food, iron concentration in traditional foods, dietary enhancers and inhibitors of iron absorption, and recipes for iron-rich local and culturally appropriate meals for teachers, parents/caregivers and children, as part of the dietary iron program.

Teachers who were involved in school lunch design participated for discussing and planning iron-rich school lunch menus, and observed teaching and learning process with the use of media and games during the iron lessons for children. Four lessons were conducted for parents/caregivers. The first lesson was discussion that addressed parental perceptions about children's susceptibility to ID and IDA and the severity of ID and IDA concerning cognitive function. In the second lesson, parents/caregivers were asked to list the benefits and barriers for changing behavior with regards to preparing more iron-rich foods in the home. Then, the principal researcher invited parents/caregivers to brainstorm and share ways to overcome these barriers. Cooking classes for preparing iron-rich meals at home were conducted. Parents/caregivers voted for two iron-rich meals that they wanted to cook and then they prepared and cooked them in the classes. For the final lesson, the principal researcher visited each parent/caregiver to discuss the barriers they faced when trying to incorporate more iron-rich meals into their child's diet at home. Three lessons were conducted for the children, one per month. In the first lesson, group talks and games were used to engage the children about the causes and effects of ID and IDA. The second lesson focused on iron-rich food. After that, the children partook in games that entailed writing names of food ingredients that contained iron and circling pictures of iron-rich foods, and describing the sensations associated with consuming these foods. Both positive and negative answers from children were selected for discussion, and approaches for consuming more iron-rich food were brainstormed. A market assignment was set to help the children remember the names of iron-rich food and recognize the foods when they visited a market with their parents. The last lesson was a cooking class. After each cooking class finished, the researcher and a teacher encouraged them to eat this meal together.

2.4 Measurement outcomes The main outcome for this study was the effect of an education-based dietary iron program on iron status and intelligence quotient (IQ) score among children before program implementation (week 1) and at week 16 (immediately after program implementation) and at 18 weeks (follow-up appointment to determine the sustainability of the intervention). All of the outcome variables were measured at different time points. Children's knowledge towards ID and IDA was determined using a questionnaire, while children's iron intake was estimated by using three days of 24-hour recalls (2 school days and 1 weekend day). Portion sizes were estimated by using household portion sizes (rice-serving spoon, tablespoon, teaspoon and glass). IQ score was measured by a trained child psychologist by using the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) parallel version. Iron status was determined from blood samples drawn by medical technologists in the first-aid rooms. Concentration of hemoglobin, serum ferritin and serum C-reactive protein were measured by laboratory staff at hematology laboratory at N-health laboratory, Bangkok Dusit Medical Service Hospital (BDMS), Songkla province, using the hemoglobin assay kit (Colorimetric), chemiluminescent immunoassay (CMIA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein methods, respectively. Iron status was defined iron-replete: hemoglobin \>115 g/l and serum ferritin level \> 30 µg/l; anemia: hemoglobin \<115 g/l and serum ferritin level \>30 µg/l; mild-moderate iron depletion with anemia: hemoglobin 80-114 g/l and serum ferritin level \<30 µg/l.; mild iron depletion without anemia: serum ferritin level \< 30 µg/l and hemoglobin\>115 g/l. In addition, parents/caregivers were assessed by using a questionnaire toward knowledge and perceptions consisted of perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits and barriers in relation to ID and IDA.

2.5 Data Analysis Data from questionnaires were recorded using EpiData version 3.1, while 24-hour dietary recall data were entered into INMUCAL V3, which is a nutrient composition database of dietary items commonly consumed in Thailand. Portion sizes were converted into grams before entering data, and energy and nutrient intakes were calculated. Statistical analysis was carried out by using SPSS version 18. Frequencies, percentage, mean (SD) and median (25th-75th percentile) were calculated for demographic characteristics of participant knowledge, perceptions, iron intake, iron status, and IQ score. The One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA and Friedman's Two-Way Analysis of Variance by Ranks were used to compare mean differences in knowledge score and perception score of IDA and ID prevention among parents/caregivers, total iron intake, heme iron intake, non-heme iron intake, iron status and IQ score among children at different time points. The Monte Carlo exact test was used to compare the number of children in grades 4-5 who met/did not meet the Thai DRI for iron at pre-test, post-test and follow-up. Differences were considered to be significantly different when p\<0.05.
