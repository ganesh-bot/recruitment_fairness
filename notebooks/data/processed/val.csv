The intraoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) LightPath® Images will be used to inform the surgeons about detectable residual cancer, in an attempt to achieve better guided cancer surgery and complete tumour excision with clear WLE resection margins.

Study sites will use the local criteria considered standard of care to guide decisions to act on positive margins.

In the LightPath® arm the resection margin status of the WLE specimen, cavity shavings (if any) and the metastatic status of axillary (sentinel) lymph nodes as measured with the LightPath® Imaging System will be compared with histopathology results.","Female subjects with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer scheduled to have wide local excision (WLE) +/- sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) will be screened and receive 18F-FDG plus LightPath® Image. Subjects will have standard of care WLE. Extra cavity shaving due to positive 18F-FDG LightPath® Images is at the discretion of the surgeon.

Subjects will receive an intravenous injection of up to 5 MBq/kg, to a maximum 300 MegaBecquerel (MBq) of 18F-FDG prior to surgery.

Following resection, the WLE specimen will be examined using the LightPath® Imaging System. If the surgeons detect a positive signal they may perform cavity shavings of the resection cavity area corresponding to the positive signal area (up to a maximum thickness of 10mm).

Axillary SLNB will be performed according to local practice. At sites where 99mTc is used: In the 18F-FDG + LightPath® a higher dose of up to 150 MBq technetium-99m (99mTc) nanocolloid is necessary to avoid 18F-FDG masking the signal from 99mTc. Blue dye will be used according to local practice at sites where it is considered standard of care.

Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) will be examined using the LightPath® Imaging System. Where clinically indicated, ALND will be performed as per standard of care. At the time this protocol was finalised, LightPath® data involved lymph nodes sufficient to support recommendations were not available. For this reason, LightPath® Image results will not be used to direct ALND.

* compare the effects of dose-matched unilateral vs bilateral vs unilateral combined with bilateral upper limb rehabilitation based on task-related practice
* compare the effects of unilateral vs bilateral training based on robot-assisted devices
* study the predictors of treatment outcomes and clinimetric properties of the biomechanical measures","An estimated 30% to 66 % of stroke victims have poor upper extremity function at 6 months after stroke, which contributes to long-term disability in these patients. Training the affected UE of stroke patients has thus been a mainstay of neurorehabilitation. The goal of the intervention is to restore motor and daily functions. New therapeutic strategies have been developed based on principles of neurorehabilitation and motor learning. The need for comparative effectiveness research of the innovative treatments has been called for to promote evidence-based practice and translational science in stroke motor rehabilitation. Wolf and Whitall called for rigorous comparisons between unilateral and bilateral training. McCombe Waller and Whitall also indicated the importance of combining unilateral with bilateral training. For low-functioning patients, robot-assisted training is a possible approach. Identifying possible determinants for unilateral and bilateral training outcomes may also elucidate the factors that influence treatment outcomes. Outcome measures are required that have good clinimetric properties for measuring the effects of the rehabilitation strategies.

The long-term objective is to conduct comparative efficacy research to identify the possible mechanisms and the relative effectiveness of existing rehabilitation approaches of fully defined-, evidence-based, and theory-grounded approaches. This proposed project aims to (1) compare the effects of dose-matched unilateral vs bilateral vs unilateral combined with bilateral upper limb rehabilitation based on task-related practice; (2) compare the effects of unilateral vs bilateral training based on robot-assisted devices; and (3) study the predictors of treatment outcomes and clinimetric properties of the biomechanical measures. The outcome measures will span the spectrum of health-related functioning, including motor and neural control, movement performance, daily functions, and quality of life. Motor and neural control mechanisms involving movement strategies, muscle and force output, and brain reorganization will be evaluated using kinematic, electromyographic (EMG), and kinetic analyses, and also functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examinations. Clinical outcomes will include movement performance, daily functions, and quality of life, measured by MYOTON-3, Modified Ashworth Scale, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Wolf Motor Function Test, Functional Independence Measure, ABILHAND questionnaire, accelerometers, and Stroke Impact Scale. This 5-year project will recruit an estimated 200 patients with stroke. For Part 1, 120 patients with mild-to-moderate motor impairment will be randomized to the dose-matched unilateral, bilateral, or combined group. For Part 1, 80 stroke patients with moderate motor impairment will be randomized to the dose-matched unilateral or bilateral robot-assisted therapy group. Treatment regimens will be designed to ensure that patients in the 3 groups in Part 1 and 2 groups in Part 2 receive an equivalent intensity of treatment (5 days/week for 1.5 hours/day for 4 consecutive weeks). The intervention will be provided at 4 hospitals. Two certified occupational therapists will be trained in the administration of the 5 types of rehabilitation protocols by the PI and a co-PI and will complete a written competency test before subject treatment.

Biomechanical (kinematic, EMG, and kinetic) and fMRI examinations will be performed before, immediately after the 4-week intervention period, and at the 3-month follow-up period (no fMRI examination at follow-up). Clinical measures will be administered before, at midterm (2 weeks after intervention), immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. At least 3 examiners (1 research assistant, 1 graduate student, and 1 post-doc fellow) blind to group allocation will be in charge of biomechanical, fMRI, and clinical measures. Each type of measure will require 2 evaluators to collaborate for completing the assessment. Before being allowed to work with participants, the examiner's competence will be assessed by the PI and co-PI, and interrater reliability for clinical tests established.

Multivariate analysis of covariance will be used to examine changes in all outcome measures as a function of treatment while controlling for baseline data. Multiple regression models will be established to determine the potential predictors for different functional outcomes of each intervention (unilateral and bilateral training approach).

Chronic low back pain is a leading cause of disability, and although current FRP approaches have demonstrated benefits, there is limited research on the integration of emerging technologies like VR into these rehabilitation programs. The primary focus of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and usability of VR technology among both healthcare providers and patients involved in group-based FRP rehabilitation. Secondary objectives include assessing the potential effects of VR on reducing kinesiophobia, improving motor imagery abilities, reducing pain, and enhancing overall functional capabilities. Study Objectives: Primary Objective: To assess the acceptability of the immersive VR headset for healthcare providers managing patients with CLBP in the context of a group-based FRP. Secondary Objectives: - To evaluate the usability and adherence of patients to the VR program.- To measure the effects of the VR sessions on kinesiophobia, motor imagery abilities, pain levels, and functional capacities. - To explore the factors influencing healthcare providers' and patients' acceptance of the VR device in this rehabilitation setting. Study Design: This study is designed as a pilot, multicentric, prospective, and interventional trial. Participants will be recruited from healthcare centers within the Lombaction network, a research-driven initiative for the management and evaluation of CLBP. Patients will receive standard FRP rehabilitation, along with 3 weekly VR sessions designed to enhance motor function and reduce pain through specific exercises targeting the spine and trunk. The VR system used is an immersive, wireless headset, designed to allow a wide variety of movement and requires no external controllers. Intervention: Patients will receive the standard FRP rehabilitation, which includes a combination of physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, occupational therapy, adapted physical activity, and therapeutic education workshops. The VR intervention will involve the use of a headset with pre-programmed exergames designed to improve trunk movement (flexion, extension, rotation, etc.). Each session will last 20 minutes, with exercises lasting 5-7 minutes each, aligned with current best practices in rehabilitation. The VR device is designed to be intuitive, requiring minimal setup, and will be used in a dedicated space at the rehabilitation center. In addition to the regular rehabilitation program, participants will engage in VR sessions three times per week for the duration of the FRP, which lasts 4-5 weeks. The VR sessions are intended to complement and enhance the physical rehabilitation by promoting movement, addressing kinesiophobia, and providing immersive, distraction-based pain management. Data Collection: Data will be collected at several points throughout the study: Baseline: At the beginning of the FRP, all patients will complete several questionnaires, including the Dallas Pain Questionnaire (DPQ), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Low Back Imagery Questionnaire, and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to assess pain. During the program: Patients will complete VAS assessments before and after each VR session. Weekly adherence data will be collected, noting whether the VR session was completed and the reasons for any missed sessions. End of the program: At the end of the FRP, participants will complete the same questionnaires as at baseline, as well as an additional acceptability questionnaire, and the System Usability Scale (SUS) to assess the usability of the VR device. Conclusion. This pilot study is designed to explore the feasibility of incorporating immersive VR technology into an existing FRP for patients with chronic low back pain. The results will provide valuable insights into the acceptability, usability, and potential therapeutic effects of VR in a group rehabilitation setting.

In the literature, studies on myofascial induction therapy in patients with chronic low back pain are very limited and there is no study comparing therapeutic pain training.","Lumbar pain has become a major health problem which is growing and is very common in all societies and negatively affects the full well-being of the individual. It has been reported that 80% of the population experienced low back pain at any time in their lives. The prolongation of this painful process affects the physical, mental and psychological state of the patient and limits its daily functions. The acute or chronic pain determines the nature and duration of pain. Low back pain lasting 12 weeks or more is defined as chronic. In chronic diseases, lumbar pain, which is the first one, restricts the daily activities of the person due to current chronic pain or deterioration of functional status and causes loss of labor force.

Myofascial induction therapy is a therapy concept focused on optimizing function and balance within the fascial system. The approach aims at global recovery, local correction and painless body use.

Superficial procedures are directed to surface and / or local restrictions that can be directly detected by palpation. Deep myofascial induction therapy is a method that eliminates the limitations of the myofascial system and the three-dimensional pressures.

Therapeutic pain education is a training intervention that aims to reduce pain and disability by helping patients better understand the biological processes that support pain states. The neurobiology of pain and pain processed by the nervous system is explained to the patient in detail. Changes the patient's olab viewpoint to pain. For example, the patient believes that the cause of pain is caused by tissue damage. The patient who receives pain education understands that the cause of pain is the hypersensitive central nervous system. As a result, the patient's fear avoidance behavior decreases and he starts to move more easily.

OTHER,NCT00461279,Attachment Security as Mediator and Moderator of Outcome in Major Depression,Attachment Security as Mediator and Moderator of Outcome in Major Depression Following Interpersonal Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy,"In this study, the focus is on an individual's attachment security and its relation to treatment outcome in Major Depression.Adult attachment reflects how one seeks psychological and physical proximity to others for security and protection in times of stress. Researchers typically define four types of attachment security: one secure and three insecure (preoccupied, dismissing, and fearful). Adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) will be randomly assigned to either Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) or to Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). The expectation is that adults with avoidant attachment styles will respond better to CBT, and adults with preoccupied attachment styles will respond better to IPT. Also, in comparison to CBT, outcome in IPT is hypothesized to be more closely related to change in attachment.","At the current rate of increase, Major Depression, it will be the 2nd most disabling condition in the world by 2020, behind heart disease. There are now a number of effective treatments for depression. However, a significant number of people either partially recover from their depression after a course of treatment, or do not recover at all. For example, between 30% and 50% of depressed individuals taking an antidepressant are partially or totally resistant to the treatment, and more than ½ of patients in psychotherapy never achieve full remission. The goal of treatment of major depression should always be full remission. Not achieving full remission from depression is problematic as lingering symptoms are a powerful predictor of relapse.

One problem may be in the type of treatment that is offered to the individual. We know little about which clients benefit from which type of treatments and which clients do poorly. One individual may respond better to one type of treatment, while another individual may respond better to another type of treatment. The accurate identification of how an individual's characteristics interact with the type of treatment offered will help us match patients to the best-suited treatment for them, so we can optimize outcome.

One characteristic that may be related to treatment outcome is adult attachment security. Adult attachment reflects how one seeks psychological and physical proximity to others for security and protection in times of stress. Researchers typically define four types of attachment security: one secure and three insecure (preoccupied, dismissing, and fearful). Secure adults have a good sense of self-worth and are comfortable with intimacy. Preoccupied adults have an exaggerated desire for closeness and a heightened concern about rejection. Dismissing adults deny the value of close relationships and instead value self-reliance. Finally, fearful adults have a very negative sense of self and avoid intimacy because they fear rejection. Secure attachment has been linked to positive interpersonal relationships and psychological health and insecure attachment has been linked to overall psychological distress.

In this study, I focus on attachment security and its relation to treatment outcome. Adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) will be randomly assigned to either Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) or to Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). The expectation is that adults with avoidant attachment styles will respond better to CBT, and adults with preoccupied attachment styles will respond better to IPT. Also, in comparison to CBT, outcome in IPT is hypothesized to be more closely related to change in attachment.

The power of this study lies in its considered integration of three important issues at the forefront of mental health today: MDD, attachment, and treatment. MDD is a leading cause of disability worldwide and theoretically and empirically related to attachment. Attachment theory is a primary paradigm in the developmental, social/personality, and clinical literatures, and forms the theoretical cornerstone for IPT. IPT and CBT, while successful to a degree, fail or partially fail in many cases. Successful outcome in IPT depends on successfully improving a patient's attachment representations; this is not the case in CBT where change in depression is associated with change in cognition. The fact that these treatments represent contrasting approaches in the context of attachment, affords us a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between attachment and treatment outcome for two distinct treatments, and investigate whether an individual's attachment security interacts with the type of treatment offered to yield a better response for one type of treatment versus another. This research could have a major impact on tailoring treatment to patient characteristics to optimize treatment for major depression.",COMPLETED,,2006-08,2010-03,2010-02,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,134,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Cognitive Behavior Therapy"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Reframing and understanding cognitions of depression"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Interpersonal Psychotherapy"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Established psychotherapy for depression"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BEHAVIORAL;BEHAVIORAL,cognitive behavior therapy;interpersonal psychotherapy,1

OTHER,NCT02538679,A Comparison of Ultrasound Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Nerve Block Techniques,A Comparison of Ultrasound Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Nerve Block Technique Versus Laparoscopic Transversus Abdominis Plane Nerve Block Technique Versus No Block on Postoperative Opioid Consumption After Major Colorectal Surgery,"Postoperative pain can pose significant challenges in the postoperative recovery of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery. Traditionally, opioids have played an important role in treating postoperative pain. It is well established that opioids are highly effective in relieving pain; however opioids are associated with numerous side effects that include nausea, vomiting, constipation, ileus, bladder dysfunction, respiratory depression, pruritus, drowsiness, sedation, and allergic reaction. These opioid side effects, which range in severity, can significantly interfere with discharge home following colorectal surgery. Significant interest exists in the use of local anesthetic based regional anesthesia techniques as a means to extend the analgesic window for patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Specifically, the use of the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block as an adjunct in postoperative pain control has been widely reported in the anesthesia and colorectal surgery literature. Historically, the block was performed in a blind fashion with relative success and presently the block is typically performed either with ultrasound guidance or laparoscopic visualization. While TAP block has shown to be effective in post-operative pain control, the techniques used to place the block have not formally been compared.

The investigators are purposing a prospective, patient-blinded, randomized study of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery to compare TAP block under ultrasound guidance versus laparoscopic visualization versus no TAP block. The investigators hypothesize that laparoscopic-guided TAP block is non-inferior to ultrasound-guided TAP block with respect to perioperative pain control and either technique is superior to no TAP. In addition the investigators will measure procedural time, any adverse events related to the block, overall postoperative analgesic requirement, analgesic duration, postoperative pain scores, length of postoperative hospital stay, incidence of postoperative ileus, and overall patient satisfaction between the three groups.","The proposed study is a patient-blinded, prospective randomized study to compare ultrasound-guided block of the TAP versus laparoscopic-guided TAP block versus no TAP block in patients undergoing major colorectal surgery. The primary outcome measure is analgesic requirement in morphine equivalents in the first 24 hours after surgery. Secondary outcome measures include overall postoperative analgesic requirement, postoperative pain scores, length of postoperative hospital stay, any adverse events related to TAP block, overall perioperative complications in the 30-day postoperative period and overall patient satisfaction after major colorectal surgery.

All groups will receive general anesthesia as the primary mode of anesthesia. Patients randomized to one of two treatment arms will also undergo either ultrasound-guided or laparoscopic-guided TAP block in the operating room at the conclusion of the procedure. Patients randomized to no TAP will not have a TAP block performed but will receive all routine intraoperative and postoperative analgesia as deemed appropriate by the anesthesia and primary surgical team. A standardized preoperative non-opioid pain regimen will be utilized. In the recovery room, short acting opioids for breakthrough pain will be available. Opioids will also be administered for rescue if need be. All patients will receive postoperative intravenous narcotics via patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device.

STUDY METHODS

I. Recruitment

1. Patients of the investigators will be recruited for this study during their preoperative outpatient appointments approximately one week before surgery. The study material packet containing the HIPAA and the informed consent form will be emailed to the patient for review. Thus the patient will have adequate time to ask questions and consider the study prior to scheduled surgery.
2. The patients will be contacted by one of the study investigators the morning of surgery at which time a signed consent will be obtained.
3. Only patients who have provided their written consent and indicated that they have been introduced to the study prior to meeting with the anesthesiologists on the day of surgery will be able to participate.
4. Screening procedures will make sure patients meet all inclusion criteria.

II. In the preoperative holding area:

1. An anesthesia investigator assigned to the specific case will assess patients and perform a pre-operative anesthesia assessment as per standard protocol at Cedars Sinai Medical Center (CSMC). None of this data will be recorded until written informed consent is obtained.
2. Patients will provide a detailed medical history including demographic information (e.g., age, weight, height, ethnic origin, smoking history, history of motion sickness, history of postoperative nausea and vomiting, as well as chronic analgesic usage). None of this data will be recorded until written informed consent is obtained.
3. Written informed consent will be obtained by one of the investigators.
4. Patients will be randomized in a blinded fashion by study staff to one of the groups via online randomization site, sealedenvelope.com, in a 2:2:1 fashion.

Group 1 n=100 Ultrasound guided TAP Block Group 2 n=100 Laparoscopic guided TAP Block Group 3 n=40 No TAP

III. During the intraoperative period

1. Standard anesthesia monitors will be applied: automatic blood pressure cuff, three-lead electrocardiography, capnography, and pulse oximetry will be used continuously.
2. Induction of general gnesthesia will be with propofol 2-3 mg/kg \& a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (choice will be operator dependent). Maintenance of anesthesia will be with an inhalational anesthetic.
3. The study staff performing randomization will instruct the anesthesiologist or surgeon to either block the transversus abdominis plane with ultrasound, laparoscopy, or no block.
4. For the block, a standard weight based dose (bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:200,000, at a 1ml/kg dose) will be used for both ultrasound-guided or laparoscopic-guided block.
5. The block is administered between the costal margin and iliac crest in the anterior axillary line at 2 different sites on each side (4 injections total).
6. For ultrasound-guided TAP block, after the surgeons have completed their portion of the procedure, a member of the anesthesia research team will use sterile technique to prep the abdomen. The block is then placed bilaterally (at 2 different sites on each side of the abdomen) in the anterior axillary line, between the costal margin and iliac crest in the intermuscular plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles using ultrasound guidance.
7. For laparoscopic-guided TAP block, the attending surgeon will perform the block at the conclusion of the procedure under laparoscopic guidance. Bilateral TAP block will be performed in the anterior axillary line between the costal margin and iliac crest. After the needle is passed through the skin, it is continued until 2 distinct ""pops"" are felt, indicating the needle pierced each of the 2 fascia layers (external oblique and internal oblique fascia). After injection of the correct plane, a smooth raised area of fluid covered by transversus abdominis muscle is seen with the laparoscope. The laparoscopic vision also assures that the preperitoneal plane is not injected and that the injection does not go intraperitoneal.
8. Dose of anesthetics, analgesics, local anesthetics, and IV fluid therapy during the operation will be recorded in the anesthesia record as per standard procedure. A copy of the sonographic image will be collected for each patient at the conclusion of the block.
9. Duration of surgery (from skin incision until closure) and anesthesia (from induction of spinal until discontinuation of the anesthetic drug) will be recorded in the anesthesia record as per standard procedure.

IV. PACU

1. Verbal rating scale (VRS) for pain will be assessed by the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) nurse upon arrival to recovery room, then every 30min interval until discharge.

   o Requirements for ""rescue"" analgesic medication will be recorded before discharge.
2. Any adverse events during the perioperative period will also be noted by PACU RN.

V. Following completion of surgery (post-operative):

1. Anesthesia will be discontinued at skin closure.
2. Patients will be transferred to the recovery room after emergence from sedation
3. Treatment of surgical pain prior to discharge from the recovery room: moderate-to-severe pain (VRS \> 7): hydromorphone, 1-1.5 mg IV, moderate pain (VRS of 4-6): hydromorphone 0.5 - 1 mg IV., mild pain (VRS 2-3), hydromorphone 0.1-0.2 mg IV. Patient pain control medication will continue with the initial treatment medication for all subsequent rescue doses as needed until recovery room discharge.
4. Patient nausea, vomiting, or retching will be initially treated with ondansetron 4mg IV. Patients unresponsive to ondansetron will receive metoclopramide 10mg IV.
5. Patient discharge criteria from PACU will include: awake and alert, and has stable vital signs.

VI. Patient evaluation during hospital admission:

* VRS for pain assessment will be utilized to assess pain within the first 72 hours postoperatively and pain scores will be recorded in the patient chart by the nursing staff as per routine CSMC protocol. The average pain scores will be calculated for study analysis.
* VRS scores along with dose for all opioids will be recorded.
* Physical signs and symptoms related to the peripheral nerve block (residual sensory blockade) will be noted.
* Patient satisfaction with the overall technique will also be queried.

Pain evaluation recorded by nursing staff as per standard CSMC guidelines:

* At PACU every 30 minutes
* During admission: 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively

Patient satisfaction with analgesia will be assessed at the time of hospital discharge or within 30 days postoperatively by telephone using a patient satisfaction survey.",COMPLETED,,2015-08-07,2017-04-30,2017-04-30,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,TREATMENT,127,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Placebo"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""The usual intraoperative and postoperative pain control; NO TAP block performed"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""US TAP Bupivacaine/Epinephrine"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Ultrasound guided bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:400k will be injected to the transversus abdominis plane."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Lap TAP Bupivacaine/Epinephrine"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Laparoscopic guided bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:400k will be injected to the transversus abdominis plane."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER;DRUG;DRUG,placebo;us tap bupivacaine/epinephrine;lap tap bupivacaine/epinephrine,1

The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in patients treated by gemcitabine for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in term of overall response rate assessed after 4 cycles of treatment according to the international response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Lugano Classification 2014 - CT-Based Response).","Currently, there is no standard treatment for patients with recurrent or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma who relapse after a first line of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, oncovin, and prednisone (CHOP) treatment.

Chemotherapies such as gemcitabine are used as monotherapy but the results alone are insufficient. In addition, there is no approved monotherapy in the European Union, with the exception of brentuximab vedotin in refractory or recurrent large systemic anaplastic lymphomas.

Stem cell transplantation may be an option for patients who respond to a second line of treatment or a subsequent line of treatment, but conditions for being eligible for transplantation, including long-term remission, are infrequent.

Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is a targeted treatment directed against a protein, cluster of differentiation antigen 30 (CD30), present on the surface of lymphoma cells. It allows chemotherapy to enter directly into the lymphoma cell. The CD30 protein is variably expressed in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphoma; about 50% of patients have significant expression.

Data from clinical studies with brentuximab vedotin suggest that the addition of this treatment to gemcitabine may be more successful than gemcitabine alone.

The main hypothesis is a 15% increase in responder patients after 4 cycles of treatment with brentuximab vedotin and gemcitabine. The main objective of the study is therefore to determine the overall response rate after 4 cycles of treatment according to the criteria of Lugano 2014 (response based on CT-scan).

The secondary objectives will focus on the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin: complete response rate, response time for responder patients, time to failure of treatment, time to next treatment and overall survival, efficacy of brentuximab vedotin maintenance: survival progression-free, response time, overall survival, overall response rate based on positron emission tomography (PET)-scan and brentuximab vedotin toxicity in patients treated with gemcitabine and in maintenance therapy.

OTHER,NCT05451979,HIIT in Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients (MedBIKE™),High Intensity Interval Training in Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients: Evaluating a Novel Telemedicine Video Game-Linked Exercise Platform (MedBIKE™),"Heart transplantation is the long-term treatment for children and adults with advanced heart failure. Post-transplant outcomes have improved over time, such that 50% of pediatric heart transplant recipients (HTR) remain alive with a need for re-transplantation 17-years following the initial transplant. With improved short- and medium-term outcomes, focus has shifted towards optimizing long-term survival and reducing transplant-associated morbidities. This includes strategies aimed at optimizing cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity levels.

Pediatric and adult HTRs have reduced exercise capacity compared with the general population. Previous groups have shown gradual improvements in heart rate response to exercise and exercise capacity in pediatric HTRs. However, after an initial improvement, exercise capacity appears to plateau, or even decline in pediatric HTRs, and remains sub-optimal compared with the general population.

Most exercise interventions in HTRs to date have focused on moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), with some resistance components incorporated. More recently, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), consisting of short, intense bursts of exercise with rest periods, has been explored in the adult HTR population, with findings to date suggesting that it may yield greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness compared with MICE. Exercise interventions, particularly HIIT interventions, have consistently shown clinically important improvements in exercise capacity in adult HTRs that are linked with improved long-term post-transplant outcomes and well-being. Unfortunately, trials of exercise interventions in pediatric HTRs remain lacking. This study team is proposing an assessment of the feasibility of a home-based HIIT exercise program using a novel telemedicine-enable video game linked customizable cycle ergometer (MedBIKE™).","Purpose: To determine the feasibility of MedBIKE™ in a 12-week home-based high intensity interval training program in pediatric heart transplant recipients (HTRs).

Hypothesis: The MedBIKE™ intervention will be feasible, with adequate enrolment of eligible participants (\>60%), high session compliance (\>80%), and low-drop out rate (\~10%), with no adverse events directly related to the intervention. The investigators further hypothesize that the MedBIKE™ HIIT intervention will result in immediate and sustained improvements in exercise capacity, physical activity, self-efficacy towards physical activity, and HRQoL.

Justification: Clinical trials of exercise interventions in pediatric HTRs remains significantly lacking. This lack of literature to date has been identified as a significant knowledge gap in the Canadian Society of Transplantation/CAN-RESTORE recent joint statement. While the findings to date indicate that exercise interventions in pediatric HTRs may show improvements in exercise capacity, numerous knowledge gaps remain. For example, despite promising findings in adult HTRs, HIIT has not yet been studied in pediatric HTRs. Moreover, the effect of exercise interventions on physical activity, HRQoL, and self-efficacy towards physical activity have not been well studied. It is important to evaluate whether a supervised exercise intervention at near-maximal intensity can promote improvements in physical activity self-efficacy that may in turn yield sustained improvements in physical activity. One of the limiting factors for regular participation in post-transplant exercise programs is the necessary time commitment that is intensified in a program with demographics such as ours in Western Canada with many post-transplant children living far from the transplant center and with limited access to exercise facilities. A supervised home-based training program could optimize the time-efficiency and accommodate the patient's routine schedules. Thus, the investigators are proposing an assessment of the feasibility of a home-based HIIT exercise program using a novel telemedicine-enabled video game-linked customizable cycle ergometer (MedBIKE™).

Objectives: (Primary) Evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week, home-based HIIT MedBIKE™ intervention in pediatric HTRs. (Secondary) Evaluate the impact of the MedBIKE™ HIIT intervention on 1) exercise capacity; 2) physical activity; 3) self-efficacy towards physical activity; 4) HRQoL and 5) sustained changes in all secondary outcomes at 6- and 12-months post-intervention.

Research Method: Single-center, randomized crossover feasibility trial with a multi-method approach. Potential participants and families will be approached first by a clinical team member. Participants and parents expressing interest will meet with a research coordinator who, along with one of the investigators and the clinical team will screen for eligibility. Written consent and assent (if applicable) will be obtained from participants who are deemed eligible.

Following recruitment, participants will be administered the PedsQL and CSAPPA questionnaires, an accelerometer will be provided for seven days, and a baseline CPET will be performed or scheduled to occur following completion of the accelerometer assessment. Participants will then be randomized via a 1:1 allocation ratio with permuted blocks of randomly varied sizes either to the immediate MedBIKE™ arm or the immediate control arm (usual care) for 12-weeks, followed by a repeat assessment. Participants in the control arm will then cross-over and complete the 12-week MedBIKE™ HIIT program, followed by a repeat assessment at the completion of the intervention. All post-intervention assessments will occur 3-7 days post-MedBIKE™ intervention (to allow adequate recovery) and accelerometers will be programmed to commence counts 24 hours post-assessment to avoid bias from fatigue from the CPET. Participants will then return for final assessments at 6- and 12-months post-MedBIKE™ intervention. Whenever possible, follow-up assessments will be coordinated with clinical appointments (pediatric HTRs are typically clinically assessed every 3-4 months or more frequently).

The MedBIKE™ program is a first-person interactive videogame in which the participant is 'biking' around a safari collecting animals and will enter a wormhole when completing the high-intensity exercise portion. The participant and clinician applications are Windows WPF applications that run on windows 10 PCs. The participant application also includes a companion app that runs on an Android table. The MedBIKE™ service application is a platform-independent Python application that is run on a a secure Ubuntu Linux instance operated by the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry IT department.

A follow-up assessment, identical to that of the baseline (questionnaires, CPET, interviews and a 7-day week wear of an accelerometer) will occur 3-14 days post-intervention. These assessments will be repeated at 6- and 12-months post-intervention.

Plan for Data Analysis: The WHCRI biostatistics group will provide statistical and data analysis support. Continuous data will be summarized as median with first and third quartiles and changes in pre- and post-intervention measures will be evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical data will be presented by absolute and relative frequencies (n and %).

Baseline/Initial Visit (Visit 1):

At this visit, the start of the study, the information described in the ""Baseline Assessments"" section will be collected. The study will be re-described to the participant. The study team will then set up the device for the individual patient by making adjustments (as needed) to address patient specific anatomy, ensuring that the sensors are all contacting the appropriate chest areas, and confirming the measurements on the CPM Web application. The patient will be shown how to apply and replace the adhesive on the device, how to position the device, how to take a measurement with the device, and how to store the device on the Base Station. The trained provider will then register the baseline reading for the CPM device using the CPM Mobile App. Informational material about using the device, refreshing adhesives, and interpreting device LEDs and chimes will be provided to each patient. Each patient will be reminded to take a measurement with their CPM at the same time each day (preferably when they first wake up) and instructed to follow the medical regimen prescribed by their physician.

Between Visits:

Between visits, caregivers will not have any access to the data being collected on the CPM System. They should perform their usual standard of care on these patients. Participants will receive one call from the study team after 1 week of monitoring to check in about the progress of the study (i.e. if protocols are being followed correctly, if the CPM device is working properly, and if adherence is satisfactory). If the participant is found to have problems with the device, a follow up at week 2 can be scheduled. The check-in conversation topics should focus on any ease of use issues and address any technical barriers impacting compliance.

Follow-up Visit (Visit 2):

On this visit, which will take place at the end of the 5 months, the study team will make arrangements for the patient to return to the office for a check-up and return the device (the same tests as described in the ""physical examination"" section). Patients will also be asked about their perception on ""ease of use"", impact on day to day activities, and overall satisfaction with the CPM system. Thirty days following the last measurement the study team, will review the patients records for all HF related events and treatment changes. Study protocol will also include a phone call to the patient to inquire if they had any heart failure events during this time.

Post-Monitoring (Data review):

After the completion of the monitoring, the study team will analyze the de-identified data from the CPM system and correlate it with clinical events obtained from patients and their medical records.

OTHER,NCT06142279,Development and Qualification of Methods for Analyzing the Mucosal Immune Response to COVID-19,Development and Qualification of Methods for Analyzing the Mucosal Immune Response to COVID-19,"The pandemic associated with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has affected over 760 million individuals worldwide, resulting in more than 6.9 million deaths. France has also been heavily impacted, with over 39.8 million infections and 167,000 deaths.

SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes an upper respiratory tract infection transmitted through the air. When it reaches the lungs, it leads to a severe acute respiratory illness called COVID-19. The body's response to this viral assault primarily occurs at the level of the respiratory mucosa.

This mucosal response is complex, involving various levels of activity. Mucosal immunity is therefore essential for an adequate and long-term immune response against viral respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 triggers a humoral immune response with the production of antibodies in the blood (serum antibodies) and antibodies in the upper respiratory tract (mucosal antibodies). It also induces a cellular immune response by activating specific blood T lymphocytes.

Tests used to measure the humoral blood response against SARS-CoV-2 and their neutralizing capacity are now well identified, as are tests for assessing the serum cellular T lymphocyte response. However, tests for measuring mucosal immune responses are not routinely used.

Our study aims to develop and qualify methods for analyzing mucosal immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2. These methods will be essential for a more precise analysis of the body's mucosal response to this virus.

Once these analytical methods are validated, they will enable the study of mucosal responses to infection, as well as mucosal responses induced by vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the context of future nasal vaccine use.","SARS-CoV-2 is initially responsible for an airborne infection of the upper respiratory tract which, on reaching the lungs, causes a severe acute respiratory illness known as COVID-19.

The organism's response to this viral aggression is initially directed at the respiratory mucosa.

This mucosal response is complex, with different levels of activity interacting: mechanical activity, with the secretion of mucus that acts as a barrier to the infectious agent; physico-chemical activity, with the production of enzymes and cytokines that contribute to the degradation of viral particles; and specific humoral immune activity, with the production of secretory IgA-type immunoglobulins at the mucosal level, with neutralizing activity that blocks viral entry into the host cell.

These innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, together with their humoral and cellular components, play an essential role in mucosal barrier function. Mucosal immunity is therefore essential for an adequate, early and long-term immune response against respiratory viral infections.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a helical capsid and a genome consisting of approximately 30,000 nucleotides. This genome codes for several proteins essential for virion formation, including the S protein for Spike and the N protein for nucleocapsid.

The viral S protein binds to the host cell's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 thus acts as a viral receptor mediating viral entry into the cell and the triggering an immune response in the host. This protein S is the main target of the neutralizing antibody response. Mutations in protein S have been responsible for the emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 with different phenotypes affecting transmission and susceptibility to antibody.

The N protein is a highly immunogenic glycoprotein also involved in viral replication and in the modulation of cellular signalling pathways. During virion assembly virion, the N protein binds to viral RNA and leads to the formation of the helical nucleocapsid. This N protein is highly conserved in all SARS-CoV-2 variants and may therefore be an interesting target in the universal defense against this virus.

In the event of a respiratory infection, stimulation of the mucosal immune system triggers on the one hand, a humoral response with the release of secretory immunoglobulins, mainly secretory IgA. The main role of IgA is to prevent the virus from spreading throughout the body.

On the other hand, respiratory infection will also trigger a mucosal cellular response primarily mediated by T lymphocytes.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 triggers an immune response involving antibody production in the blood (serum antibodies), stimulation of blood lymphocytes and antibody production in the upper respiratory tract (mucosal antibodies). The quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response in the blood (serum antibodies) has been assessed by various tests. For the time being, however, it relies mainly on EIA-type tests, with blood levels of anti-S IgG (directed against the Spike protein) and anti-N IgG (directed against the nucleocapsid protein). Qualitative analysis of this response is based on the ability of these antibodies to have neutralizing activity (neutralizing antibodies).

The anti-SARS-CoV-2 T lymphocyte cellular response also appears to be important in controlling infection. The most rapid test for assessing this T lymphocyte response is the ELISPOT IFN-γ

As for the mucosal humoral response, several studies have documented the presence of virus-specific anti-S IgA antibodies (directed against the Spike protein) in the nasopharyngeal secretions or saliva of infected individuals. To date, there is no routinely-used test for measuring mucosal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, notably secretory anti-S IgA, and to analyze their neutralizing activity.

Our study will thus enable us to develop and qualify methods for analyzing mucosal immunity to SARS-CoV-2. These methods will be essential for analyzing mucosal response to this virus.

Once these analytical methods have been validated, they will make it possible to study the mucosal response to infection but also the mucosal response induced by vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, particularly when using nasal vaccines.

Indeed, the vaccines currently used to combat SARS-CoV-2 induce serum neutralizing activity against protein S (Spike). Their intramuscular route of administration will induce systemic immunity, providing protection against severe forms of the infection. Nevertheless, mucosal immunity induced by current vaccines remains low. The development of a nasally-administered vaccine is an interesting avenue, as it would provide more complete protection, notably by controlling virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, thus inducing upper respiratory tract, thereby inducing herd immunity and reducing transmission of the virus.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2023-11,2024-11,2024-11,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,240,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Sampling"", ""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""description"": ""At baseline, nasal, salivary and blood sampling will be taken for the participants."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""PCR (polymerase chain reaction) SARS-CoV-2"", ""type"": ""BIOLOGICAL"", ""description"": ""At baseline, this PCR SARS-CoV-2 will be taken for the participants."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",BIOLOGICAL;BIOLOGICAL,sampling;pcr (polymerase chain reaction) sars-cov-2,0
OTHER,NCT05333679,Urine Tenofovir Point-of-care Test to Identify Patients in Need of ART Adherence Support (UTRA Study),Urine Tenofovir Point-of-care Test to Identify Patients in Need of ART Adherence Support (UTRA Study),"ART is given to people living with HIV in order to suppress the virus, resulting in improved health for the individual and decreased transmission of the virus to others. Success of ART is dependent on adherence. Currently, adherence is assessed by asking patients directly and then confirming with a viral load test, which is expensive and is often only done when the viral load is already raised. Therefore there is a need to find a method to detect problems with adherence early before the viral load rises.

A urine-based test was recently developed, called UTRA (urine tenofovir rapid assay). This test can give clinic staff immediate results about a person's adherence to the antiretroviral medication Tenofovir (TDF). The study will compare the results of this urine test to drug levels found in blood, self-reported adherence and pharmacy collection records to see if this test can be used as part of routine care in ART clinics. If the test is effective it would allow clinic staff to identify people with adherence difficulties early and give them the necessary support before their viral load rises.","This is a randomised study, recruiting 200 people taking TDF-based ART. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to intervention versus standard enhanced adherence counselling. Intervention participants will receive an adherence support package informed by feedback from the urine-based test. The investigators will assess the impact of the adherence test on VL suppression rates in each arm (without necessitating a regimen switch) at 12 months after enrolment. Enrolling participants with adherence challenges increases efficiency and mirrors the population requiring adherence support in our setting.

The UTRA device used for this study has received a FDA Non-Significant Risk (NSR) designation and is IDE exempt.

FEASIBILITY:

The investigators will track retention in the study among participants in each arm, missed visits, and the number of urine assessments performed in the intervention arm.

ACCEPTABILITY:

All participants enrolled will also complete a standardised questionnaire about the acceptability of the adherence support they received. This measure of acceptability will be assessed as a secondary outcome by arm, along with socio-demographics profiles associated with low/high acceptability described within arm.

QUALITATIVE PROCEDURES:

1. Participant in-depth interviews: Qualitative data will include in-depth interviews of participants (n\~20; \~3-4 interviews with each participant over 6-9 months of their treatment) using semi-structured guides conducted by experienced socio-behavioural scientists. The semi-structured interview guide will elicit feelings about the urine adherence metric and counseling messages, concerns regarding privacy, advantages/disadvantages of receiving such results, and the likely impact of this monitoring test on sustained adherence to ART or just on short-term adherence. Interviews will be conducted in participants' preferred language.
2. Health care worker interviews: The investigators will additionally assess the feasibility of the intervention by interviewing health care providers, who will be administering the UTRA test at the clinical point of care in the future. The study will examine provider perceptions of the assay at the end of the study using in-depth interviews (n\~10), assessing perceived usefulness, complexity to use, stigma/social harm, and benefits.

This study seeks to develop and evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of an innovative gender transformative implementation strategy to improve HIV provider capacity for equitable HIV care and ART adherence counseling.","Antiretroviral treatment (ART) is the single most effective clinical intervention in the fight against HIV. However, in Uganda only 56% of people living with HIV were virally suppressed in 2017 with significant disparities between men and women, suggesting problems with implementation. While gender norms are a known driver of HIV disparities in sub-Saharan Africa, and patient-provider relationships are a key factor in HIV care engagement, little research has focused on the role that gender norms have in shaping the equitable provision of treatment and quality of ART counseling. The overall research objective is to develop and pilot test an implementation strategy to increase providers' capacity to provide equitable and gender-tailored treatment and counseling to HIV-infected men and women.

Delivered to HIV providers, this group training integrates a gender transformative approach with adapted evidence-based strategies to reduce biases and increase gender equitable attitudes. The pilot trial will assess the implementation strategy's effectiveness by comparing changes in provider (competence for gender sensitive care) and in patient outcomes (clinic attendance, ART adherence, viral load) between the training intervention and usual care through 12-months.

The implementation strategy will be assessed through a quasi-experimental pre/post design. Clinics will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control condition. Providers in the intervention condition will receive a series of group training sessions.

The population of the studywas the TKA patients operated at Kastamonu State Hospital (N=209); the sample with quota sampling was a total of 46 patients, including 23 selected 23 control group. Data collection forms for data collection, tympanic thermometer, saturation meter, sphygmomanometer, woolen blankets and electric blankets were used in research process.The data collected in this study were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 software. To analyze the data; descriptive statistics, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, X2, Student's t, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance ANOVA and linear regression analysis were used. According to the results; it was determined that the use of electric blankets together with woolen blankets was an efficient method of warming for TKA patients and unheated woolen blanketsare not sufficient to improve body temperature postoperatively. Studying with large samples and assessing the effectiveness of warmed woolen blankets with determining the number of warmed woolen blanket for enhancing the control of hypothermia is suggested.","Methods 2.1. Study Design and Setting As a parallel group, randomized controlled trial with repeated measures to test the following hypothesis: the average body temperature of patients who use an electric blanket along with a woolen blanket reaches a normal value at least one timeframe (15 minutes) before that of patients who use a woolen blanket. It was used electric blankets for the patients in the experimental group in addition to the routine practices in the clinic and did the routine practice in the clinic for the patients in the control group by the researcher.

The study was conducted in the orthopaedic clinic of a public hospital in Turkey with the capacity to serve 100.000 patients, where approximately 250 TKA operations are performed per year.

2.2. Sample Sample of the study included patients who had TKA under spinal and/or epidural anesthesia. Sample size calculation was performed using the Number Cruncher Statistical System (NCSS)-Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS) software. Based on the differences in the mean scores of body temperatures for seven different times (before surgery, taking to their beds after surgery, 15th minutes, 30th minutes, 45th minutes, 60th minutes and 75th minutes after surgery) obtained from the patients in the pilot study, the alpha level was set at 0.05 and power as 80%. Thus, 23 patients were included in each group (23 patients in the experimental group and 23 patients in the control group). The patients were selected according to age and gender (each group: male: 4, female: 9 between 60- 69 ages; male: 3, female: 7 between 70-79 ages) and were randomized according to days of the week.

2.3. Participants and Procedure The inclusion criteria for this study were: being between the ages of 60 to 79, having an SPO2 value above 90% when they were hospitalized, no having diseases affecting cognitive functions or thermoregulation due to systemic effects, and no using any medication which could effect thermoregulation. Additionally, new patients were selected for the sample in place of patients who wished to withdraw from the study since they felt uncomfortable by the way the blanket was placed on them or were uncomfortable being uncovered above their wrists or ankles or lower than the bottom line of the clavicle, or who needed to remove the blanket completely because of the clinical interventions, or who had to be taken to the intensive care unit due to the unexpected changes in their general condition. Four different surgical teams and one single anesthesia team were performed the TKA surgeries in this hospital. The anesthesia team administered the same anesthetic medication as a spinal or local combined (spinal and epidural) to all patients in the sample.

The study was conducted between November 1, 2013, and May 1, 2014. The researcher (ED) informed the nurses in the clinic about the procedures to be done for the experimental and control groups. The day before the application of this study, the researcher reviewed the list of the operations to be performed the next day and identified patients who would have TKA. The researcher also evaluated the fitness of these patients to sample criteria and patients were informed both verbally and in written form. After obtaining informed consent, it was measured patients' height and weight, recorded their demographic data, family history, medical history and the taking medication on a descriptive characteristics information form (DCIF) by the researcher. The researcher measured the patients' body temperatures in the same ear in which their body temperatures were measured when they had been hospitalized. The researcher evaluated whether there were earpieces, infections or external auditory canals for plugs in deciding in which ear to measure the body temperature. To measure the pulse, arterial blood pressure and SPO2, it was used the arm that did not have established vascular access. It was obtained the temperature and humidity of the operating room one hour after each patient was taken to surgery and recorded this information on the DCIF.

In addition, a woollen blanket used in the clinic was laid on the bed while control group patients were in the operating room. For experimental group patients, an electric blanket was placed under the mattress and a wool blanket on the bed sheet while they were in the operating room. The electric blanket was operated at ""hot"" level for 20 minutes before the experimental patient left the operation room.

After the patients were taken to their own beds after surgery, the researcher covered them with a wool blanket from the top of clavicle to the bottom of their feet, put the sphygmomanometer on the arm without an IV line, positioned the sphygmomanometer so that the instrument panel was on the blanket and measured the patients' blood pressure. Then, the electric blanket was operated at the ""warm"" level for the experimental group, and it was turned off and unplugged when their body temperature reached 36.0 °C.

After each measuring of vital signs, it was recorded the responses ""very little"", ""a little"" and ""very much"" as ""Yes"", and the responses ""no"" and ""no, I don't"" as ""No"" by asking whether they felt cold or not. The researcher put the SPO2 probe on the patients' fingers after blood pressure measurements and counted respiratory rates for one minute while waiting for the SPO2 measurements. During the SPO2 measurement, it was noted if patients did not move, did not have nail polish, henna or any other paint on their finger on which the measurement was made, whether the pigmentation of the skin was not different from other body sites, and whether the measurement site was not colder than other body sites19. To prevent light in the room from affecting the measurement, the woolen blanket was placed on the patients' hands in a way so as not to prevent reading the measurement value after the saturation probe was placed on the finger. The patients' body temperatures were measured in the ear recorded on the DCIF. The ear was pulled back and entered at a right angle. After this measurement, the researcher evaluated shivering by observation, and recorded these data on the DCIF.

Finally, it was read the temperature and humidity in the room on a thermohygrometer and recorded the measurement on the evaluation form by the researcher. The researcher measured body temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate, arterial blood pressure, pulse pressure, oxygen saturation, feeling cold and shivering of experimental and control group before their surgeries, every 15 minutes after surgeries until being 36 0C of body temperature.

2.4. Measurements To collect the data, a descriptive characteristics information form was used, which was developed in accordance with the literature (Lundgren et al., 2011, O'Malley et al., 2012, Pulido et al., 2008). Tools included a tympanic thermometer (Kendall), saturation measurement device (pulse oximeter), sphygmomanometer (Omron), woolen blanket and electric blanket.

2.5. Analysis The descriptive statistics of the study are presented as means, standard deviations and frequency and percentages. The presence of a normal distribution was determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data was evaluated as using the chi-square test to compare categorical data in contingency tables, the Student's t test for normally distributed variables in comparing differences between the groups, the Mann-Whitney-U test for variables not normally distributed, one-way ANOVA for normally distributed variables in the comparison of more than two groups and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance when the variable was not normally distributed.

OTHER,NCT06714279,Laparoscopic-Assisted Transversus Abdominus Plane Block Versus Intraperitoneal Irrigation of Local Anesthetic for Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy,"Laparoscopic-Assisted Transversus Abdominus Plane Block Versus Intraperitoneal Irrigation of Local Anesthetic for Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy - a Prospective, Randomised Clinical Trial","This study is being performed to investigate whether the administration of local anaesthetic into the muscles in the abdomen or onto squirting the local anaesthetic onto the liver following keyhole gallbladder surgery is more beneficial in reducing pain post-operatively.

Keyhole gallbladder surgery is typically performed under general anaesthesia (or while the patient is 'fully asleep'), however doctors use other pain relief types to reduce pain after the operation. One of these options is local anaesthetic, which involves the injection of an medication into or onto the part of the body which has been operated on. The reason for doing this is to reduce the pain felt by the patient in the part if the body where the operation occurred. The best way of using these medications remain unclear.

The local anaesthetic being used in the study is fully approved for use in Ireland and the drug itself is not being tested. In other words, the drug is not an experimental drug. Local anaesthetic drugs are given in different ways in patients who have just had the keyhole surgery on their gall bladder (this is the surgery that you are about to have).

Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare two ways of giving patients these local anaesthetic medications following key-hole gallbladder surgery. These include (1) injecting the medication into the skin at the surgical wounds and squirting it onto the liver (where the gallbladder has been removed from), or (2) injecting the medication into the skin at the surgical wounds and into the muscles in the abdomen (known formally as a transversus abdominus plane block).","Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the cornerstone in treating benign diseases of the gallbladder and biliary tree, with approximately 5,000 of these procedures being performed annually in the Republic of Ireland. While significant complications, including bile leak, common bile duct injury (CBDI), and converting to an open incision, are typically discussed in detail when counselling patients in the preoperative setting, post-operative pain in the first 24-hours after surgery remains the main barrier of early discharge following the procedure. To counteract this issue, multimodal analgesic strategies have practically been adopted to minimise post-operative pain following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, as outlined by the Procedure Specific Post-Operative Pain Management (PROSPECT) in their review and recommendations. More specifically, the PROSPECT guidelines provide GRADE A recommendations in support of both standard paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (or cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitors), combined with surgical site local anaesthetic infiltration in patients in the peri-operative setting 'as the first line for routine use'.

Despite these recommendations, there remains ambiguity in the surgical literature surrounding to the optimal strategy for the infiltration of local anaesthetic; previous data has coherently demonstrated the superiority of surgical site wound infiltration, intraperitoneal infiltration and intra-abdominal wall blocks with local anaesthetic agents in reducing post-operative pain relative to placebo. In particular, data from a previous randomised clinical trial (RCT) has indicated that infiltrating the gallbladder fossa with local anaesthetic is more effective in reducing post-operative pain than local wound infiltration, however these results were subsequently refuted in a sequential RCT, leaving ambiguity as to the effect of this technique in reducing post-operative pain. Furthermore, recent RCTs have demonstrated that infiltration of local anaesthetic into either transversus abdominus plane (TAP) or the rectus sheath intraoperatively reduced post-operative pain compared to infiltration into the wound alone, directly reducing the post-operative morphine requirement. While ultrasound-guided transversus abdominus plane (US-TAP) are now commonly utilised in the perioperative setting following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the suitability of a laparoscopic-guided approach (L-TAP) has been less well established within the surgical literature.

Given the contrasting results of these previous studies, there remains no consensus as to the validity of using L-TAP or intraperitoneal infiltration of local anaesthetic to the liver bed as contemporary modes of delivering local anaesthetic following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to perform a prospective, randomised study evaluating the benefit of L-TAP or intraperitoneal infiltration in patients indicated to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study is a parallel two-arm study which will evaluate outcomes following local anesthetic infiltration (1) directly into the laparoscopic port sites combined with intraperitoneal infiltration, and (2) directly into the laparoscopic port sites combined with laparoscopic infiltration via TAP block.",NOT_YET_RECRUITING,,2025-01,2025-01,2025-01,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE1,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,NONE,TREATMENT,144,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Tap Block - Bupivacaine"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""The medicinal product for both groups is the same - Bupivacaine.

Patients will be randomised to surgery with either a Taylor Spatial Frame (Smith \& Nephew, England) or a reamed intramedullar nail (according to local choice) with locking screws. Primary outcome measure is the physical component summary (PCS) of RAND Short form 36 (SF-36) after 2 years.

According to our fracture register 95 patients with closed tibia fractures were operated the last 3 years at our department. Fractures with moderate or no displacement can be successfully treated with a cast and subsequent Sarmiento brace. Displaced fractures are commonly treated with an intramedullary nail. Intramedullary nailing yields a high rate of union. More than 50 % of operated patients do, however, develop chronic anterior knee pain and one third of the patients have pain at rest. This contributes a big problem for many patients both at spare time and at work. Another problem is significant rates of malunion.

The use of ring fixators utilizing rings and 1,8 mm. wires was introduced by Gavril Ilizarov more than 50 years ago, and the technique has been further developed through the introduction of six adjustable struts (Taylor Spatial Frame). This hexapod circular frame allows accurate reduction as well as a high stability. The ring fixator is less invasive and allows early weight bearing, but may be cumbersome to the patient. There is also concern about pin-tract infection, osteomyelitis and joint contracture.

OTHER,NCT01679379,Wound Infection in Obese Women After Cesarean Delivery,Surgical Site Infection in Obese Women After Cesarean Section; A Randomized Controlled Trial of Absorbable Versus Non Absorbable Sutures for Skin Closure.,The purpose of this study is to determine the surgical site infection rate and patient satisfaction for absorbable versus non absorbable suture in closure of skin at cesarean section in obese women.,"Cesarean section (CS) is the commonest major operation performed on women in the world. Approximately one in 4 women in the United States is delivered by cesarean section, and it is well established that operative abdominal delivery is associated with a significant risk of infection compared with vaginal delivery. These risks are increased with preexisting operative site infection, breaks in sterile technique, prolonged preoperative admissions that may result in colonization with resistant microbes, prolonged operative duration, use of electrocautery, obesity, advanced age, inadequate host immunocompetence.

Obese women may have increased susceptibility to infections because of the effects of obesity on the immune system, skin barriers, wound healing, mobility, and coexisting chronic diseases including diabetes, which could increase infection risk by itself. Cohort studies have shown that women with a body mass index (BMI)\>30kg/m\^2 have a two to three folds increased risk of post cesarean infections, such as wound infection, urinary tract infection UTI), endometritis, or pneumonia, compared with non-obese women. Other studies found that obesity doubled the risk specifically for post-cesarean wound infection.

Wound complications are a major source of morbidity after CS and contribute to prolonged hospital stay and rates of readmission. Age, (BMI), length of incision, and timing of prophylactic antibiotic administration have all been associated with post cesarean surgical site infection (SSI).

A surgical site infection is an infection that occurs after surgery in the part of the body where the surgery took place. SSI can sometimes be superficial infections involving the skin only. Other surgical site infections are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs, or implanted material. SSI has a great impact on the economy and health care resources. Infection has always been a feature of modern surgery and continues to be a significant problem for health care practitioners across the world.

The ideal skin closure would be safe and effective, associated with minimal patient discomfort, and have a good cosmetic result. It would also be inexpensive and require fewer health care resources by being fast and easy to apply, require minimal follow-up evaluation, and be associated with a low rate of complications.

Methods for closing the skin at the time of cesarean delivery include stainless steel staples, subcuticular absorbable staples, subcuticular suture, adhesive closure strips, and tissue adhesives (cyanoacrylates). Each of the methods has its postulated benefits for wound outcomes; however, none of these have been compared in a prospective trial.

The role of skin closure suture material on wound complication rates in Obstetrics is poorly studied. And when we are talking about obese patients we did not find any recommendation regarding the suture material of skin closure although most of Obstetricians use different sutures materials.

Does closure of skin by absorbable compared to non absorbable suture affect the rate of surgical site infection in obese patients undergoing caesarian section? Our hypothesis is that no difference between absorbable compared to non absorbable suture.",COMPLETED,,2012-07,2013-05,2013-04,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,PREVENTION,200,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Absorbable suture group"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""Skin is closed with subcuticular stitches using \\[Polyglactin 910 absorbable, synthetic, braided suture\\]"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Non absorbable suture group"", ""type"": ""PROCEDURE"", ""description"": ""Skin is closed with subcuticular stitches using Polypropylene non absorbable monofilament suture"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",PROCEDURE;PROCEDURE,absorbable suture group;non absorbable suture group,1

Around 712,000 sprains occur every day in the world. It is estimated that they account for 45% of sports injuries, being the second part of the body that is most frequently injured in sports. Of the patients who suffer this injury, around 70% will develop chronic ankle instability, a situation that can cause residual pain, recurrent sprains, a feeling of lack of stability and decreased physical activity.

Two entities can be included in chronic ankle instability: mechanical instability, which involves movement of the joint beyond its physiological limit, and functional instability, which includes proprioceptive dysfunction, impaired neuromuscular control, postural control, and strength deficits.

Currently, the conservative treatment of these patients consists of neuromuscular training through the use of dynamic balance platforms, taping, joint mobilization, dry needling, and the use of plantar supports, balance training being the one that has shown the best result.

Leuprolide is in a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GNRHa). It prevents the body from making luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This causes the testicles to stop making testosterone (a male hormone) in men and may stop the growth of prostate tumor cells that need testosterone to grow. Abiraterone acetate, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body. Relugolix, a GNRH antagonist, works by decreasing the amount of testosterone produced by the body. This may slow or stop the spread of prostate tumor cells that need testosterone to grow. The use of hormone therapy with radiation therapy has been shown to improve survival, however, studies have suggested that the addition of hormone therapy may worsen heart (cardiac) disease and high blood pressure. In fact, studies have shown that the most common cause of death in prostate cancer patients is due to heart disease or heart attacks. Computed tomography (CT) scans create a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body; the pictures are created by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. In this study, sophisticated cardiac CT images are used to take pictures of patients' heart and coronary arteries to help assess damage to the heart. Using cardiac CT and blood tests, this trial may help doctors determine which patients are at risk of cardiac disease when treated with combination hormone therapy, as well as the differential risk of leuprolide versus relugolix in combination with abiraterone acetate.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Measure cardiovascular outcomes between combination gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GNRHa, i.e. leuprolide) plus abiraterone acetate (AA) versus gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist (GNRH-antagonist, i.e. relugolix) plus AA in men with advanced prostate cancer receiving definitive radiation therapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Identify genomic alterations that predispose an individual to enhanced cardiovascular (CV) toxicity following hormone therapy with leuprolide or relugolix in combination with abiraterone acetate.

II. Evaluate serum testosterone kinetics during and after treatment with combination leuprolide+AA versus relugolix+AA.

Patients may also receive bicalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 21-30 with first injection of leuprolide at the discretion of the treating provider. All patients undergo pre-treatment and 12-month coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and blood sample collection.

OTHER,NCT05047679,The Effectiveness of Pain Neuroscience Education in At-risk Patients Following Surgery for Lumbar Radiculopathy,The Effectiveness of Pain Neuroscience Education in Patients at Risk for Unfavorable Outcome Following Surgery for Lumbar Radiculopathy: A Multicentric Randomized Controlled Trial,"This study aims to assess the effectiveness of perioperative pain neuroscience education (PPNE) in patients who are at risk for unfavorable outcome following surgery for lumbar radiculopathy. Although most of these surgeries are successful, 23-28% of patients report chronic pain and disability following surgery. Many preoperative factors are associated with an unfavorable surgical outcome, including maladaptive cognitive and emotional factors. Yet, current preoperative education, which focuses on anatomy and biomechanics of the lumbar spine, is ineffective in changing those maladaptive factors. PPNE was introduced as an innovative therapy that addresses modifiable risk factors in patients undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy. PPNE reconceptualizes pain, informs patients about their pain development and is well established for improving maladaptive cognitions in several chronic pain-populations. Hence, we hypothesize that PPNE will be more effective than perioperative biomedical education in improving postsurgical quality of life, pain, analgesic use and return to work in patients at risk for unfavorable outcome following surgery for lumbar radiculopathy. First, a multicentric randomized controlled trial will compare the therapy effects of PPNE to perioperative biomedical education in these at-risk patients. Next, the mediating role of changes in maladaptive cognitions, such as fear of movement and pain catastrophizing, on the therapy effect of PPNE will be investigated.","Study rationale: Lumbar radiculopathy is described as uni- or bilateral leg pain which is often worse than back pain, with pain radiating in the related dermatomes and possible associations with sensory and/or motor symptoms or even deficits. Although surgical intervention for lumbar radiculopathy is often considered anatomically successful, several patients undergoing similar surgeries continue to experience pain and disability. Furthermore, patients developing such an unfavorable outcome also report decreased quality of life values, as well as an increase in analgesic use and health care utilization. Such unfavorable outcome is associated with a multitude of preoperative factors, including but not limited to maladaptive cognitive and emotional factors (e.g., fear of movement, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, distress and depression), preexisting chronic pain and long duration of preoperative sick leave. In line with this, it has been suggested that maladaptive psychological factors require special attention and optimization before surgery. Perioperative pain neuroscience education (PPNE) is such an intervention addressing these maladaptive psychological factors, such as fear of movement and pain catastrophizing. Therefore, a study assessing the effectiveness of PPNE on surgical outcome in at-risk patients undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy is warranted.

Rationale for study design: The present study builds on the evidence provided by the study of Louw et al. (2014 \& 2016) which was a randomized controlled trial comparing PPNE with no supplemental intervention in patients undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy. As such, we will conduct a multicentric randomized controlled trial investigating the therapy effect of PPNE specifically in patients with lumbar radiculopathy at risk for unfavorable surgical outcome. Doing this we will address several knowledge gaps by comparing two balanced therapy groups (PPNE vs perioperative biomedical education (PBE)), therefore overcoming potential bias due to unbalanced treatment arms, by adding several relevant outcome measures, and by targeting high-risk patients rather than all patients undergoing surgery.

Study objectives: The primary objective is to examine whether PPNE is more effective than PBE in improving postoperative quality of life at 6 weeks follow-up in patients undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy at risk for unfavorable surgical outcome. Secondary objectives include: 1) to explore baseline associations between pain cognitions, quality of life and pain in patients scheduled for surgery for lumbar radiculopathy at risk for unfavorable outcome; 2) to examine whether PPNE is more effective than PBE in obtaining good surgical results concerning quality of life, pain, analgesic use, return to work, self-reported symptoms of central sensitization and pain cognitions at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year post-surgery and 3) to reveal the mediating role of changes in pain cognitions in the mechanism behind the therapy effect of PPNE in patients undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy at risk for unfavorable outcome.

Study design: This study is a randomized controlled trial with one-year follow-up using preoperative patient screening based on chronic pain (≥ 6 months), kinesiophobia (Tamp Scale for Kinesiophobia ≥ 37/68) and pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale ≥ 30/52). Eligible patients undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy will be randomized and receive either the experimental intervention, i.e., PPNE, or the control intervention, i.e., PBE. Follow-up assessments will be organized at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months following the surgery.

Patient recruitment: All patients scheduled for surgery for lumbar radiculopathy in one of the participating hospitals will be contacted by telephone by the coordinating investigator. First, patients will be informed about the project and asked if they are willing to participate. When patients agree with participating in the study, they will be screened for potential eligibility using the in- and exclusion criteria. Following the initial screening, patients will have to meet an additional set of presurgical criteria (i.e., chronic pain, pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia) to assess whether they are at risk for unfavorable surgical outcome, and therefore eligible for inclusion in the study sample. To screen for these presurgical criteria, patients eligible for further screening after the initial telephone interview, will be asked to complete an online survey questioning the three aforementioned criteria. The first page of the online survey will inform the patients once again about the goal of the screening and all patients will have to indicate their consent (by checking a box) before they can proceed to the actual questionnaire.

Randomization and blinding procedures: Following baseline assessments, participants will be randomized to one of both treatment groups. Concealed randomization will be prepared using a stratified permuted block allocation with stratification for treatment center. Randomization will be executed by an independent researcher who is not involved in the recruitment, assessments, treatment provision or statistical analyses. Patients will not know whether the intervention they receive is the experimental or the control intervention, however they will of course be aware of the content of the received intervention. A co-investigator, who will be responsible for baseline assessment and all follow-up assessments, will also be blinded to group allocation. With regard to this, patients will be asked not to communicate with the co-investigator about the intervention they received. The therapists providing the experimental treatment will not be involved in providing the control intervention and vice versa.

Sample size: Sample size was calculated to be 108 (54 per intervention group) based on a medium effect size of 0.6, α of 0.05, desired power of 0.80, an allocation ratio (N2/N1) of 1 and an anticipated loss to follow-up of 20%. A longitudinal pilot study in patients undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy and who were retrospectively selected based on chronic pain (≥3 months), kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia ≥37/68) and pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale ≥30/52) was performed and evaluated the effect of PPNE on Short-Form 36-item, these results were used to determine the effect size for the sample size calculation.

Statistical analysis: Descriptive and correlation analyses will be performed on the baseline data. An AN(C)OVA repeated measures analysis will be used to evaluate treatment effects (primary and secondary objective). Lastly, a mediation analysis will be performed to examine the potential mediating role of changes in pain cognitions on the therapy effect of PPNE on quality of life.",TERMINATED,Recruitment issues that could not be resolved in a timely manner.,2021-09-30,2023-10-16,2023-10-16,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,DOUBLE,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,6,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Perioperative Pain Neuroscience Education"", ""type"": ""BEHAVIORAL"", ""description"": ""Perioperative pain neuroscience education addresses modifiable preoperative risk factors, and in particular cognitive and emotional risk factors, such as fear of movement and pain catastrophizing (i.e., excessively negative orientation toward pain).

OTHER,NCT01739179,Keyhole Surgery for the Positioning of the Distal Catheter in Ventricular Peritoneal Shunt Placement,"Laparoscopically Assisted Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Placement: A Prospective, Randomized Two-arm Study","Ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) was first described at the beginning of the 20th century as a diversionary procedure in patients with a hydrocephalus. After the introduction of silastic catheters in the 1970's this method became the treatment of choice for children and adults with communicating hydrocephalus. The average patient necessitating VPS will undergo at least two shunt revisions every three years, with some patients requiring more than twenty revisions within the first year. Therefore, any technical improvement with a positive impact on the revision rate not only benefits the patient through a reduction of the surgical burden but may also have economic advantages.

Distal shunt failures - either due to improper placement or secondary dislocation of the distal catheter out of the peritoneal cavity - have been reported in 10-30% of cases. Catheter placement in obese patients and in patients with adhesions owing to previous abdominal surgery remains challenging. Most neurosurgeons will carry out a mini-laparotomy to allow for the placement of the distal catheter end within the peritoneal cavity, which rarely requires the help of a general or visceral surgeon.

An alternative to laparotomy is the laparoscopic placement of the peritoneal catheter in VPS. Retrospective series have since shown the safety of this procedure and suggested an advantage of laparoscopic VPS in terms of operation duration, length of hospital stay and the rate of distal (and thus potentially overall) shunt dysfunction.

The evidence concerning the effect of laparoscopic surgery for VPS placement is so far based on non-randomized studies, in which a selection bias may have influenced the outcomes.","Background

Ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) as diversionary procedure in patients with hydrocephalus was first described in 1908. After the introduction of silastic catheters during the 1970s this method has become the treatment of choice for children and adults with communicating hydrocephalus. However, the average patient having had VPS will undergo 2.1 shunt revisions every 3 years of life, with a wide range from no revisions during the first decade to up to 21 revisions within the first year. For this reason technical improvements impacting positively on the revision rate and on the surgical burden are strongly needed.

In the standard VPS procedure the proximal part of the shunt is first placed in one of the lateral ventricles. The distal part of the shunt is then tunneled subcutaneously from the head to the abdomen, where 20-25 cm of the distal catheter and the tip are introduced in the peritoneal cavity through a paraumbilical mini-laparotomy. The intraperitoneal placement of the distal catheter is performed blindly, whereby the tip of the catheter is directed caudally in direction of the pelvis in order to avoid kinking and potential strangulation of the catheter. In this setting the functionality of the system can be estimated by feeling the resistance to out- and inflow while manually pumping the reservoir near the valve at the cranial level.

Distal shunt failure has been reported to occur in 10-30% of cases. Secondary dislocation of the peritoneal catheter in the subcutaneous tissue or its improper placement in the peritoneal cavity during the procedure both contribute to this high shunt failure rate. Furthermore, blind catheter placement in obese patients and in patients with adhesions from previous abdominal surgery can be a challenge and may lead to injuries of the intra-abdominal organs.

In 1993, Bassauri et al reported on the laparoscopic placement of the peritoneal catheter in VPS. Since then several, small retrospective series have shown good results in laparoscopic VPS, both in terms of efficacy and safety, in adults and in children. Two larger series were published recently. Schubert et al. reported a prospective study on 50 adult patients using the laparoscopically assisted peritoneal shunt insertion. A retrospective cohort of 50 matched patients served as a control. They reported no intraoperative complications, a longer operation time in the laparoscopic group (59 versus 49 minutes), 2 malfunctions (4%) and 1 infection in the laparoscopic group (2%) and 6 malfunctions (12%) and 6 infections (12%) in the historic cohort, the difference being statistically significant in favour of the laparoscopic group. In the most recent and largest series published to date, Bani et al. report on their experience with 151 patients, where the peritoneal catheter was implanted using a laparoscopic technique. They also used a retrospective cohort of 50 non-laparoscopy patients as a control. The operation time was slightly longer using the laparoscopic technique (35-130 versus 30-120 minutes), the infection rate was 2% in both groups. They describe no dislocation of the distal catheter in the abdominal wall and no malpositioning of the distal catheter in the laparoscopic group and 4 such cases in the non-laparoscopy group (8%).

In summary, these non-randomized trials suggest the safety of the procedure. The laparoscopic technique offers at least theoretically some significant advantages over the standard technique. The laparoscopic introduction of the peritoneal catheter allows for intra-abdominal inspection, lyses of adhesions whenever necessary, confirmation of the catheter position, and the visual assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the catheter tip during the procedure. Due to the minimal trauma to the abdominal wall the laparoscopic access also has the potential of reducing postoperative adhesions, wound complications and the overall postoperative morbidity. Despite these theoretical advantages, however, comparative, randomized data are lacking and ventriculoperitoneal shunting is still performed through a minilaparotomy in the vast majority of neurosurgical centres. The absence of scientific evidence favouring the laparoscopic technique, the lack of training of neurosurgeons in laparoscopic techniques and the potential prolongation of the operating time (and potentially a higher risk of infection) are probably the main reasons to explain why the shift to the laparoscopic technique has not yet taken place. Also, theoretically, the inflation of the peritoneal cavity for laparoscopy could potentially generate an acute hydrocephalus (e.g. during a distal revision) due to the elimination of the pressure gradient necessary to obtain flow of CSF into the peritoneal cavity.

These potential limitations warrant, in our view, a prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing the standard (minilaparotomy) technique. The demonstration of the superiority of the laparoscopic technique in a prospective, randomized study has the potential of changing the standard of care for patients with hydrocephalus needing shunting.

The incidence of neonatal seizures is variable based on gestational age. The etiology of seizures may indicate the presence of a potentially treatable etiology and should prompt an immediate evaluation to determine the cause and to initiate etiology-specific therapy. Importantly, the earlier treatment of seizures positively affects the infant's long-term neurological development. However, even when continue electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is available, the availability of on-site expertise to interpret cEEG signals is limited and in practice, the diagnosis is still based only on clinical signs. The previous study indicated that the reliable seizure detection was as little as 10% of seizure events. Therefore, an early automated seizure detection tool has been developed based on machine learning. The lack of an automated seizure detection tool has been validated in the external neonatal seizures cohort. The evidence on the utility of the automated seizure detection tool remains uncertain.

OTHER,NCT01871779,Effect of Exercise Training on Protein Expression in Skeletal Muscle Tissue After Exercise in Peripheral Arterial Disease,"The Effect of Different Forms of Exercise on Both the Clinical, Systemic and Local Biological Responses in Intermittent Claudication","Cardiovascular disease remain one of the leading causes of death in Australia, accounting for 47637 (36%) of deaths in 2004.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a category of cardiovascular disease, characterised by intermittent claudication. This is defined as walking induced pain, cramping, aching, tiredness or heaviness in one or both legs that does not go away with continued walking and is relieved with rest. It is estimated that between 5-10% of individuals aged over 50 years suffer from claudication. The primary and most effective treatment for these patients is focused on improving walking ability and functional status.

Current research has shown that approximately 30% of patients improve with exercise, while 30% continue to deteriorate and the rest show no change. The changes produced at a biochemical and cellular level due to exercise are unknown. To help better understand this, our study will assess the entire range of proteins expressed before and after exercise in the skeletal muscle tissue of patients with intermittent claudication. This will help to identifying key proteins that have a role in improving patient symptoms and outcome.","Why is this clinical problem important?

Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a major health problem in Australia, with a prevalence of 15% in males aged over 65 years. The direct health care cost of PAD in Australia was $180m in 1994, of which 78% was associated with hospitalisations. PAD is also a marker for advanced cardiovascular disease (CVD) involving coronary, cerebral, renal and aortic vessels; with a 2-3 fold increased risk of CVD-related mortality. In 2006-2007, 25,813 hospitalizations and 2,163 deaths were a result of PAD (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2009). The ageing Australian population and the prevalence of PAD increases (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2009), the national annual health expenditure on cardiovascular disease is likely to increase, greatly exceeding the 5.4 billion dollars spent in 2000-01 (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006). The most frequent symptom of mild to moderate PAD is intermittent claudication (IC), defined as walking-induced pain and cramping in one or both legs (most often calves) that is relieved with rest. The primary and most effective treatment for people with intermittent claudication is focused on improving walking ability and functional status.

What is already known about the effect of exercise in intermittent claudication?

The beneficial effects of exercise training as a treatment have been confirmed in several randomised controlled trials. The optimum form of exercise still hasn't been elucidated. The mechanisms of improvement of claudication with exercise are largely unknown. Although exercise stimulates an ischaemic-reperfusion (I-R) insult, repetitive exercise may produce an adaptive response to this I-R insult. Other potential themes include effect of exercise on stimulating or inhibiting angiogenesis and/or muscle protein synthesis.

Although the principal cause of IC is reduced blood flow to the lower limbs relative to increased demand during exercise, the pathophysiology of IC is not completely understood. For example, limb haemodynamics does not closely correlate with clinical presentation or the limitations in peak exercise performance. Haemodynamic measures of the severity of PAD, such as the ankle-brachial systolic blood pressure index (ABI) and blood flow by strain gauge plethysmography, are poor predictors of exercise capacity in patients with IC.

Cross-sectional studies indicate that inflammation is associated with the presence, progression and severity of PAD. This may explain the excess cardiovascular mortality, (at least 50% at 10 years), seen in these patients. The effect of exercise on claudication has been most studied with inflammatory markers in peripheral blood.

What is the importance of measuring protein expression in muscle tissue?

While peripheral blood bio-markers help in understanding the systemic manifestations of claudication, it does not reflect what is happening in the muscles and microcirculation. Most of the changes in protein expression are too subtle to be detected in peripheral blood. The ease of acquisition does not correspond to ease of interrogation. The dynamic range of proteins in serum makes analysis very challenging because high abundance proteins tend to mask those of lower abundance; whilst a small number of proteins including albumin, Beta 2-macroglobulin, transferrin, and immunoglobulins may represent over 90% of serum proteins11.

The protein complement of a cell or tissue is dynamic and reflects the age, life-cycle, and conditions the cell is subjected to or a specific disease state. It is clear that in most diseases, proteins are subjected to numerous changes including post-translational modifications and/or proteolytic cleavage; equally in certain diseases, there is alteration of protein expression. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is the molecule encoding the chemical blueprint for a protein. Yet the micro arrays examining differential expression of mRNA will not provide information on post-translational modification, therefore the only way to assess the impact of the proteins is at the protein level.

Some studies have investigated the difference in histochemical and biochemical characteristics of skeletal muscle between patients with PAD and healthy age-matched subjects. Most of the studies into muscle biopsy from patients with PAD have demonstrated alterations in muscle fibre type distribution, denervation and alterations in muscle metabolism with no insight into protein expression12, 13, 14. There is considerable evidence that the metabolic status of skeletal muscle is perturbed in patients with PAD as compared with age-matched healthy controls. Amongst the earliest observations was the unexpected finding that the expression and activity of several mitochondrial enzymes are increased in skeletal muscle from limbs with PAD. The skeletal muscles in patients with IC, do change with exercise but the current evidence does not shed light on the mechanisms of change or if the change is the same in all patients. We do already know that some patients improve with exercise while others do not. A question thus arises as to whether there exists a bio-diversity in these patients' response to exercise.

Armstrong et al studied disturbances in calcium homeostasis of skeletal muscle and suggested that they might play a key role in the development of exercise-induced muscle damage. Some of the immediate muscle changes after exercise have been attributed to protein degradation is initiated by non-lysosomal cysteine proteases, such as calpain. The elevation in intracellular calcium post-exercise can activate the calpains. Muscle tissue expresses three distinct calpains, including the well-characterized ubiquitous calpains - m- calpain, μ-calpain and n-calpain. Wang et al have concluded, in animal studies, that the increased levels of the protease m-calpain, promotes muscle injury whereas the calpastatin protein expression might execute a protective function for muscle injury. This has not yet been investigated in human studies. It can be hypothesised that the levels of calpastatin and m-calpain are important in explaining the variable response to exercise in IC and why some patients improve and others do not.

There is some conflicting evidence on the benefit of exercise. Tsai et al have found that the normal training effect on the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) gene expression was completely eliminated by both acute and chronic ischemia at the pre-translational level. In addition, the chronic ischemia-induced muscle atrophy was seen to be more severe in the exercise-trained rats than in the untrained rats. This result suggests that for individuals with impaired microvascular conditions, exercise training might not be beneficial in maintaining muscle mass. Thus the effect of exercise training in human subjects with IC (ischaemia) is yet to be elucidated.

We know that all subjects differ in their capacity for exercise and patients with intermittent claudication are no different. Patients undergoing exercise for intermittent claudication, would be different in terms of their expression of proteins due to exercise. For this reason, patients would act as their own controls by means of a biopsy from an unaffected muscle of each individual.

An open ended mass spectroscopy examination of proteins in the exercising skeletal muscle would give an insight into the mechanistic pathway of the exercise effect in intermittent claudication.

What is the relation between protein expression and inflammation in the exercise with intermittent claudication?

The clinical model of exercise inducing an ischaemia-reperfusion type injury has been substantiated by evidence of markers of inflammation. Neutrophils are the first cells to begin accumulating in the tissue at the injury site, destroying necrotic tissue through phagocytosis while working in conjunction with resident macrophages from the muscle tissue itself. Neutrophil presence has been documented in muscle after various types of eccentric exercise. A study looking at neutrophil function in exercising claudicants showed increased neutrophil activation manifest by increased expression of the neutrophil adhesion receptor cluster of differentiation antigen IIb (CD11b) and degranulation manifest by an increase in plasma neutrophil elastase. This occurred immediately after exercise in these patients with intermittent claudication. Whether this equates to a trend to predict outcomes is still not clear.

The protease m-Calpain is chemotactic factor for neutrophils and may play a role in the local and systemic inflammatory response. Such adaptations in cellular inflammatory responses have been reported earlier by Kunimatsu et al. Together with Calpastatin, these proteins may hold a key in the link between local muscle damage, repair and inducing a systemic inflammatory response.

Chemical modification of proteins may play a role in the pathogenesis of disorders ranging from diabetes to atherosclerosis and ischemia-reperfusion injury and perhaps to the aging process itself. Advanced Glycosylation End products (AGEs) are the end products of glycosylation reactions in which a sugar molecule bonds to either a protein or lipid molecule without an enzyme to control the reaction. The formation and accumulation of AGEs has been implicated in the progression of age related disease, in particular cardiovascular disease. They have a range of pathological effects, including inhibition of vascular dilatation by interfering with nitric oxide (Endothelium Derived Relaxation factor), binding macrophage and endothelial cells to induce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and enhancing oxidative stress. We hypothesise that exercise stimulates glucose uptake by the endothelial cells increasing the synthesis of AGE's. It remains to be determined whether exercise again enhances or reduces this process.

The aim of this study is to examine inflammatory biomarkers, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Neutrophil elastase and Advanced Glycated End-products with proteins known to influence tissue damage or repair (Calpains and Calpastatin) to determine the effect of different forms of exercise on this process, in order to determine

1. Is exercise appropriate for all patients? i.e.

   1. Do all patients respond with a pro inflammatory response? and
   2. Does exercise produce an adaptive response to this in all patients? or
   3. Does exercise stimulate an I-R insult in some patients that is not reduced by exercise training?
   4. What is the local tissue response to exercise in terms of tissue damage or repair (as measured by protein analysis)
2. What is the best form of exercise for these suitable patients?
3. Is there a biodiversity in patients' response to exercise in terms of

   1. Systemic inflammatory response (based on IL-6, Neutrophil Elastase \& AGE's)?
   2. Local response (based on protein analysis)?
4. Does the physiological response to exercise in these patients reduce the risk of CVD related morbidity/mortality?

   a. As evidenced by changes in cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) outcome parameters and endothelial function.
5. Is impaired endothelial function reversible? a. As measured by flow-mediated dilatation.

OTHER,NCT02481479,Saxagliptin and Cardiac Structure and Function,SCARF: Saxagliptin on CArdiac StRucture and Function,"Diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of heart failure, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the development of new therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control, recent clinical data from the saxagliptin assessment of vascular outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (SAVOR-TIMI) 53 study observed an unexpected finding of an excess of adjudicated heart failure hospitalizations. This excess occurred in the setting of pre-existing heart failure (HF) hospitalization and in those with elevated biomarkers for heart failure such as N terminal pro Brain type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). A wealth of preclinical data did not suggest a mechanistic basis for an excess of heart failure events, however these preclinical studies primarily focused upon prevention based strategies as opposed to regression studies once established heart failure was present. This proposal seeks to understand if and how dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i,specifically saxagliptin) may influence the development of heart failure, by evaluating changes in cardiac structure and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).","The cardiovascular safety and potential cardioprotective effects of diabetes drugs have been the focus of recent research. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all new anti-diabetic drugs to demonstrate no important increase in cardiovascular adverse events before approval.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are oral incretin-based agents that increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level, with proven anti-hyperglycemic effects and are increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes. In a rat model of diabetes and myocardial infarction, sitagliptin treatment improved passive left ventricular compliance, increased endothelial cell density, reduced myocyte hypertrophy and collagen abundance. GLP-1 and DDP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin improve cardiac function, cardiac remodeling, and survival in animal models of pressure-overload and chronic heart failure. However, in another study of post-MI cardiac remodeling in mice, vildagliptin failed to show any early or late protective effects on cardiac function.

Some clinical studies suggest that GLP-1 infusion is associated with an absolute increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure, although data are conflicting. The GLP-1 receptor analog, exenatide may reduce infarct size in patients with myocardial infarction but does not improve LVEF.

The Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Alogliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome EXAMINE trial randomized assigned 5340 patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome to alogliptin or placebo, and found no increase in adverse cardiovascular events in the alogliptin group. In SAVOR-TIMI 53, 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events were randomized to receive saxagliptin or placebo. Over a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P=0.99 for superiority; P\<0.001 for noninferiority). However, patients in the saxagliptin group were more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure, which was not ascertained in the EXAMINE trial. Furthermore, the Sitagliptin Cardiovascular Outcome Study (TECOS), which examined the DPP4i sitagliptin versus placebo in high risk patients for a cardiovascular event demonstrated cardiovascular safety (P\<0.001 for non inferiority), and there was no signal for excess heart failure hospitalizations.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as the ""gold standard"" for measuring LV volume, mass, and ejection fraction. LV volume measurements by cardiac MRI do not rely on geometric assumptions. CMR measurements have excellent intra-observer, inter-observer, and inter-study variability, which were superior to other imaging techniques. The high inter-study reproducibility of CMR affords a substantial reduction in the required sample size to demonstrate even small changes in LV volume, LV mass or LVEF, or conversely, to reliably exclude clinically important changes. Furthermore, CMR tagging allows detailed and quantitative assessment of regional LV diastolic and systolic function. For example, in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), CMR can detect subtle alterations in global and regional LV functions in patients with traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Although prior studies have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects of improved glycemic control on myocardial function, CMR promises to be a more sensitive and accurate technique.

Accordingly, the investigators propose to use CMR to examine the cardiac structure, global and regional function among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with saxagliptin.",COMPLETED,,2015-06,2018-08,2018-08,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE4,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,TREATMENT,18,ACTUAL,"[{""name"": ""Saxagliptin"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Eligible patients will undergo baseline CMR, commence treatment and then after 6 months undergo repeat CMR"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""Saxagliptin"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Eligible patients will undergo baseline echocardiogram, commence treatment and then after 6 months undergo repeat echocardiogram"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}, {""name"": ""saxagliptin"", ""type"": ""DRUG"", ""description"": ""Eligible patients will undergo baseline venipuncture, commence treatment and then after 6 months undergo repeat venipuncture"", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",DRUG;DRUG;DRUG,saxagliptin;saxagliptin;saxagliptin,1

Laser Fluorescent Imaging of Abdominal Skin During Abdominoplasty.

Background/Purpose

Abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) is a common cosmetic operation. One of the risks of surgery is delayed wound healing caused by impaired circulation to the skin. In an effort to reduce risk, some investigators1 advocate a limited-undermining technique, with preservation of the perforating blood vessels and preservation of the Scarpa fascia of the lower abdomen. However, there is no evidence that this limited-undermining technique improves blood supply compared with a traditional abdominoplasty dissection. Such a limited dissection may compromise the cosmetic result.

This study was undertaken to investigate the blood supply of the abdominal skin during the abdominoplasty procedure. By testing the circulation at two points during the dissection, and a third time after completion of the operation, data may be obtained and used to evaluate the effect of the extent of the dissection on blood supply of the skin flap.

Laser fluorescent imaging represents an objective measurement technique that has been used to quantitate blood supply in skin flaps and other tissues. It has been used for several years to monitor the vascularity of flaps used in breast reconstruction. This technique has also been used previously in patients undergoing abdominoplasty.2

Subjects

Twenty consecutive consenting adult men and women undergoing outpatient elective abdominoplasty will be investigated using laser fluorescent imaging. By testing the blood supply at three time points, the patient serves as his or her own control.

Imaging

The SPY Elite Intraoperative Perfusion Assessment System (Lifecell Corp., Branchburg, NJ) consists of a near-infrared laser that detects fluorescence. The imaging agent, indocyanine green, is absorbed at this region of the spectrum, 800-810 nm. The imaging agent is injected intravenously. Starting within 5-10 seconds of injection, the system records images of the abdomen, showing the fluorescence, which indicates blood supply. The half-life of the imaging agent is 2.5-3 minutes. The imaging agent is metabolized by the liver. The only known risk is an allergic reaction to the imaging agent. Patients with a history of an allergic reaction to iodinated contrast dyes are excluded.

Surgery

The lipoabdominoplasty technique is performed as described by Saldanha et al.1 Following this limited dissection, 3 mL (7.5 mg) of indocyanine green is injected and the abdominal image is recorded, documenting blood supply to the lower abdomen. After further dissection, another 3 mL of imaging agent is injected and the lower abdomen is re-imaged. On completion of surgery, a third injection is administered and a final image is recorded.

Null Hypothesis

A traditional abdominoplasty dissection does not compromise circulation compared with a more limited dissection technique.

Informed Consent

Patients are informed as to the nature of the study and are told that their participation is entirely voluntary and they are free to decline, and that doing so does not in any way prejudice their treatment. Patients are informed of the small risk of an allergic reaction that will be treated if it occurs.

Patient Risk

There is no patient risk apart from a very small risk of allergic reaction, which is further reduced by excluding any patient with a known allergy to iodinated contrast dye. The study does not affect patient treatment. It offers the possibility of detection of reduced skin circulation, information that can be used by the surgeon to limit the dissection if necessary and avoid tissue loss and delayed wound healing, known complications of abdominoplasty.

Sample Size

A sample of 20 patients is anticipated, treated over a period of approximately 6 months.

NIH,NCT00021879,Visceral Adiposity and CVD Risk in Women,,To investigate the influence of total body fat and visceral fat on risk factors of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in black and white women.,"BACKGROUND:

Obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Concern about obesity has increased as the prevalence and severity have increased and the age of onset has decreased. It has also become clear that the location of fat may play an important role in determining the risk associated with obesity. Intra-abdominal fat has been shown to have particularly adverse consequences related to cardiovascular risk factors. Of interest is the fact that a number of studies have shown that the impact of overall adiposity differs by race. For each unit increase in adiposity, blacks appear to have less of an increase in blood pressure and triglycerides and less of a decrease in HDL cholesterol compared to whites. This racial difference in the relationship of adiposity to cardiovascular risk status may be related to differences in the distribution of fat. It is hypothesized that for a given level and increase in total body fat (measured by DEXA) black women will have less intra-abdominal fat (measured by magnetic resonance imaging).

The cohort to be studied is a defined group of black and white women who were initially recruited into the study as children at age nine or 10 years as part of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute National Growth and Health Study. The cohort has been maintained and studied continuously over the past 11 to 12 years with about 75 percent of the original cohort remaining.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Subjects will be studied at age 23 and again at age 25 years. At each examination, subjects will have measurement of total fat (DEXA), intra-abdominal fat (MRI), fasting lipids and lipoproteins, insulin and glucose, blood pressure, and left ventricular mass (by echocardiography). In addition, the timing of pubertal maturation and dietary intake of fat and sucrose will be evaluated as potential determinants of intra-abdominal fat using data previously collected from age nine years to age 22 years. Study of this cohort provides a unique opportunity to evaluate whether differences in deposition of intraabdominal fat are related to racial differences in the relationship between adiposity and cardiovascular risk factors. It will also allow evaluation of childhood and adolescent determinants of adult intra-abdominal adiposity. The results of this investigation may provide insight into the prevention of intra-abdominal fat accumulation and ultimate lowering of risk for cardiovascular disease.",COMPLETED,,2001-03,2006-02,2006-02,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,0,,[],,,1

The study will have three phases, Phase 1, Phase 2a and Phase 2b.

Phase 1 is a standard cohort dose escalation 3+3 design with a modified Fibonacci dose escalation used to determine the maximum tolerated dose to select a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NEO212 for Phase 2a and Phase 2b. The initial dose of NEO212 will be 170 mg and the dose will increase in successive cohorts (220, 400, 610, 810, and 1,000 mg) until a MTD is reached and a RP2D is selected. There will be up to 42 patients enrolled in Phase 1. In the event two DLTs are experienced in any cohort, a dose de- escalation cohort will be followed (with half of the dose increase from the previous cohort) to determine the MTD/RP2D.

Phase 2a is a safety run-in study with a standard 3+3 design used to confirm the safety of the MTD/RP2D of NEO212 when given in combination with select SOC regimens (as defined in Appendix 1) for patients with uncontrolled metastases to the brain (see Appendix 2). There will be up to 12 patients enrolled into each combination regimen to confirm safety. One dose below the NEO212 MTD/RP2D Cohort Dose will be administered as a starting dose to establish safety (3+3), before moving to Phase 2b with the MTD/RP2D (3+3). In the event that two DLTs are experienced for patients receiving the MTD/RP2D in combination with SOC, the dose de-escalation cohort will be expanded to determine the MTD for a newly established Phase 2b Treatment Group.

Phase 2b is a dose expansion study to assess efficacy of NEO212 alone, at the MTD/RP2D in patients with Astrocytoma IDH-mutant, Glioblastoma IDH-wildtype as a single Treatment Group. A second Treatment Group to study the MTD/RP2D of NEO212 in combination with select SOC regimens in patients with solid tumors and uncontrolled metastases to the brain established in Phase 2a will be evaluated.

It was recently reported that only 18% to 49% of heart transplant recipients developed antibodies after 2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. Following the published results, it is currently recommended to use 3 doses in organ transplant recipients who have not contracted COVID-19 and 2 doses in those who have been infected. The effectiveness of this strategy is not yet sufficiently evaluated in heart transplant recipients. Moreover, the factors associated with the humoral and cellular response, the kinetics and durability of the humoral response, the occurrence of the cellular immune response and the tolerance of the vaccine are not well known in this population.

To provide answers to these different questions, we set ourselves the objective of evaluating the humoral and cellular response to messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in heart transplant recipients followed at Bichat Hospital.","In order to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of currently adopted vaccination strategies in heart transplant recipients we intend to study the humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in heart transplant recipients followed at Bichat Hospital.

The vaccination schedule was 3 doses for the seronegative patients without documented infection, and 2 doses for patients who were seropositive or had a positive Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. Most patients were vaccinated at Bichat Hospital. Their vaccination schedule will be recovered. Some patients refused vaccination.

Since the beginning of 2020, the transplant patients have benefited from systematic serological tests and RT-PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs in the event of symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of routine care. The results of these tests will be retrieved from medical records retrospectively in order to investigate the kinetics and durability of the humoral response. Demographic and clinical data will be collected to determine the factors associated with vaccine response.

In addition, a whole blood sample will be drawn at inclusion in order to evaluate cellular response. The patients will be also asked to answer a questionnaire regarding vaccine tolerance.

This study involves collection of blood samples from the patients who meet the inclusion criteria. Our goal is to be able to see if there is any difference between the two groups of patients.

2 Study Objectives

Primary Objective: Assess difference in laboratory values between two groups of patients.

Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in laboratory values between DH and NDH

3 Study Design

3.1 General Design This is a exploratory study to assess the difference in the lab values in two groups of patients. Patients that present to University of Minnesota Medical Center with acute ischemic stroke and are hyperglycemic (Blood sugar of more than 130 mg/dl) will be eligible for the study. Pre-specified volume of blood will be collected for lab analysis. This study does not involve testing of any procedure, drug or device.

Step One - Identify patients that have Ischemic strokes and have hyperglycemia \>130 mg/dl.

Step Two:

- Obtain Consent from patient or POA.

Step Three:(Once consent obtained) - Collect first set of blood samples from patients with the first blood draw between 0-8 hours from time of ER arrival. Second blood sample will be collected in 9-16 hours and a 3rd one in 17-24 hour period.

Step Four:

- No further data will be collected from patient.

OTHER,NCT06363279,Validation of the French ATI Scale and Predisposition to Use Technological Tools in Rehabilitation.,Validation of the French Translation of the Affinity for Technology Interaction (ATI) Scale Questionnaire and Assessment of the Predisposition of Healthy Adults and Stroke Survivors to Use Technological Tools in Rehabilitation.,"Aim of the study: The first aim of this study is to validate the translation of the Affinity for Technology Interaction (ATI) questionnaire. This questionnaire was developed in English by Franke, Attig and Wessel in 2019. It consists of 9 items and was developed to assess a person's tendency to actively engage in technological interaction, or the ease with which a person uses technological tools. Currently, the questionnaire has been translated into French by our research team according to good practice recommendations, but this French version has not yet been validated. To validate the translation of a questionnaire, it is necessary to have it completed by a large number of subjects from the population of interest. In neurorehabilitation, measuring this affinity will make it possible to better identify patients who are more likely to adhere to tele-rehabilitation and thus direct them towards this type of treatment as a complement to conventional rehabilitation.

The second objective is to determine the extent to which the general population is prepared to use technological tools as part of their rehabilitation. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the profile of people who could potentially benefit from tele-rehabilitation. Accessibility to the technologies, their expectations and barriers will also be explored as part of this study.","The primary objective of this cross-sectional study is to validate the French translation of the ""Affinity for Technology Interaction"" questionnaire in the general adult population and in an adult population that has suffered a stroke.

The secondary objective is to assess the propensity of these populations to use technological tools in everyday life and in rehabilitation.

The experiment is a cross-sectional study (online and paper survey). Subjects will be recruited in two ways: 1) via the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc; 2) via posters/flyers in paper and digital formats, the Internet (social networks), public places (university, etc.), acquaintances of the participants and of the research team, and via colleagues of the doctors/physiotherapists (samples of convenience and ""snowballing""). Posters and publications on social networks will include information about the experiment and a link to the online questionnaire.

People who want to take part in the online survey will have to click on the link to be directed to the questionnaire on REDCap. Once they have given their consent electronically, i.e. by ticking 'yes' to 'I agree to take part in this study of my own free will', the questionnaire will appear and participants will be able to complete it (this will take approximately 5-10 minutes). Once they have completed the questionnaire, their participation in the study will be terminated. The questionnaire will be available online for a period of 12 months.

For people who wish to take part in the paper survey, after signing the information and consent documents, they will complete the paper version of the questionnaire with the assistance of an investigator. Once the questionnaire has been completed, their participation in the study will be terminated.

Selection criteria for subjects to be included in the experiment (all randomly selected subjects, all evaluable subjects, etc.).

- Healthy subjects: The healthy subjects included in the study will be volunteers recruited either through the Saint-Luc University Hospitals or through social networks, but also in public places (university), as well as through fellow physiotherapists and doctors. This study will be offered in several French-speaking countries (France, Canada, Belgium).

- People who have had a stroke: Stroke survivors enrolled in the study will be volunteers recruited either through the Saint-Luc University Hospitals Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department or through social networks and public places.

Precise statement of the main data to be evaluated during the experiment. The questionnaire (see appendix) is divided into 4 main sections: general information; French version of the ATI questionnaire; face validity and perceived usefulness; predisposition to use new technologies.

* General information: Questions on age, gender, postal code, country, socio-professional status and level of education. These data will be used to describe the sample studied (descriptive statistics) and to obtain the information needed to determine the factors associated with the ATI questionnaire score in multiple linear regression analyses. For post-stroke subjects, the questionnaire will be completed with information on the date of stroke, its functional classification, Rankin score and MOCA.
* French version of the ATI questionnaire: Questionnaire consisting of 9 items designed to assess the affinity for interaction with technological systems (such as mobile phones, computers, television, etc.). The response options for each item are in the form of a Likert scale ranging from ""strongly disagree"" (= 1) to ""strongly agree"" (= 6). A total score including the 9 items is then calculated to obtain the subject's score.
* Face validity and perceived usefulness: Five statements designed to assess the face validity and perceived usefulness of the questionnaire to respondents. The response options for each statement are in the form of a Likert scale ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree'.
* Predisposition to use technology: Questionnaire to assess predisposition to use new technologies in general and specifically in telerehabilitation. This questionnaire includes questions about the rehabilitation that the subjects are currently undergoing (type, frequency, investment and difficulties of access), as well as their propensity to use new tools (in rehabilitation and in daily life).

Expected duration of subjects' participation. The duration of participation includes only the time needed to complete the questionnaire. Without a break, we estimate that it will take about 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire. After that, participation in the study is over.

Data analysis methods including missing, unused or erroneous data. REDCap software will be used to conduct the surveys. REDCap is a statistical survey and online form creation software. It allows questionnaires to be published on the web or on smartphones to collect data. The software allows anonymous participation and an unlimited number of participants and questions. We can choose the start and end dates for the survey, as well as a server location for secure data storage. Thanks to this software, data collection will take place in real time and we will be able to monitor the results.

We will also be able to obtain the results of the survey in the form of statistics or graphs (e.g. number of responses per question) at any time. The survey results will be exported anonymously and securely in various formats (Excel, CSV, PDF, etc.) for processing and analysis in statistical software.

The data collected via the paper version (mainly for stroke patients) and REDCap will be imported into Excel and analysed using SPSS and R. The face validity, perceived usefulness and other aspects such as the ergonomics of the questionnaire will be assessed via the statements at the end of the questionnaire and the time taken to complete the questionnaire. We will also assess the reliability of the questionnaire by calculating its internal consistency (Cronbach Alpha) and its dimensionality by calculating the number of dimensions (exploratory factorial analysis).

Multiple linear regression analyses will also be carried out to assess the association between certain variables (e.g. age) and the score on the ATI questionnaire. Results are presented as coefficients with their 95% confidence intervals. All p-values are two-tailed and the significance level is set at p = 0.05.",RECRUITING,,2024-04-04,2024-10,2024-09,INTERVENTIONAL,NA,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,NONE,OTHER,1000,ESTIMATED,"[{""name"": ""Conducting questionnaires"", ""type"": ""OTHER"", ""description"": ""The questionnaires will be administered online or in person."", ""mesh_terms"": [], ""other_ids"": []}]",OTHER,conducting questionnaires,0

The investigators will determine the best threshold of TIMP2\*IGFBP7 to distinguish the population of patients who will return to normal kidney function within 72 hours (KDIGO 0).","Background :

Patients with septic shock in the intensive care unit have a high risk to develop acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is an independent risk factor of mortality. Given the absence of validated pharmacological treatments for limiting the progression of AKI or for accelerating recovery from AKI, early intervention and the restoration of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in this context of septic shock might improve the patients' prognosis. One major challenge is therefore how to determine whether or not the AKI is reversible. The best-studied biomarkers (NGAL and KIM 1) have little discriminant power in septic patients because of their poor specificity or unsuitable kinetics for very early diagnosis. The combination of urine assays for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) has shown good diagnostic performance for the very early detection of the risk of developing AKI in the following 12 hrs. Urine levels of these two markers specifically reflect damage to kidney tubules. Moreover, the levels appear to be strongly correlated with the severity of tubule damage. Thus, one can reasonably hypothesize that measurement of these markers in the very early stages of septic shock might determine the presence and severity of kidney tubule damage. A threshold (yet to be defined) would help to differentiate between (i) transient, non-severe injury and (ii) injury that is already too severe to be reversible.

Purpose : to determine whether or not the urine concentration of TIMP2\*IGFBP7 may distinguish patients with high risk of persistent or transient AKI during the early phase of septic shock.",RECRUITING,,2017-05-01,2024-12-01,2024-11-01,OBSERVATIONAL,unknown,,,,,170,ESTIMATED,[],,,0

Paclitaxel and cisplatin may increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy by making the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy to the pelvis plus paclitaxel and cisplatin in treating patients who have cervical cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the toxicity of radiotherapy plus paclitaxel and cisplatin used as radiosensitization in patients with stage IB2, IIA, IIB, IIIB, or IVA invasive carcinoma of the cervix.
* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined with cisplatin plus radiotherapy in these patients.
* Determine the effects of this regimen at the maximum tolerated dose on progression-free survival and overall survival in these patients.
* Determine the site of local or distant recurrence in these patients after treatment with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel.

Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy (RT) to the pelvic region 5 days a week during weeks 1-5. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour immediately followed by cisplatin concurrently with pelvic field radiotherapy on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients undergo low-dose rate (LDR) OR high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. For patients undergoing LDR brachytherapy, intracavitary implants are inserted 1 or 2 times within 3 weeks after completion of external beam RT. For patients undergoing HDR brachytherapy, intracavitary implants are inserted once a week for 5 weeks beginning during week 4 of external beam RT. Patients may receive a parametrial boost.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued and treated at the MTD as above.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter or at time of recurrence until death.
